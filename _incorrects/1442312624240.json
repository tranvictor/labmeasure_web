    "DiffbotBody": "Tweet © Reprints Email Thirteen years ago, following a string of scandals that included Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers to reward big donors, Congress banned lawmakers from raising the unlimited campaign checks known as soft money. Now, soft money is back with a vengeance, just in a different guise. Back then, elected officials scooped up hundreds of millions directly from corporate and labor titans for their parties, often in exchange for special access and legislative favors. Then- Sen. Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who co-authored the soft-money ban with Arizona Republican John McCain, called it “legalized bribery.” Today, lawmakers are once again raising six-figure checks for the political parties — this time for special new accounts that pay for conventions, recounts and buildings. In just the first three months of the year, close to $13 million flowed into this new funding stream — mostly for the GOP. Checks as big as $600,000 and $700,000 are coming in from the likes of hedge fund manager Paul E. Singer, investment banker Warren A. Stephens and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Even bigger donations are fattening super PACs that ostensibly must keep candidates at arm’s length, but which increasingly operate as an appendage of politicians’ campaigns. The upshot is a fundraising bonanza reminiscent of the soft-money era, and even of Watergate. It’s too early to say what rewards big donors will enjoy in exchange for the unrestricted money they’re lavishing on parties and super PACs. But to the authors of the soft-money ban best known as the McCain-Feingold law, the return of high-dollar fundraising by members of Congress spells trouble. “I predict there will be a major scandal because there is too much money washing around,” McCain said at a Harvard University forum last year. The new party rules allow a single donor who gives the maximum to every one of a given party’s special accounts to max out at a whopping $801,600 a year — or $1.6 million per election cycle. That’s a far cry from the individual contribution limits of $2,700 per election to a candidate and $33,400 annually to a party committee — caps that technically still stand but that look increasingly quaint. The Supreme Court has relaxed limits all around. In 2010, the court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling overturned all limits on independent political spending. And last year, in McCutcheon v. FEC, the court struck aggregate limits on how much one donor could give to parties and candidates collectively in an election cycle. The legal firewall between super PACs and the candidates they back is breaking down. By law, candidates may ask super PAC donors for $5,000 in so-called hard, or regulated, money. So White House hopefuls, including five sitting senators, are asking billionaire donors for $5,000 — but the super PACs that back the candidates are pocketing checks in the millions with a wink and a nod. comments powered by Disqus Tweet © Reprints Email “The campaign finance laws prohibit federal office holders from soliciting or raising unlimited contributions,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the watchdog group Democracy 21, which has asked the Justice Department to investigate. “And that is precisely what the federal office holders who are running for president now feel free to do.” Back to the Future First Amendment champions blame McCain-Feingold for weakening the political parties, and applaud Citizens United for enhancing competition. Party leaders, too, have chafed at the soft-money ban. That helps explain why, in a rare show of bipartisanship, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada and GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tucked a measure that blew the lid off party fundraising limits into last year’s omnibus spending deal. But Democrats have collected barely $800,000 for their new special party accounts, while Republicans pulled in a cool $12 million for them in the first six months of this year. “It’s long been true that Democrats raise more money from low-dollar donors and the grass roots, and the GOP relies on wealthy millionaires and billionaires like the Kochs,” said Justin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “I’ve seen nothing that shows that’s going to change any time soon.” Party officials won’t say how they are filling these new coffers. But public records show that Republicans, at least, are relying in part on GOP leaders to solicit the money. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and his top two lieutenants — Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana — have collectively raised $7.3 million in the first quarter of this year for their respective joint fundraising committees from CEOs, lobbyists and financiers. Some of the money going into those joint committees, which divvy up their receipts between multiple accounts, has gone to the new political party funds. “We don’t know enough yet about how the parties are raising money for these new accounts,” said Trevor Potter, a former Federal Election Commission chairman and general counsel to the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “But people don’t just sit down and say: ‘Gosh, I think I’ve got to write a check to the convention account today.’ So who is asking for what? What is being promised? What are people gaining for giving this?” Super Solicitations Super PAC solicitations raise even bigger questions, said Potter, whose institute is also asking the Justice Department to investigate. Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican and White House hopeful, ostensibly did not ask his pal Norman Braman, the billionaire car dealer, for more than $5,000. But Braman is expected to give as much as $10 million to the super PAC backing Rubio, known as Conservative Solutions. Likewise Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, another White House aspirant, has made no bones about meeting with donors eager to underwrite a network of four super PACs backing him with variations on the name Keep the Promise. The PACs are said to have received as much as $31 million from hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer, already a Cruz campaign donor. All told they’ve pulled in $37 million. “We feel very confident that we are operating within the law and what we are allowed to do,” said Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier. comments powered by Disqus Tweet © Reprints Email If unfettered campaign spending has rendered contribution limits all but meaningless, conservatives say the solution is to simply eliminate them. “Our view is that they should take the contribution limits off altogether, and the candidates should be able to ask for money for their own campaigns,” said David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics. “That’s publicly reported, they’re responsible for the messaging in the campaign and also being identified with the donors directly.” Advocates of campaign restrictions have countered with a long list of bills that have gone nowhere on Capitol Hill. Feingold, who lost his 2010 re-election bid to Republican Ron Johnson but is seeking a rematch, all but admits the law he co-authored with McCain is no longer working. “People tell me all the time that our politics in Washington are broken and that multimillionaires and big corporations are calling all the shots,” Feingold said in May as he announced his candidacy. “They say this especially about the U.S. Senate, and it’s hard not to agree.” comments powered by Disqus",

The other day Chris Brown had a few words for his baby mama Nia’s mom amid news outlets confirming he will indeed take Royalty’s mom to court so a judge can make sense out of their child support drama, and he’s claiming the issue is Nia is asking for $15,000 a month. However, Nia’s camp tells TMZ that the real reason Chris filed the paperwork is because he’s mad his mother got to spend a day with Royalty on his watch, without his say so. TMZ writes: Sources close to Nia tell TMZ … Royalty’s parents finally came to an agreement on child support … settling on $10k per month from CB, starting July 1. As we reported, Chris’ camp said Nia initially wanted $15k, but he only wanted to pay $2,500. We’re told the new deal blew up though, when Daddy wanted Royalty this week — but she was already hanging with grandma in Virginia. Since relations between Chris and his mom have been bad for years now … our sources say Chris got pissed. We’re told Nia’s claiming this is the first time she’s ever denied Chris visitation, but looks like once was enough.",

Television pictures showed scenes of devastation, with hundreds of blood-spattered sandals lying at the factory gate.Ambia Begum, 50, who had come to collect charity, alleged that workers of businessman's factory had swooped on them with batons.\"They beat us up severely,\" The Daily Star quoted Ambia as saying. The doctors at the hospital said that the death toll could rise as many are critically injured.The reason of deaths was suffocation and stampede, they said. Police have detained eight people, including Shamim.A three-member investigation team has been formed in this connection and asked to report on the findings within three days.President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Speaker of the parliament Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury expressed their sympathy to the victims' family members.During Ramzan, it is mandatory for Muslims to donate money, food and clothes to the poor as charity.Around 40 people were killed in a similar stampede at a garment factory in the northern city Tangail in 2002.",

Michelle Obama on Thursday told hundreds of Native American youth that they are all precious and sacred and that each of you was put on this earth for a reason. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Michelle Obama on Thursday told hundreds of Native American youths that they are all precious and sacred and that “each of you was put on this earth for a reason.” “Each of you has something that you’re destined to do, whether that’s raising a beautiful family, whether that’s succeeding in a profession or leading your community into a better future,” the first lady said in a sometimes emotional address at a first-time summit called by the White House. “You all have a role to play and we need you.” The event was part of Generation Indigenous, or Gen-I, a White House initiative that grew from President Obama and Mrs. Obama’s visit last year to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the border between North Dakota and South Dakota. Meetings followed, Cabinet members held listening tours, and tribal youth were chosen as ambassadors and a national network was formed. The goal is to remove barriers that keep young people from reaching their potential. Teenagers at the summit represented 230 tribes and 42 states. Discussions focused on economic opportunity, education and cultural and other issues. From New Mexico’s pueblos to Midwest reservations, nearly one-third of American Indian youths live in poverty, according to federal statistics. They have the highest suicide rates of any ethnicity in the U.S., as well as the lowest high school graduation rates. Mrs. Obama recalled hearing “heart-wrenching stories” of substance abuse and other crises during last year’s visit but said the storytellers were looking to the future, not giving up. She urged the young people to “draw strength” from knowing that their customs, values and discoveries are “at the heart of the American story” and have shaped U.S. history for centuries. “Everyone in this room has your back,” she said. “Everyone who is speaking at this summit, all those Cabinet secretaries, all those powerful people who have come here for you, they have your back,” Mrs. Obama said. “And you definitely have a president and first lady who have your back.” She also counseled the young people to connect with and “be inspired by each other,” and to find out what issues others are working on and to take ideas home with them. “Run for office. Local office, state office, even president of the United States,” Mrs. Obama said. “I know you all have it in you.” Participants came up with ideas to address problems in their communities. Miguel Wambli, 16, of Rapid City, S.D., and a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, created a newspaper to feature writing by Native American students. Seven suicides by teenagers in recent months have shaken the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, and close to 1,000 suicide attempts were recorded on the reservation over nearly 10 years. Some students have projects aimed at raising awareness, while Wambli believes a newspaper would give teenagers an outlet. “I want to try just to help them find their voice and be able to express themselves and be knowledgeable about what’s going on in their community,” he said.",

And if you're Owatonna-bred Adam Young, the force behind Owl City, you might need some extra hugs from those 10,000 lightning bugs, because initial appraisals of Mobile Orchestra are, well, brutal. In its two-star review, the Guardian says Young \"makes music so bland and textureless that it should carry a health warning.\" Young writes \"lyrics that could make a motivational speaker seem suicidally depressed,\" says the New York Daily News in its two-star review. Stereogum really goes for the jugular with its post titled \"10 Worst Crimes Against Music On Owl City’s New Album.\" Among them: \"Every track is the sonic equivalent of a frozen dinner\" and \"Adam Young’s voice is butt.\" USA Today (\"Album of the Week\") and the A.V. Club (C+ review) provided the kindest mainstream takes. With a 51 out of 100 lifetime score score, the cloying, self-infantilizing electro-pop star behind megahits \"Fireflies\" and \"Good Time\" is one of the worst-reviewed artists in Metacric history — we're talking Nickelback/Ashlee Simpson/Hoobastank/Ja Rule territory. His branding, earnest or otherwise, has not shielded him from critical scorn. Looking past the bashful choirboy persona, it's easy to detect more than a little pandering in the Owl City formula, one that's being marketed with demographic-specific precision via three new singles. The club-y, Aloe Blacc-featuring \"Verge\" is Hallmark-transparent in its attempt to bilk the download bucks of young graduates; \"My Everything\" is Christian praise music that's sure to become a playlist favorite of church youth groups; and \"Unbelievable,\" featuring '90s throwback act Hanson, is effectively a nostalgia-baiting BuzzFeed listicle set to song. Adam Young's perceived naivete makes honest reviewing feel like bullying. Nobody — save perhaps Bart Simpson — gets joy out of smacking down Rod and Todd Flanders. At the same time, Rod and Todd Flanders aren't putting unforgivable songs like \"Unbelievable\" into the marketplace and banking off of them. There is a crass, calculated careerism to Young, whom we — especially in local media — often forget is a grown-ass, 29-year-old man. In creating \"Good Time,\" for example, this dude straight-face birthed the same condescending pop opiate satirized in Lego Movie with \"Everything Is Awesome,\" zero smirks involved. That's show biz, sure, but Top 40 appeal and tasteful artistry are by no means mutually exclusive. It's standard practice in arts journalism to not bag on the little guy, to avoid savaging questionable artists of minimal consequence just to appease your own critical blood lust. Adam Young may have a song written from the perspective of a honeybee, but he is not the little guy. He is the bankable pop star who's taking the heat he deserves.",

    "DiffbotBody": "THUMBS DOWN to the county for its spurious motions in this Tom Manning business. Manning filed a breach of contract and wrongful termination suit against the county in April, alleging that he was fired from his finance director job for refusing to violate state finance laws. He has since moved on to live in South Carolina. Yet the county filed a motion to dismiss Manning’s federal lawsuit on grounds that Manning doesn’t truly live in Charleston, S.C., in a silly, non-starting move. Manning’s out-of-state residence led to the lawsuit being filed in federal court rather than a North Carolina county’s Superior Court. Manning has lived in South Carolina for months and has stated he has no intention moving back. Let’s get on with the suit and stop this obfuscating. THUMBS DOWN to the secrecy the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts has employed to keep the public from knowing which magistrates around the state don’t want to do the job they were hired to do. Yes, the laws surrounding same-sex marriage were not in effect when the magistrates signed on, but they swore to uphold the law. All of the law. Names of those magistrates who have “recused themselves” from performing civil marriages are not being released, officials citing personnel records as the reason. Even more puzzling, the state won’t release the counties where magistrates have recused themselves. Highly questionable. THUMBS UP to Camp Greenleaves. Back in 1967, Evelyn Apple and then-recreation director Joe Davidson founded the camp after discussing the need for a summer outing program for developmentally disabled youngsters in the area. We were pleased to run a story and photo this week about this wonderful summer program that continues almost 50 years later, with the same energy and success. On that topic, THUMBS UP to OE Enterprises and the local library system. OE, which stands for “opportunity for everyone,” works with older adults and hires individuals within the disabled community to fulfill jobs while gaining job and community skills. If they are no longer able to work or don’t want to work, the clients are able to spend their time in the regular activity program provided by local libraries, doing such things as day trips, going out to eat, playing bingo, offering cooking demonstrations and crafts, among other items. It’s a positive experience for people who might not otherwise get the attention they deserve. THUMBS UP to the Alamance County Area Chamber of Commerce for organizing the 14th Annual Classroom Collection Campaign for Alamance County, which began Friday. This campaign collects school supplies for local families who may not be able to afford their own, especially things like book bags and calculators. The drive will take place from July 10 to Aug. 10 with drop boxes at eight locations in Alamance County. Cash donations will also be accepted through the Chamber of Commerce.",

The petition, started by Ryan Koch of Des Moines, Iowa, asks “us European Americans” to protest Cracker Barrel because it claims the restaurant known for its savory southern cuisine and country store “uses an offensive slur” and “is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage.” “The name is offensive,” the petition which currently has nearly 8,000 signers says. Koch says he started the satirical petition in response to “media reports of various groups and organizations constantly wanting to change things throughout the country because they claim they are offended.” He says the petition was meant to shed light on what he sees as political correctness in America. Koch feels there are more important issues the media should focus on such as crime, unemployment, veteran suicide, and corruption in politics. To be clear, Koch says the petition “is strictly for satirical and comedic purposes\" and “to show how ridiculous political correctness is getting in America.” Why is there a petition for Cracker Barrel to change their name because white people are offended. I'm literally screaming.— C. Lauren (@CarleyIauren_) July 10, 2015. Cracker Barrel responded to our request for comment on the petition with this statement: \"Cracker Barrel is aware of this satirical petition and recognizes that individuals have the right to express their opinion on all types of things. At Cracker Barrel, our mission is Pleasing People. While we respect the opinions of these individuals, our brand is well-known as a home away from home so we have no plans to change our name as it is synonymous with great food and great service.\"",

Oh, and of course, when David reminded his son, Brooklyn, that he has more Instagram followers than him, lawlz. And we can’t forget about the time when he taught Harper to ride a bike. . . so much cuteness. Though David might have been a superb soccer player, we think he was born to be a dad, too. Well now, be prepared to be hit in the feels once again. David took to Instagram not once, but twice today to post tributes to his sweet little Harper on her fourth birthday. First, he posted the most lovely picture of David holding her as a newborn. “Possibly my favourite picture of Harper of all time,” he wrote in the caption. “4 beautiful years with the most amazing little girl. . . Happy birthday big girl.” Yep, direct blow to the feels. But that’s not all, because hey, it’s the Beckhams we’re talking about. It looks like Harper had a fabulous b-day party complete with super adorable polka-dotted party hats, because David posted a picture of the two of them sporting said hats (as well as Harper’s babydoll — d’aw). “Sweet dreams my little 4 year old,” he wrote. “I think Harper Seven has had a fun packed day with her little friends. . . Good night little lady.” Please, Beckham family. You gotta stop being so adorable. There’s only so much our emotions can take. We can’t believe it’s been a full four years since Harper was born! Oh, how time flies. Happy birthday Harper, and we hope you had the BEST day — though it looks like your daddy made sure you did! (Images via Instagram)",

The thing is, we’re making this particular dilemma worse all the time, because we’re creating and capturing more raw data than ever before. A study in 2013 found that 90 percent of all the data in the world had been generated in the preceding two years alone, creating huge logistical challenges for those whose job it is to make sure that this tidal wave of information is properly preserved for current and future purposes. So who’s the biggest culprit when it comes to generating untold amounts of data? If you guessed YouTube, you’re right. With people uploading some 300 hours of video to the service every single minute, it generates about 100 petabytes of data per year (ie. 100,000 terabytes, if that helps). Luckily, Google’s not exactly short of a buck, so it’s presumably got the resources to deal with the flood. But data generators in other areas might not be so well prepared. A new study by researchers at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the US says that the field of genomics is the fastest-growing data generator in the world today, with the quantity of genetic data being produced on a daily basis doubling every seven months at the current rate. The research, published in PLOS Biology, suggests that by 2025, genome scientists will be way ahead of YouTube and Twitter, and also the current reigning data kings in science: astronomy and physics. In 10 years’ time, genetics researchers will be producing somewhere between 2 and 40 exabytes of data every year, depending on how the rate of doubling pans out.

Indications are that this is about to change, with expectations that as many as 1 billion people will have their full genomes sequenced over the course of the next decade, mostly in rich countries. While the medical benefits posed by genome research are expected to offer some amazing health solutions within that timeframe, it sounds like the problems for the data scientists are just beginning. “Genomics is a game-changing science in so many ways,” said Schatz. “My colleagues and I are saying that it’s important to think about the future so that we are ready for it.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "A team of researchers from MIT have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code. It turns out software and fruit have something in common: they both can rot. But while a banana that’s been sitting out too long can’t turn fresh again, old software code that no longer functions like it once did can be revitalized. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the university’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code, MIT said this week. This is a big deal for companies that might spend thousands of dollars on developers to restore old software that may not work as efficiently as it once did. Often times software programs written several years ago no longer function properly on the latest computers and hardware, explained MIT Professor Saman Amarasinghe in an interview with Fortune. The reason is because software has to be tailored to work for computers. Each time hardware technology advances and the performance of machines increases, a software program needs to get rejiggered to accommodate the changes. Typically, coders spend a lot of hours going through the program’s software to make changes, add more lines of code, and add algorithms that ensure that the software works efficiently with the hardware specs of the day. However, each time a programmer tweaks the software and adds new code, the program steadily becomes more bloated. Additionally, the algorithms and extra code used to match the software to current hardware specifications can often become invalidated as the next-generation gear launches into the market. Coders can have a difficult time removing all the extras, which leads to a program that experiences what is known as software rot. Once the code is rotten, the program as a whole can be slow as molasses and even unresponsive when you try to get it up and running. This is where the MIT researchers come in. The MIT team developed a software system called Helium that basically scans the rotten software, discovers the most crucial lines of code that the original programmers developed to make it function, and then builds a revised version of the program that works with the hardware specs that the MIT team wants it to match. What used to be a month’s long process, the MIT researchers claim can now be cut down to an hour. Amarasinghe explained that MIT tested out its Helium system with some engineers from Adobe ADBE -0.57% who were looking for ways to make the over-two-decade-old Photoshop program run faster and process images more quickly with the advancements in modern hardware tech. Whereas Google and Facebook have been running software that might be as young as three years, Adobe and other companies might have programs or applications that haven’t aged too well as the years have gone by, Amarasinghe said. In this case, the Adobe engineers wanted a way to make Photoshop run better without having to spend the traditional man-power needed to do the job. MIT claims that when they used Helium to revise Photoshop, the program’s performance increased by 75 percent. Say goodbye to the slow loading times for your favorite vacation pictures you want to make more colorful. As of now, Helium is not quite ready for primetime and it could be a few more years before it’s ready for widespread use, Amarasinghe said. Adobe was only testing out Helium and is not going to be using it in its products as of now. Also, while Helium can restore older code, it currently only works on image-processing software like Photoshop, because getting a program to display an image is a relatively easier task compared to other more complex software, he said. Still, if Helium pans out, Amarasinghe said it could have a lot of benefits to businesses. The healthcare industry, for example could save a lot of time having to upgrade their image-processing software for medical devices like X-ray machines as the hardware advances.

    "LabBody": "Water from a public hydrant that Tom Selleck has been accused of stealing from in dry California was legally purchased, an official said. The Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County sued the Magnum, P.I. star, alleging that a tanker truck filled up at the hydrant and took it to Selleck's 60-acre ranch more than a dozen times in the past two years. The district announced a tentative settlement with Selleck on Thursday. Jay Spurgin, public works director for Thousand Oaks, said a construction company paid a fee to secure the rights to draw water from the city hydrant two years ago. About 1.4 million gallons of water were taken from the hydrant during that period. \"There was water used during that time, and it was paid for,\" he said. Construction firms and contractors can obtain special meters that allow them to haul water from hydrants for large projects. Companies can draw as much water as they need or sell it to a third party as long as they pay the monthly service charge and water bill, Spurgin said. The water meter in question was removed in June. It's unclear if Selleck or his employees bought the water from the company or another source. A representative for Selleck didn't immediately return a request for comment on Friday. The water district said it spent nearly $22,000 US for a private detective to investigate. District officials declined to provide details of the tentative settlement, which has to be approved by the water board next week. California is grappling with a persistent drought, and the community where Selleck has his land is under mandatory cutbacks as high as 36 per cent.",

(MICHAEL PATRICK/NEWS SENTINEL) Maryville lawyer Kevin Shepherd said that by filing a class-action lawsuit Friday, his clients hope to advocate for the 5,000 residents evacuated from their homes during the July 2 CSX train derailment in Blount County. Shepherd’s office filed the lawsuit at 3:10 p.m. Friday in the circuit court for Blount County, with married couple Kelli and Aaron Johnson listed as plaintiffs. Shepherd said the Johnsons, whom he knew personally before acting as their lawyer, have two children younger than 2 and live within the 2-mile radius evacuated during the derailment, though not in the area immediately affected by the spill of the chemical acrylonitrile the derailed tanker was carrying. Shepherd said the Johnsons, who were not available for comment Friday, had no personal medical injuries that they were aware of. He expects individual suits to be filed by people who were hospitalized, he said, and hopes for “long-range medical monitoring” of potential health effects from the chemical. He also noted CSX is compensating residents for business loss and expenses associated with evacuation. Continue reading at the Knoxville News Sentinel. comments powered by Disqus",

Or perhaps you’ve only heard about him, or read about him in Rolling Stone a few years back. He’s larger than life – a superhero Orlando can call its own. Master Legend, who grew up in New Orleans, says he started on the path to superhero in second grade, when he learned to fight off bullies. “I was a badly abused and starved kid,” he says. “Most of the kids did not like me, and I only fit in with fellow abused kids that got it at school and at home.” One day, he says, he came across some comics in a trashcan, and though he says he couldn’t read all the words, he realized that becoming a superhero was his calling. “I made myself a mask and a shirt with an emblem on it, and the superhero was born,” he says. “I finally felt alive. I felt like I had a purpose, and it was to help others.” And that’s exactly what Master Legend does. He was commended in 2004 by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office for assisting people in need during the aftermath of Hurricane Charley, and today he spends a lot of his time (when he’s not working at his mild-mannered day job) giving away food, toiletries and other necessities to homeless individuals and “tearing down the walls of greed.” When asked what the best thing about being a superhero is, Master Legend simply says: “I get to be me.” When asked to tell us what he thinks is the best thing about Orlando, he says: “The real, honest, hardworking people out there. Without them, Orlando could not exist.” We couldn’t agree more. Best of Orlando 2014 was written by Lauren Ball, Ashley Belanger, Stephanie Garcia, Holly V.

    "DiffbotBody": "The gnats and mosquitos were out in force that mid-June evening at our campsite, as was the Indian paintbrush, the penstemon, globe mallow and other wildflowers whose names I don’t know. The long day’s last light slowly ran its fingers down the sinewy sandstone wave of Comb Ridge to the east, but the June heat persisted. My family and I had just spent several days in the canyons of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, an area that is mostly new to me. Now we were on Cedar Mesa, a place in which I spent a good deal of my youth, and which is now one of the battlefields in the war over what should be done with federal lands in the West. We could see the La Plata Mountains, our “home” range, as well as Lone Cone and Mt. Wilson up by Telluride, a fact that amazed my two daughters. Then they started arguing, because they’re teenagers, about how long it would take to walk back to Durango: A week? Two? And they marveled at how small the world of the Ancestral Puebloans must have been, maybe never leaving this mesa during a lifetime. Actually, I said, their world probably extended at least as far as our view. Out there, just beyond that dark nub known as Shiprock, lies Chaco Canyon. And up here on Cedar Mesa, there are several Chaco “outliers” — pueblos that were linked, by architecture, maybe even Chacoan “roads,” with the massive Great Houses in Chaco Canyon. It would only take a handful of signal fires atop strategically located stone towers to send a quick message from Chaco to here. And Puebloan ultra-runners surely could make the trip on foot in two days. My family retreated behind the bug screen of the tent, but I stayed out in the swarm, sitting cross-legged on a rock, sipping the dregs of a box of wine and watching Earth’s shadow spread across mesa, canyon and the sage plains. The silence was remarkable, interrupted only by the occasional boom of a nighthawk. As stars and lights flickered on in the sky and on the distant landscape, this hardly seemed like a place that’s being “loved to death,” nor one that was in need of protection from industrial invasion. But it is arguably both. For me — and many others — this is personal. My father became aware of Cedar Mesa back when he was growing up in Dolores, Colorado, not far to the east. After that, he came here often, seeking solitude or solace, archaeological sites or hidden pools amongst stone and sage, bringing his family along. As such, it became an important part of my individual creation myth: My earliest memories are of running around on slickrock with my brother, of the smell of piñon burning in the campfire, of seemingly brutal hikes to cliff dwellings nestled high up in a canyon wall. Later, my friends and I headed to Cedar Mesa whenever we got a chance, backpacking into the canyons that didn’t make it into the guidebooks, sometimes getting into trouble in the process — the fodder of stories we still tell today. The area lacked the drama of Canyonlands, but that made it more special. My father was a writer, and Cedar Mesa was often his subject. But he always adhered to an ethic of secrecy, never revealing precisely where it is he wrote about. To do so exposes hidden places, while also robbing folks of the joy of discovery. That ethic has long since perished, killed by Google and blogs, YouTube and Facebook. GPS coordinates of Ancestral Puebloan sites can be found with the flick of a mouse, drawing looters and potsherd-hunters, alike. Websites give precise directions to and detailed descriptions of those canyons that were once blank spots on the guidebooks’ maps, turning even short segments of slots into playgrounds for “canyoneers.” Archaeological sites that were largely ignored for years are now written up by travel writers from the LA Times and other national media. ATV trails have been cut where once were only walking paths. And a designated tar sands area lies under spectacular canyons a couple dozen miles west of where I sat. Environmentalists, historic preservationists and Native American groups have long fought to preserve what’s left, with efforts reaching a crescendo over the last couple of years. Friends of Cedar Mesa, Utah Diné Bikéyah, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and others recently joined up as the Bears Ears Coalition. (The Bears Ears are two buttes that overlook Cedar Mesa and a regional landmark). They’ve proposed putting a huge swath of land, stretching from the San Juan River in the south, encompassing the Abajo Mountains to the north, and reaching almost to Lake Powell in the west, into a national conservation area, with various areas within protected as Wilderness. Under the Diné Bikéyah proposal — which has the support of the Navajo Nation government — the southern portion would be co-managed by the tribe and the feds, in a way similar to Cañon de Chelly in Arizona. Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Rob Bishop’s Public Lands Initiative is attempting to meld the above vision with those of motorized vehicle advocates and state- and county-rights ideologues. Cedar Mesa and surrounding federal lands are in San Juan County, Utah, which has historically resisted federal land agencies. It was the site, last spring, of the Recapture Canyon ATV protest, led by county commissioner Phil Lyman who was recently convicted of federal misdemeanors for the protest. To counter the Bears Ears Coalition, the San Juan Alliance — an ad hoc local group that is decidedly opposed to federal control of their backyard — proposed turning over all BLM and National Park Service land to the state and to the county (e.g. “Canyonlands State Park”). The same week that I sat on Cedar Mesa and contemplated the landscape in question, the San Juan County Lands Council, which includes Lyman and representatives from the Bears Ears Coalition, sent off its compromise proposal to Bishop. While its protections are not nearly as widespread or as robust as those proposed by the Bears Ears Coalition, it does include about a half-million acres of wilderness and was enough to anger the anti-federal land folks. “This will negatively affect the San Juan County cattle and recreation industries and give the federal government even more control over this county,” wrote Monte Wells — who was convicted along with Lyman — on his ThePetroglyph.com Facebook page. “If the county doesn't oppose this entire bill we should thank them and the state for failing to protect our God-given individual rights.” That any of these proposals will be adopted as written is unlikely. But they will surely be used as guides for Bishop and others in congress as they craft Wilderness and other land bills, and by the Obama administration as it considers using executive order to create a national monument here. Less certain is what impact any such designation might have. The abuse of the past — huge swaths of forest “chained” in a futile attempt to create grazing areas, countless roads built to access uranium mines, off-road-vehicle trails spiderwebbing through delicate ecosystems, decades of cattle grazing and pot hunting — can’t be reversed. Meanwhile, monument or wilderness designation will just draw more attention, and visitors, potentially exacerbating the “loved to death” phenomenon. As Earth’s shadow spread across the land that night, I left my perch on the rock and headed toward the tent, ambivalent about these efforts to protect this place. But that ambivalence vanished when I noticed an odd silhouette protruding unnaturally above the shadows of the forest. It was an exploratory oil drilling rig, on the other side of the canyon, on land abutting a Wilderness Study Area. Jonathan Thompson is a senior editor of High Country News.",
    "LabBody": "The gnats and mosquitos were out in force that mid-June evening at our campsite, as was the Indian paintbrush, the penstemon, globe mallow and other wildflowers whose names I don’t know. The long day’s last light slowly ran its fingers down the sinewy sandstone wave of Comb Ridge to the east, but the June heat persisted. My family and I had just spent several days in the canyons of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, an area that is mostly new to me. Now we were on Cedar Mesa, a place in which I spent a good deal of my youth, and which is now one of the battlefields in the war over what should be done with federal lands in the West. We could see the La Plata Mountains, our “home” range, as well as Lone Cone and Mt. Wilson up by Telluride, a fact that amazed my two daughters. Then they started arguing, because they’re teenagers, about how long it would take to walk back to Durango: A week? Two? And they marveled at how small the world of the Ancestral Puebloans must have been, maybe never leaving this mesa during a lifetime. Actually, I said, their world probably extended at least as far as our view. Out there, just beyond that dark nub known as Shiprock, lies Chaco Canyon. And up here on Cedar Mesa, there are several Chaco “outliers” — pueblos that were linked, by architecture, maybe even Chacoan “roads,” with the massive Great Houses in Chaco Canyon. It would only take a handful of signal fires atop strategically located stone towers to send a quick message from Chaco to here. And Puebloan ultra-runners surely could make the trip on foot in two days. My family retreated behind the bug screen of the tent, but I stayed out in the swarm, sitting cross-legged on a rock, sipping the dregs of a box of wine and watching Earth’s shadow spread across mesa, canyon and the sage plains. The silence was remarkable, interrupted only by the occasional boom of a nighthawk. As stars and lights flickered on in the sky and on the distant landscape, this hardly seemed like a place that’s being “loved to death,” nor one that was in need of protection from industrial invasion. But it is arguably both. For me — and many others — this is personal. My father became aware of Cedar Mesa back when he was growing up in Dolores, Colorado, not far to the east. After that, he came here often, seeking solitude or solace, archaeological sites or hidden pools amongst stone and sage, bringing his family along. As such, it became an important part of my individual creation myth: My earliest memories are of running around on slickrock with my brother, of the smell of piñon burning in the campfire, of seemingly brutal hikes to cliff dwellings nestled high up in a canyon wall. Later, my friends and I headed to Cedar Mesa whenever we got a chance, backpacking into the canyons that didn’t make it into the guidebooks, sometimes getting into trouble in the process — the fodder of stories we still tell today. The area lacked the drama of Canyonlands, but that made it more special. My father was a writer, and Cedar Mesa was often his subject. But he always adhered to an ethic of secrecy, never revealing precisely where it is he wrote about. To do so exposes hidden places, while also robbing folks of the joy of discovery. That ethic has long since perished, killed by Google and blogs, YouTube and Facebook. GPS coordinates of Ancestral Puebloan sites can be found with the flick of a mouse, drawing looters and potsherd-hunters, alike. Websites give precise directions to and detailed descriptions of those canyons that were once blank spots on the guidebooks’ maps, turning even short segments of slots into playgrounds for “canyoneers.” Archaeological sites that were largely ignored for years are now written up by travel writers from the LA Times and other national media. ATV trails have been cut where once were only walking paths. And a designated tar sands area lies under spectacular canyons a couple dozen miles west of where I sat. Environmentalists, historic preservationists and Native American groups have long fought to preserve what’s left, with efforts reaching a crescendo over the last couple of years. Friends of Cedar Mesa, Utah Diné Bikéyah, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and others recently joined up as the Bears Ears Coalition. (The Bears Ears are two buttes that overlook Cedar Mesa and a regional landmark). They’ve proposed putting a huge swath of land, stretching from the San Juan River in the south, encompassing the Abajo Mountains to the north, and reaching almost to Lake Powell in the west, into a national conservation area, with various areas within protected as Wilderness. Under the Diné Bikéyah proposal — which has the support of the Navajo Nation government — the southern portion would be co-managed by the tribe and the feds, in a way similar to Cañon de Chelly in Arizona. Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Rob Bishop’s Public Lands Initiative is attempting to meld the above vision with those of motorized vehicle advocates and state- and county-rights ideologues. Cedar Mesa and surrounding federal lands are in San Juan County, Utah, which has historically resisted federal land agencies. It was the site, last spring, of the Recapture Canyon ATV protest, led by county commissioner Phil Lyman who was recently convicted of federal misdemeanors for the protest. To counter the Bears Ears Coalition, the San Juan Alliance As Earth’s shadow spread across the land that night, I left my perch on the rock and headed toward the tent, ambivalent about these efforts to protect this place. But that ambivalence vanished when I noticed an odd silhouette protruding unnaturally above the shadows of the forest. It was an exploratory oil drilling rig, on the other side of the canyon, on land abutting a Wilderness Study Area. Jonathan Thompson is a senior editor of High Country News.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Update: iOS 9 beta is now available to download by the public. Here's how to install iOS 9 and what it's all about. iOS 9 is Apple's next iPhone and iPad update now that iOS 8.4 has launched with Apple Music, and it brings a smarter Siri, public transit directions to Maps, true tablet multitasking and new built-in apps. Unveiled on June 8, it's Apple's new big project between April's Apple Watch launch and September's expected iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus unveiling, and it's not just being tested by developers. An iOS 9 public beta has launched with improved stability, a smaller download size and legacy phone and tablet compatibility. That older iPhone and iPad you have will work with this update if it runs iOS 8. New iOS 9 features consist of redesigned built-in apps and a few premiers new ones. There's also more functionality than ever for iPads. Here's what to expect with the full release. iOS 9 release date iOS 9 is available to everyone enrolled in Apple's free public beta program or its iOS developer program. The latter launched first at WWDC, but requires becoming a registered developer by paying a yearly fee. Everyone else who wants the final version of iOS 9 for free has to wait until later this year when it's expected to launch with the new iPhone. Think: September. That two month wait can be a good thing. iOS 9 beta 1 and beta 2 were buggy and unfinished. The best features typically don't launch until the gold master version, anyway. iOS 9 compatibility iOS 9 is proving to be more inclusive than previous iOS versions. Apple is choosing to make this update compatible with older iPhone, iPad and even iPod touch devices, too. Okay, it's not technically more inclusive just yet. Basically, if your dated hardware runs iOS 8, it can run iOS 9. When the rumored iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPad Air 3 and iPad mini 4 launch, then the list will grow by four, or five if there's an iPhone 6C. Overall, it's good news, as older phones and tablets aren't getting muscled out. The iPhone 4S and iPad 2 are safe, for now, and a few 30-pin dock devices live on. Smarter Siri Siri in iOS 9 is getting the much-needed smarts to rival Google Now. Apple's personal assistant understands the word \"it\" within context and brings proactivity to the operating system. For example, if you're talking about a topic with someone in iMessages and ask Siri to \"Remind me about 'this' later today,\" it'll scan the open app and try to understand what \"this\" means. iOS 9 proactivity puts even more at your fingertips through Siri. It suggests appointments to add to Calendar, and pulls up photos based on location and time with the sound of your voice. Siri's location-based knowledge appears to be most promising when you're out and about. Plugging in headphones at the gym? It'll offer the Now Playing interface right on the lockscreen. Plugging it into your car? It'll bring up that audiobook you were listening to before. It'll even tell you when to leave for an appointment across town, a feature that has made Google's app for iOS a must-have. Siri in iOS 9 also knows your location and what you like to listen to in the car or gym One of the most convenient new iOS 9 features is giving context to random numbers that call you, diving into your email to see if it can match the digits. Goodbye, telemarketers - we hope. Siri already takes over one billion requests a week, according to Apple. That should only increase now that iOS 9 promises to make Siri 40% faster and 40% more accurate. Apple Pay expands Apple Pay has been touted as a success, but so far has been limited to the US. That all changes when the mobile payment platform launches in the UK this month. The official Apple Pay UK release date is rumored to be July 14, and it'll be backed by nearly 70% of credit and debit cards there, including Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and HSBC. Canada and China are thought to be next up for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus mobile payment platform, but the company hasn't announce that broad of an expansion just yet. In the US, Apple Pay is now backed by 2,500 US banks and, this fall, rewards and store-issued cards will be a part of the mobile wallet. This is an idea we liked about Android Pay at Google IO in May. Considering these newfound iOS 9 capabilities, Apple is renaming Passbook (the app where Apple Pay resides) to Wallet. Apple Maps Apple Maps is sometimes unavoidable, even if you're a dedicated Google Maps users. Siri and built-in apps still open directions up in the default navigation app. That won't change. The good news is that iOS 9 is going to make Apple Maps better, and maybe even tolerable. In its first major refresh since 2013, the app now includes long-awaited public transit directions. That means routes for buses, trains, subways and, yes, even ferries are part of Apple Maps. This goes live this fall in Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, New York City, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay Area, Toronto and Washington D.C. Notably, it'll support directions for 300 cities in China, a huge emerging market for the iPhone, including hotspots like Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai. Apple News apps In addition to getting rid of Passbook in favor of Wallet in iOS 9, Apple is replacing Newsstand with News, and it's very familiar if you're a fan of magazine-style news aggregators. Apple News for iOS 9 is Flipboard, HTC BlinkFeed and Feedly wrapped into one app. It features a personalized feed and is coming to US, UK and Australia at launch. No telling if publishers will wrap their content in the fresh Apple News format. The advantage to you, however, is more clear: your data will remain anonymous, apart from your Apple ID, promises the company. Multitasking for iPad iOS 9 brings true multitasking to its newer iPad tablets, and we're not talking about the \"multitasking\" app switcher that premiered with iOS 4 back in 2010. iPads will finally be able to handle more hefty productivity tasks. That's to the delight of enterprise users who prefer iOS for personal use, but feel forced to opt for a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 or Android tablet at work. There are three ways to view multitasking windows on an iPad. Slide Over brings a second app from the side so you can answer a text or write something in Notes. It's just as easy to slide away. There's also a special Picture-in-Picture mode that puts videos and FaceTime calls in the corner of the display when the home button is pressed. From there, you can use any other app while watching the video. Google's YouTube app for iOS works this very same way, at least within that specific app. Both Slide Over and Picture-in-Picture are compatible with newer iPads: iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3. The last mode, Split View, is an iPad Air 2-only affair. Split View is the mode that everyone imagines when they hear the word \"multitasking.\" It enables two apps to be open side-by-side and they're both active at the same time, with full multitouch support. While Apple isn't ready to announce the long-rumored 12-inch iPad Pro, it's clearing honing in on the enterprise user with its latest tablet software features. New iOS 9 keyboard Apple launched what it called its \"best keyboard yet\" with the iOS 8 QuickType, and it's trying to one-up that statement with the iOS 9 keyboard. iPad's on-screen keyboard now features a built-in shortcut bar, which flanks the next-word suggestions above the QWERTY letter keys. Cut, copy and paste to the left; bold, italic, underline and attachments to the right. That's better than having to hunt for these shortcuts in the second layer of the keyboard menu, and in a surprise move, Apple is making this default layout customizable and compatible with third-party keyboard apps. Cursor control is now easier with a handy (or fingery) slide mechanic when using two fingers. It basically turns the iPad QuickType keyboard into an trackpad. It's way easier than hovering over the tiny cursor, trying to land in between letters. Finally, shortcuts are coming to wireless keyboards so that you can interact with apps using their own built-in shortcut keys. Pressing and holding the Command, Option or Control key brings up the shortcut list. Under the hood New features are exciting and all, but iOS 9 needs to run better than iOS 8, which had a series of Wi-Fi and battery drain problems from the get-go. Some users are still complaining. Longer battery life is a chief concern of iPhone users, but they can squeeze out an extra hour thanks to a new Low Power mode. Apple says iOS 9 pulls switches you didn't even know existed to save juice. You may be able to install iOS 9 this time around without deleting all of your photos. It'll take about 1.3GB, whereas iOS 8 needed massive 4.5GB of internal storage. That was awful on a 16GB iPhone. CPU and GPU usage will be more efficient thanks to iOS 9, further improving performance, and security is said to be stepped up. Hopefully that means last year's iCloud hack isn't going to be an annual incident. Not mentioned during Apple WWDC keynote, a \"Move to iOS\" app is hidden within iOS 9. It'll be easier to wirelessly switch from an Android device to a new iOS phone or tablet. iPhone and iPad may be surprised when asked to enter a six-digit passcode instead of an easier-to-crack four digit code. But it's the difference between one million possible combinations and 10,000 and Touch ID really makes the hassle a moot point. Better safe than sorry. Apple's rather confident iOS 9 public beta is showing a lot of promise, even if it's an incremental update. Google's Android M is taking the same cautious approach. We'll see how they both turn out this fall. See more Operating systems news",
    "LabBody": "Update: Ready to download iOS 9? The release date is this month, and the public beta is now available. Here's how to how to install iOS 9 beta and what it's all about. Apple is readying iOS 9, due less than two weeks from today, and this iPhone and iPad update brings a smarter Siri, public transit directions to Maps, true tablet multitasking and new built-in apps.

There's more functionality than ever for iPads, and we may see some additional, unannounced Force Touch capabilities and motion wallpaper. Here's what to expect with the full release in mere days. iOS 9 release date. iOS 9 became available to everyone in July if they were enrolled in Apple's free public beta program and, before that, at WWDC, through its fee-required iOS developer program for true beta testers. Everyone else who wants the final, stable version of iOS 9 for free has to wait until \"later this year,\" according to Apple, when it's expected to launch with the new iPhone. Think: September. The iPhone 6S launch event date is Wednesday, September 9. In the past, iOS updates have typically launched the following Wednesday, which would be one week later, September 16, this time around. That two-week wait is a good thing. iOS 9 public beta versions have been a bit buggy and unfinished.

This is an idea we liked about Android Pay at Google IO in May. Considering these newfound iOS 9 capabilities, Apple is renaming Passbook (the app where Apple Pay resides) to Wallet. We'll see if it's enough to compete with the September 28 launch of Samsung Pay on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and its other new Android phones. Apple Maps. Apple Maps is sometimes unavoidable, even if you're a dedicated Google Maps user. Siri and built-in apps still open directions up in the default navigation app. That won't change.

Notably, it'll support directions for 300 cities in China, a huge emerging market for the iPhone, including hotspots like Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai. Just don't expect it much more than that to sway you from Google Maps or Waze. The design changes are minimal and, as we point out in our iOS 9 review, it clearly needs more work. Apple News apps. In addition to getting rid of Passbook in favor of Wallet in iOS 9, Apple is replacing Newsstand with News, and it's very familiar if you're a fan of magazine-style news aggregators. Apple News for iOS 9 is Flipboard, HTC BlinkFeed and Feedly wrapped into one app. It features a personalized feed and is coming to US, UK and Australia at launch. There's also Apple News integration outside of this app right on one of the home screens. Four or five snippets of news appear within the left-most menu, right below spotlight search, recent contacts and recent apps. In this way, Apple is mimicking Samsung's left-most Flipboard menu, with less pizzazz. No telling if all of your favorite publishers will wrap their content in the fresh Apple News format. The advantage to you, however, is more clear: your data will remain anonymous, apart from your Apple ID, according to the company.

Finally, shortcuts are coming to wireless keyboards so that you can interact with apps using their own built-in shortcut keys. Pressing and holding the Command, Option or Control key brings up the shortcut list. iOS 9 Wi-Fi problems fix. Apple has also worked out a solution for when your Wi-Fi connection is proving to be a massive pain. It's called Wi-Fi Assist, and it'll automatically drop your Wi-Fi connection and jump onto your mobile network whenever it's struggling. You can switch it off if you're on a limited data package but it's a great idea for those who have spotty Wi-Fi connections and get annoyed at having to manually control it. Under the hood.

PM @narendramodi meets PM Nawaz Sharif on sidelines of SCO Summit,\" tweeted ministry of external affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup.Modi and Sharif met informally and exchanged pleasantries on Thursday night at a dinner hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the BRICS-SCO summit delegates.India and Pakistan are set to be absorbed as full-fledged members of the China-led SCO on Friday.All issues, including terrorism and trade, are expected to be on the table during the around 30-minute talks.The constant firing on the border is likely to feature in the talks, especially as a BSF trooper was killed in cross-border firing.The release of 26/11 mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi is to be taken up too. India is expected to voice its concerns over Lakhvi's release by a Pakistani court.Ways of boosting cross-border trade are also likely to figure. Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Qazi Khalilullah had said in Islamabad on Thursday that the meeting between the two prime ministers is \"expected to have a positive impact on bilateral relations and regional and international levels\". Modi and Sharif met in November last year during the SAARC Summit in Kathmandu, but they did not hold any bilateral meeting.The two leaders had held a bilateral meeting on May 26 last year during the swearing-in of Modi.The meeting comes as both countries are set to be absorbed as permanent members into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation grouping.The US has welcomed the meeting between Modi and Sharif, saying the tension between the two South Asian neighbours is not in anyone's interest.\"We welcome the meeting between Indian and Pakistani leaders on the sidelines of this conference,\" State Department Spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday.\"We also welcome any steps that both countries can take to try to reduce the tensions. That's been our longstanding position,\" Kirby said.\"We want to see the tensions reduced, and we want to see these issues resolved bilaterally between the two countries. It's in nobody's interest for the tensions to rise and to increase, and for the tensions in the region to become less stable in many ways than they already are,\" he added.",

    "DiffbotBody": "When you hold on to your dream tightly and work hard, anything is possible. That’s what nine-year-old Daniel Cabrera has been teaching the world. But let’s back up. It all started a couple weeks ago on June 23rd, when Facebook user and college student Joyce Gilos Torrefranca uploaded two grainy pictures to Facebook. “I got inspired by a kid,” Joyce captioned the photos. Why was she inspired? Because her pictures featured a small child, who turned out to be Daniel, working on a school assignment. Good student, right? No, AMAZING student, because he was kneeling on a bench outside at night, working on his schoolwork by the light from the McDonald’s next door. Turns out that McDonald’s sidewalk is Daniel’s study nook. . . because he has nowhere else to go. ABS-CBN News found Daniel, who is in the third grade, at a nearby eatery in Cebu, Philippines, where his mother and sibling work. The family is homeless due to a house fire. Daniel’s father passed away in 2013, and one of Daniel’s three siblings is ill. Yet, Daniel is still 100% determined to study hard and fulfill his dream of being a policeman. “For me as a student, it just hit me a lot, like big time,” Joyce said, according to ABS-CBN News. “I seldom go to coffee shops to study. And then this kid, he doesn’t have anything but he has dedication to study.” Daniel’s mother, 42-year-old Christina, makes only 80 pesos a day at the store, according to Yahoo. That’s only $1.77 for a whole day’s work. She also sells cigarettes and candy on the streets of an urban center in the Central Philippines. Christina is not alone—approximately one-quarter of the Philippines’ population live on less than a dollar a day, and there are massive slums in every major city. According to Christina, working by the light of a McDonald’s is very characteristic of Daniel, as he is an incredibly hard worker. “He is a very studious and determined boy,” she explained to AFP. “He would insist on going to school even without his lunch money because I have no money to give. . . He always tells me: ‘Mama, I don’t want to stay poor. I want to reach my dreams’.” The Facebook post has been shared over 7,000 times, and Daniel’s story was shared on local television. Eventually, it spread over the world. Now, Daniel will most certainly be reaching his dreams after donations of money, school supplies, and even a college scholarship poured in. People have even given school clothes (and a reading lamp, so no more McDonald’s reading for him!). “We’re overjoyed. I don’t know what I will do with all of these blessings,” Christina told the AFP. “Now, Daniel will not have to suffer just to finish his studies.” The local government social welfare office and the church have also received financial aid after Daniel’s story went viral. “Our problem is how to manage all this financial assistance,” the city’s social welfare office chief, Violeta Cavada, told AFP. “[Daniel] has become a symbol of poor slum boys in the city who can’t study because they don’t have electricity.” This story made us cry happy and sad tears. We know that the smart, hard-working, and dedicated Daniel will achieve everything he’s ever dreamed of. We can’t wait until the day we see him defending and protecting the streets, decked out in his police uniform. It’s so beautiful to see people come together to make the world a better place, one family at a time. [Image via Facebook]",

In essence, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Snowden was right and our government was wrong. One of the parties lied to us, and it was not Edward Snowden. Remember, Edward Snowden exposed what our government was doing to us, and then the government went after him in the most vindictive manhunt since Taylor Swift started back dating. First, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said under oath before Congress that the government was not spying on us or collecting our phone call data: a lie. Then the government said it had the right to do it and continued doing so. Our courts just ruled otherwise. All the while, Barack Obama defended the spy program. He has gone from his self-described “most transparent administration in history,” to being the nutty ex-lover who stalks you on the Internet. Most Americans who are not paying attention to this really do not seem to care: “Oh well, I was not using my civil liberties anyway.” Men seem more upset than women about Internet and cell phone snooping; we have more browser history that we’d like to remain secret. Women don’t mind Obama’s surveillance. They think it’s nice to have a man listen to them. Both political parties defended the data gathering, since they were the ones gathering the data. They both called Edward Snowden a traitor. Loosely defined, a “whistleblower” is someone who hurts the other political party; a “traitor” is someone who hurts yours. As we now finally get to decide the limits of what of ours the government can access from us, a healthy mistrust of government must be foremost. I’d like to think our government would only use the data collected to protect us from terrorism, but the way this White House goes after its enemies makes Nixon look like a piker. The IRS was used to target political opponents, and then “lost” its emails when caught. Harry Reid stood on the Senate floor and knowingly lied about Mitt Romney not paying his taxes. A Fox News journalist was wiretapped. Most troubling, our Justice Department seems more intent on settling racial and political scores than on prosecuting criminals. Obama’s O-bots have a history of going after whistleblowers who defy him. He long ago ceded any moral high ground on this issue, and Democrats only care about maintaining power. If I were Snowden and heard buzzing overhead, I wouldn’t presume it to be cicadas. “Drone Ranger” Obama could be after another U.S. citizen abroad. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

Don’t believe the self-serving hype that the Feds prevent terrorism with their spying and the trillions of tax dollars they spend. We could not avert the Boston bombing even when Russia gave us a heads up. Nor did they know anything about the two Islamic terrorists who tried to kill the cartoonists in Texas. Local police did their job and shot the guys, with no help from the NSA. Don’t mess with Texas! At a minimum, what Edward Snowden did was throw a high and inside fastball to back the government off the plate and make it question what it is doing. He has done us a service. Hopefully, he makes the government rethink how it is trampling the Fourth Amendment and the Fourth Estate. This case might end up in the Supreme Court. Perhaps the NSA, DOJ, Obama’s White House and the IRS didn’t violate any laws in doing what they did to us, but even more troubling is that they did not have to. What Snowden did embarrassed and angered the political class. But a person does not go to jail for embarrassing our country. If so, Joe Biden would be serving a life term.

One of the most affordable ways to get rid of deep wrinkles around your mouth is to perform face-tightening exercises. The Genius Beauty website recommends standing in front of the mirror and performing facial exercises for 15 minutes every day to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Start by stretching your mouth as wide as you can, as if saying \"cheese.\" Hold the position for two seconds, then pucker your lips together tightly so that your lips almost touch your nose. Hold this pose for two seconds, then stretch your mouth back into the \"cheese\" position. After two seconds, stretch your lips forward and down, as if saying the word \"go.\" Hold for two seconds, then relax. Repeat the entire routine 20 times.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Check out McGregor's exclusive training camp workout and start training like a fighter now. THE WARMUP Dynamic Stretching Duration: 10-15 min. For the workout: Perform exercises 1A-1C as a circuit, then do the heavy bag and grappling.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Step 1 Get a healthy nutrition plan. Work with a dietitian to design a nutrition plan for you that focuses on improving your health and helping you to lose weight. Your nutrition plan should be low in saturated fat (usually animal fats), high in vegetables and fruits, contain lean meats and use healthy vegetable oils such as coconut, safflower, sunflower, olive, avocado and grapeseed oils when cooking. In addition to your meal plan being low in saturated fat, eat complex carbohydrates such as beans, lentils and sprouted grains for energy and fiber. Step 2 Exercise at least 60 minutes per day, which helps you lose and manage your weight. A weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight can help reduce visceral fat stores. The only way to reduce visceral fat stores is to burn more calories than you consume. Engage in physical activity such as circuit training, brisk walking, biking and any activity that gets your heart rate up and you moving for an hour. Step 3 Stay motivated. Weight loss takes time. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect to lose weight overnight because you didn\u0026rsquo;t gain it quickly. According to the JAMA, just a modest amount of weight loss will improve your visceral fat stores and other medical complications you have. Use that as motivation to stick with your eating and exercise program. Step 4 Stop practicing unhealthy lifestyle habits. Stop smoking, drinking, being inactive, and eating high-fat, processed foods. Choosing healthier lifestyle choices will improve your quality of life and will show up in inches lost as stated in the Guidelines for Overweight and Obesity.",
    "LabBody": "Visceral fat is stored around your internal organs in your stomach region. The problem with visceral fat is that too much around your organs can interfere with how your liver functions. This can lead to insulin resistance (the beginning of diabetes), high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and a higher risk for developing heart disease. Having a waistline greater than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women is a sign of large visceral fat stores, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). An increased waistline, high blood pressure, high triglycerides (fat in the blood), low HDL (\u0026quot;good\u0026quot; cholesterol) and rising blood sugar characterizes Syndrome X, which starts with high visceral fat stores. Lifestyle changes will help promote usage of visceral fat and lower your risk factors for developing heart disease. Step 1. Get a healthy nutrition plan.

In addition to tastings, gifts for sale by local artists, live music, food and tours will be part of the event. Tickets are $25 for both days, and are available at participating locations. When: Noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, June 20-21 Wineries: Participating wineries are in the Summit Road area between Santa Cruz and Los Gatos and include Burrell School, MJA Vineyards, Silver Mountain, Villa del Monte and Wrights Station. On Sunday, Muns Vineyard and Radonich Brothers Winery will be at The Summit Store. • At Burrell School, 24060 Summit Road, Los Gatos. Live music, hors d’oeuvres, open garden featuring heritage roses and special discounts on featured wines. Sip your wine on the deck overlooking the vineyard. • At MJA, 24900 Highland Way, Los Gatos. A festival of live music, local artists, and artisan pairing with a special flight, including a sneak peak of new releases for 2015. Enjoy this cabin in the woods. • At Silver Mountain, Silver Mountain Drive, Los Gatos. The Silver Mountain Art and Wine Festival with artists, artisan and food vendors, live music with the Silver Mountain Jazz Trio, a guest chef catering small plates, and extensive wine tasting list, tours of the organic vineyard and sustainable winery. • At Villa del Monte, 23076 Summit Road, Los Gatos Enjoy forest views, wine tasting, cheese pairing. • At Wrights Station, 24250 Loma Prieta Ave., Los Gatos. Mountain views from the patio; bocce ball; live music. • On Sunday at The Summit Store, 24197 Summit Rd., Los Gatos. Two wineries without tasting rooms offer their wines: nearby Muns Vineyard; and Radonich Brothers Winery from its vineyard and winery on Highland Way. When Ed Muns landed atop Loma Prieta, it wasn’t to grow grapes — that came later — he wanted the elevation to set up his ham radio antenna. At 2,600 feet, it was “awesome,” says the avid operator who has set world records with his prowess at ham radio contesting. It’s also awesome, he would discover, for growing pinot noir grapes that are sought after by top wineries in the region. Plenty of sun above the fog line, cool ocean breezes and sandy loam soils are the terroir for pinot noir. When Muns moved to the property — he broke ground for his house Oct. 17, 1989, the day of the Loma Prieta earthquake — the peak gained two feet in altitude, says Muns’ partner Mary Lindsay, adding to the 360 degree view of Mount Umunhum, the peak of Ridge Vineyard in the distance, Bonny Doon, Steamer Lane and the Monterey Peninsula. Muns Vineyard What: Ed Muns and Mary Lindsay grow 12 acres of pinot noir and an acre of syrah atop Loma Prieta. Winemaker Tony Craig makes the wine, and grapes are sold to area wineries as well. Tasting room: No tasting room. Wines served at events such as Los Gatos Plein Air Art and Wine, June 20; Silicon Valley Wine Auction, June 20; Solstice on the Summit, June 21. I make wines that are: ‘an expression of ridge-top vineyards, and that age,’ says Muns. Wines: Pinot noir, rose of pinot noir and syrah Family: Pinot the dog, a gopher getter Outside the winery: Muns enjoys sailing, ham radio, Himalayan cats and Jack Russell terriers. Lindsay also enjoys sailing, traveling, birding and collecting rocks. She has a public relations company and is event coordinator for Silver Mountain Vineyards. Muns and Lindsay met sailing Hobie Cats. Inspired by: Lindsay is inspired by the view from atop the mountain, while Muns is inspired by people appreciating the end result of growing grapes — wine. Winemaker selection: 2010 Muns Vineyard Pinot Noir, Santa Cruz Mountains Estate: Tasting notes: ‘The heady dark cherry of this pinot dances across your tongue and into your heart, along with Tahitian vanilla, cardamom and fresh-baked bread. The palate is full and lingers; and the mouth-feel is a sensory experience with smooth, velvety tannins. The tannins are balanced yet not overpowering from aging in Eastern European oak. It is fragrant with cherry, vanilla and sandalwood. Complex, balanced acidity and minerality typical of the Santa Cruz Mountains and our vineyard.’ $40. Recommends: Soquel Vineyards for its historic support of Muns Vineyard. Contact: www.munsvineyard.com, 408-515-2663 In the 1990s, Muns replanted an abandoned vineyard with a more suitable 12 acres of pinot and an acre of syrah. “The whole point of growing grapes is to make great wine,” says Muns, who along with Lindsay planted several acres by hand. “Everything we do in the vineyard is about making great wine, not just about growing tons (of grapes) to make money.” In addition to making their own Muns Vineyard wine, Muns and Lindsay sell grapes to Rexford Winery, Savannah Chanelle Vineyards, Thomas Fogarty, Sonnet Wine Cellars and more. “My feeling is, I want to grow the best wine grapes, no matter who makes it,” says Muns. “I want our name on other brands. It keeps the pressure on me to grow the best.” Some winemakers want grapes from certain areas, others at different ripeness stages. At Muns Vineyard, harvest is spread out, and when the grape customers are satisfied, Muns harvests his own for winemaker Tony Craig to craft. Muns sees himself as farmer first, well, farmer/engineer. Muns’ 32 years as an engineer and executive at Hewlett-Packard show up in the vineyard. Whether it’s fixing a broken tractor, designing irrigation hose to easily adjust water placement, or just getting a plant to do what you want it to do, Muns’ problem-solving skills and practical applications are brought to bear. “It’s engineering applied to day-to-day problems. Farmers historically are famous for fixing things themselves,” he says. “There’s a lot of science in agriculture, and it feeds that side of my nature.” Muns plants specific pinot noir clones to achieve complexity and add character to the resulting wine. Location in the vineyard and season also affect grapes. Lindsay describes the Muns Vineyard profile as deep black cherry flavors, soft tannins and an ability to age. Muns and Lindsay want to avoid wines that taste the same, year after year, preferring instead to vary with the growing season. “I want to do terroir wines. I want people to say, ‘This is a Muns wine,’ not weird but with distinction,” he says. Stacey Vreeken’s Wine Press column appears monthly. Contact her at staceyvreeken@gmail.com.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Ace Eicher wants to introduce you to her brother Archie, a boy who was once cast aside because he was born with Down syndrome. Archie started his life in Bulgaria, but through the tireless efforts of his new parents, would find a fresh life filled with love and support in the United States. Ace beautifully details out all the things that make Archie a great person, and how their bond will never be broken. The process to adopt Archie wasn't an easy one, but you can tell just how much it means to both children to have each other in their lives. Day to day they are inseparable, and share a care and a love for one another that I'd argue most siblings would be envious of. It pains my heart to know that boys like Archie are afterthoughts in some societies, but as long as there are people in the world like Ace and her parents, children with Down syndrome will have a chance to lead a happy life. Currently there are approximately 400,000 people in the United States with Down syndrome, which knows no race or socioeconomic background. We feel that Archie's story of finding love and acceptance needs to be heard, so spread little Ace's words to the world if you feel the same. Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",
    "LabBody": "Ace Eicher is a little girl with a very special message about her brother that she wants to share with the world. In a video uploaded to YouTube on March, 2012, Ace narrates the tale of her adopted brother Archie, a boy who was once cast aside because he was born with Down syndrome, but found a new life in the America. Her touching tribute has been viewed over 2.6 million times, which shows just how impactful her feelings towards Archie really are. Ace begins by explaining how Archie started his life in Bulgaria, but states that,\"When the doctor said he had Down syndrome, the mom said she couldn't keep him.\" After admitting to the camera that she didn't quite understand why Archie's first mother couldn't keep him, she shrugs the notion off by saying, \"but whatever, I'm just happy he's my brother.\" Archie's loving relationship with his sister was shared with the world in honor of World Down Syndrome Day, which this past March just celebrated its 10th anniversary. Currently there are approximately 400,000 people in the United States with Down syndrome, but Ace's hope is that by watching her video Archie will not be treated differently, because as she puts it, \"he's just like any other kid.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Huawei’s Honor 6 Plus was launched in 2014 Huawei has recently announced the Honor 7 flagship smartphone, which it officially introduced only in its home court China. But last year’s Honor 6 lineup, which includes two models, continues to be a viable alternative for those who don’t mind picking up a previous-generation model. Actually, the higher-end Honor 6 Plus remains quite relevant to this day because it still bundles good enough specs, which we will be detailing in what follows. The handset doesn’t sell in the US, but it’s available in Europe, where customers can pick it up for an affordable price. And as we will soon reveal in our review, Huawei's Honor 6 Plus is quite a good deal, and it would be a very good choice especially for those who are into smartphone photography. Design - iPhone-inspired look The Honor 6 Plus is the larger sibling of the Honor 6 flagship, coming with a spacious 5.5-inch display. The rising trend for device manufacturers as of late seems to be to release a base model and a Plus version as a combo. We’ve seen Apple doing it, and other device makers like Xiaomi have followed the same path. Looking at the Honor 6 Plus, you’ll quickly get a distinct iPhone vibe, as the device can be best described as an oversized version of the iPhone 4. As for materials used for its construction, the Honor 6 Plus employs a metal trim around the edge (the Honor 6 uses a plastic frame) and a glass black. The bottom of the phone features gentle curves that are quite reminiscent of the Sony Xperia Z3. Albeit being quite big, the Honor 6 Plus is pretty light, breaking the scales at 165 g and boasting a thickness of 7.5mm. However, you will need to use both hands to type on it properly, especially if you’re not endowed with a large grip. Due to the shiny surface, the phone can feel quite slippery at times, so be careful to always firmly hold it in hand. The volume rocker and power/standby button live on the upper right side, while a bit lower we have the dual SIM card slot. The top edge is home to the headphone jack, along with an IR blaster. There’s an odd configuration aspect here, in the sense that the second nanoSIM card slot also takes in the microSD card, for those who feel the need for extra storage on their phone. Display and camera performance - you’ll love snapping photographs The Huawei Honor 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display with 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution and 400 ppi pixel density. Huawei is a firm believer that QHD displays are useless and tend to unnecessarily suck out the battery life. So even with its latest P8 and Honor 7 flagships, the company has stuck with the 1080p standard. The Honor 6 Plus has the same size and resolution as the iPhone 6 Plus, so the two phones’ displays are pretty similar. Small text positioned beneath icons is pretty sharp and easy to read, and images look pretty sharp on the display. As for the camera department, this is one of the Honor 6 Plus’ strong points. On the back of the device live two 8MP cameras (a dual-camera setup): one is used to take regular shots, while the second adds some interesting depth of field effects and also lets you refocus an image after you’ve taken it. But while the images look great on the phone’s display, when you move the results onto your laptop and try to zoom on them, you’ll notice that there’s a lack of clarity. The camera setup performs quite decently in low-light environments, but without applying the Super night mode available in the camera app settings, the results prove to be quite grainy. Normally, you’ll be getting the best results in natural daylight environments, although sometime you can spot some barrel distortion. The dual camera setup can be used in concert with Wide-aperture mode, which lets users manually adjust the aperture from f/0.95 to f/16. To get the best results, you’d better make sure that the subject and background are well-defined. This creates nice imagery, as you can see for yourself in the gallery below. Still, it should be pointed out that the shooter does seem to have a little problem with over-exposing whites. The camera app offers features such as Beauty, Panorama or HDR, and you can also choose to add a Watermark to your photography. The shooter can also capture 1080p video, but the Honor 6 Plus doesn’t bundle optical image stabilization, so the result turned out be quite shaky in our test. As for the front-facing camera, which is of the 8MP variety, it takes pretty nice selfies. The conclusion is that the Honor 6 Plus is pretty capable of producing drool-worthy pictures for Facebook or Instagram, but you shouldn’t count on it if you want really detailed imagery. Power and performance - it can handle most of the things you throw at it The Honor 6 Plus is powered by one of Huawei’s homegrown octa-core Kirin 925 chipsets, which utilizes four low-power processing cores for everyday tasks and four chunkier cores for more intensive activities. The smartphone does perform quite well no matter the task you assign it. Even demanding games like Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 run on the handset without too many hiccups. The phone scored 43,869 points in AnTuTu, outshining 2014 handsets like the One M8 and Galaxy S5. But this result is no match for 2015’s flagships. For example, Samsung’s recent Galaxy S6 edge managed to score 69K points in the same benchmarking test. Audio quality during calls proved to be quite good, but sometimes we experienced call drops in areas where there is a continuous signal strength problem. Moreover, even if the phone can handle pretty much anything, it does tend to get quite hot. For example, after running the AnTuTu benchmarking tests, the phone was not so comfortable to hold in your hands. Also, if you happen to be on a trip in a new city like we were, and you wonder around with the camera always pointing at something, the phone would again start to get very hot. Another negative point we’d like to highlight is the low quality of the sound via the loudspeaker located on the back of the device. Menu and software - Only Android 4.4.2 KitKat on board While the Android 5.1 Lollipop update has been pushed on numerous devices, the Huawei Honor 6 Plus is still stuck at Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Huawei is notoriously slow in pushing updates, so at this point, maybe the company will roll out Android M directly for the handset. We’re keeping our fingers crossed for this to happen. Huawei has loaded its Emotion UI 3.0 skin on top, which doesn’t have an app drawer. The default icons feature rounded edges, but obviously, you can change this theme if that’s what you want. Among the proprietary apps that come pre-installed on the phone, you’ll find Phone Manager, which features menus such as phone accelerator, harassment filter, power saving, traffic manager, notification manager, app lock, and so on. The Tool folder is home to a host of utility apps, including Mirror, Magnifier, Torch, Notepad, Recorder, FM Radio, Backup, and more. With the Themes app, users are allowed to customize fonts, wallpaper, lock transition, screen, home wallpaper, and basically make their own custom theme. Sliding your finger at the bottom of the screen conjures a slider at the base, which, when pulled up, offers you quick access to weather, voice recording, calculator, torch, and camera app. Sliding your finger at the top of the display reveals two sections: Notifications and Shortcuts. Shortcuts gives you quick access to things like Bluetooth, Brightness adjustment, auto-rotate, settings and several others. The Settings department is filled with a long host of features and functionalities. For example, you can arrange for the screen to be turned on when double touching it. The Navigation bar is also customizable, so you can choose the combination of navigation buttons that suits you best. EMUI includes a Suspend button that sticks to the edges of the display and replicates the navigation bar on a half-wheel. There’s also a One-hand UI model that shrinks up the keyboard, navigation bar and phone UI, and sends it off packing to the corner of the screen. A long press on the square-shaped menu button will bring up recent apps you have used, which can be easily swiped off to shut them or pulled down upon and released to lock them. The Huawei 6 Plus also features notification LEDs that flicker every time you receive something, and you can customize their colors at will. Battery life - better than most As we told you above, Huawei doesn’t particularly like QHD displays because they suck out the phone’s battery life. So it sticks with FHD screens instead. And in some scenarios, this choice actually makes sense. The Honor 6 Plus houses a 3,600 mAh battery which is a lot better than what other handsets on the market have nowadays. The 5.1-inch Galaxy S6 only has a 2,250 mAh battery instead. For example, you will be able to go about taking pictures all day long and the battery won’t disappoint you. You can also spend most of your day using WhatsApp or other social media apps without worries. A 2-hour intense video streaming session would deplete the battery’s resources, leaving it at around 70%, which is not bad, but not exceptionally good either. However, the Honor 6 Plus impresses in standby mode. It can go on to survive 2 to 3 days if its display is not used. Which is pretty handy if you’re up on the mountain somewhere. We should also mention that this Huawei smartphone comes with an Ultra saving mode, which only keeps basic call and message functions available. There’s also a Smart mode that automatically adjust the CPU and network usage in order to balance performance. Connectivity - you know, all the usual good stuff The Huawei Honor 6 Plus features NFC, TD/FDD-LTE Cat 6 and dual-SIM cards, as we mentioned above. On top of that, there’s an infrared transmitter that allows your phone to be turned into a remote control for your TV, Hi-Fi system, or even air conditioning.

The Huawei Honor 6 Plus features NFC, TD/FDD-LTE Cat 6 and dual-SIM cards, as we mentioned above. On top of that, there’s an infrared transmitter that allows your phone to be turned into a remote control for your TV, Hi-Fi system, or even air conditioning. CHECK OUT THE GALLERY The Good. The Huawei Honor 6 Plus is a sleek device that looks and feels quite premium, although there’s a lot of room for improvement. Its octa-core processor is capable of maintaining of sustaining all operations that have to be performed and Huawei’s custom skin for Android is bundled with a bunch of nifty features. The price range of the device is also very affordable considering the specifications. OppoMart is selling the handset for $359. Most importantly, smartphone photography enthusiasts will absolutely love the handset that comes equipped with a dual-camera setup capable of a few neat tricks. The Bad. First off, the Huawei Honor 6 Plus is still stuck at Android 4.4.2 KitKat and with Android M around the corner this is pretty disappointing. Furthermore, the phone doesn’t have an app drawer which might seem counterintuitive to some. Also navigating through the custom interface proves to be quite cluttered and not so smooth to navigate. Conclusion. The phone offers a good value for its specs and given the amount of time we spend on Facebook and Instagram these days, the Honor 6 Plus should be quite a treat for people who love to snap photographs all day every day. Still the fact that Huawei hasn’t bother to update some of its higher-end handsets to the latest Android software, when the rest of the tech world is already there, it’s a pretty big downside. Also Huawei should probably stop trying to copy the iPhone design and focus on coming up with its own innovative look to better match the caliber of its handsets.",

His sculpture, \"No Eye Contact Allowed,\" looked simple; a human bust beneath a plexiglass pedestal casing. But if you break the rules and make eye contact with the sculpture, it knows of your disobedience and shoots harmless squirts at your face.

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment Local lobstermen are concerned increased observation by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration through the Northeast Fishery Observer Program will pose an unnecessary burden and result in potentially crippling regulations. Pete Mason, who works as a lobsterman in Marshfield, said boats already provide NOAA with the information it seeks, such as where they fish, what they catch and what they throw back. “It’s just kind of redundant,” he said. Officials from NOAA, however, say there’s been a misunderstanding. In the past, NOAA has placed observers on boats from all fisheries to monitor by-catch and stocks and conduct economic assessments, but at its discretion. Tight funding meant fisheries in dire circumstances took priority over others, officials said, but also that NOAA had less information about the fisheries they visited less often. When a court decided that NOAA had been exercising too much discretion, it began using a formula to allocate and prioritize observer coverage across all fisheries. Because the formula spreads coverage more evenly, “some fleets are going to see more coverage than in the past, some are going to see less,” Teri Frady, chief of research communications for the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center, said. Lobster fisheries are among those expected to see more coverage than before, but they are not being targeted. “It’s not observer coverage just for the lobster fisheries,” Frady added. NEFOP branch chief Amy Martins said some of the negative reaction is the result of bad timing due to increased regulation in the groundfish industry. Lobstermen, some of whom previously worked in groundfish, fear they are next. That was a concern of Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, too. \"They can collect information that could possibly put them out of business,\" she said. The observers are also another person on a vessel that can't really accommodate them, Casoni said. With miles of line on deck, it's a very different scene than they could expect from groundfish vessels, she said. Martins sympathized with those worries. “Nobody likes to have to take a stranger out in a small confined space when they’ve never had to take a stranger out before,” she said. “The fishing boat is an extension of their home.” “It’s a really hard sell, and it’s not something we like to do heavy-handedly,” Martins added. All observers complete 17 days of classroom training and must make a minimum of four training trips on vessels before being allowed to work as an observer, Martins said, and training for lobster fishery observation is more rigorous. » Comment or view comments",

All observers complete 17 days of classroom training and must make a minimum of four training trips on vessels before being allowed to work as an observer, Martins said, and training for lobster fishery observation is more rigorous. One is that, when the program depletes its funding, fisheries will have to pay for observers themselves. Martins said that worry stems from what people might hear about the At-Sea Monitoring Program, which is unrelated and designed for the industry to fund. A more legitimate concern is insurance. Martins said observers are covered under a $5 million insurance policy as well as under the Federal Employee Compensation Act, but most boats also create additional liability waivers to protect their livelihoods. Drawing up those waivers—which requires hiring and paying an attorney—is a hassle Mason feels fishermen shouldn’t be burdened with, especially when their stock is healthy and isn’t overfished. “It’s like we’re being treated as criminals right off the bat,” he said. Martins said observers are trained to be objective and there are a number of safeguards in place so that data isn’t misinterpreted or twisted. The main point of having observers onboard is to enhance accountability and transparency, which Martins said is NOAA’s job. If the data collected indicates there aren’t any problems, “it can be used in positive ways,” she said. Frady echoed that, and said any regulations that arise will come out of the data. \"We're not looking for a specific result here,\" she said. Editor Kristi Funderburk contributed to this report.

    "LabBody": "Sure, Bill Murray has done his fair share of hilariously random and weird things. But in addition to having a killer sense of humor, the actor is pretty deep—as these quotes show. 1. ON WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE BILL MURRAY, PART ONE. “Nothing prepared me for being this awesome. It's kind of a shock. It's kind of a shock to wake up every morning and be bathed in this purple light.” — From a 2014 Reddit AMA. 2. ON WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE BILL MURRAY, PART TWO. “There's a wonderful sense of well-being that begins to circulate . . . up and down your spine. And you feel something that makes you almost want to smile. So what's it like to be me? Ask yourself, ‘What's it like to be me?’ The only way we'll ever know what it's like to be you is if you work your best at being you as often as you can, and keep reminding yourself that's where home is.” — From a 2014 Q\u0026A during Canada’s Bill Murray Day, via Rolling Stone. 3. ON HOW HE LIVES HIS LIFE. “I live a little bit on the seat of my pants, I try to be alert and available ... for life to happen to me. We’re in this life, and if you’re not available, the sort of ordinary time goes past and you didn’t live it. But if you’re available, life gets huge. You’re really living it.” — From an interview with Charlie Rose, via Flavorwire. 4. ON BEING RELAXED. “The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything: the better you are with your loved ones, the better you are with your enemies, the better you are at your job, the better you are with yourself.” — From a 2012 interview with The New York Times. 5. ON BEING AN ACTOR. “I don't believe that you can give the same performance every take. It's physically impossible, so why bother? If you don't do what is happening at that moment, then it's not real. Then you're holding something back.” — From a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone. 6. ON MARRIAGE. “If you have someone that you think is The One, don't just sort of think in your ordinary mind, ‘OK, let's pick a date. Let's plan this and make a party and get married.’ Take that person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all around the world, and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if, when you come back to JFK ... you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.” — From an impromptu speech at a stranger’s bachelor party, via Huffington Post 7. ON HIS INTERACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. “My hope, always, is that it's going to wake me up. I'm only connected for seconds, minutes a day, sometimes. And suddenly, you go, ‘Holy cow, I've been asleep for two days. I've been doing things, but I'm just out.’ If I see someone who's out cold on their feet, I'm going to try to wake that person up. It's what I'd want someone to do for me. Wake me the hell up and come back to the planet.” — From a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone 8. ON ACTING CLASS VS. LIVE IMPROV. “If you go to actors' class, you don't really die, because there's never really an audience. But if you work for Second City, there's an audience, and you die in the improv set five times out of nine. So, once you get over your fear of dying, nothing else ever really scares you. And Saturday Night Live was as tough as Second City. Once you get through those, making movies is a joke.” — From a 1990 interview with Roger Ebert. 9. ON SEINFELD. “I never had seen Seinfeld, and they said, ‘Oh, it’s the last episode.’ And I said, ‘Oh, I’ll watch Seinfeld.’ And it was terrible.” — From a 2014 interview with Howard Stern. 10. ON WHEN FAME IS A GOOD THING. “There's only a couple times when fame is ever helpful. Sometimes you can get into a restaurant where the kitchen is just closing. Sometimes you can avoid a traffic violation. But the only time it really matters is in the emergency room with your kids. That's when you want to be noticed, because it's very easy to get forgotten in an ER. It's the only time when I would ever say, ‘Thank God. Thank God.’ There's no other time.” — From a 2012 interview with Esquire. 11. ON HIS NOTORIOUS INACCESSIBILITY. “A moat can be a pretty good thing. It can be lovely. It keeps rodents away from the castle. It can have fish in it. Even fish that talk. … If you give people access, they take advantage. My phone would ring 75 times in a row. Finally, I would pick it up and say, ‘Who the hell is this?’ ‘Oh, hi! I’m calling from so-and-so’s office…’ What kind of person would ever, ever let the phone ring 75 times? And I guess that’s when I started thinking: ­I can do without these people.” — From a 2013 interview with TimeOut London. 12. ON BEING AN ARTIST. “It's hard to be an artist. It's hard to be anything. It's hard to be.” — From a 2014 interview with The Independent. 13. ON HIS FATHERING TIPS. “If you bite on everything they throw at you, they will grind you down. You have to ignore a certain amount of stuff. The thing I keep saying to them lately is: ‘I have to love you, and I have the right to ignore you.’ When my kids ask what I want for my birthday or Christmas or whatever, I use the same answer my father did: ‘Peace and quiet.’ That was never a satisfactory answer to me as a kid—I wanted an answer like ‘A pipe.’ But now I see the wisdom of it: All I want is you at your best—you making this an easier home to live in, you thinking of others.” — From a 2012 interview with Esquire. 14. ON PREPARING FOR HIS ROLES. “I’m not that organized. I’m not one of those guys. I mean you read it, you look at it, and you go: I have that in me, I can do that. I don’t necessarily get all mental. There are people that are working with you on every level and on a movie you’re working with people that are, ideally, all serving the same goal and that’s what helps me get into a role.” — From an interview with The Talks. 15. ON HIS MOTHER. “My mother is a real character, a talkative soul who can make friends with anyone, and she'd always been a massive influence on me. She's so animated, I even used to tape phone conversations with her in order to steal material!” — From a 1988 interview with The New York Times. 16. ON MAKING MOVIES. “[I]t's an amazing triumph even to make a bad movie. Even a crap film is really an extraordinary achievement. You're taking a two-dimensional object and making it three-dimensional. The number of people. The number of days. The number of cuts.” — From a 2012 interview with Esquire. 17. ON GILDA RADNER. “Gilda was a fantastic laugher. I never enjoyed making anyone laugh more than her. I remember one day, I made her laugh so hard, she thought she was going to die. And I just couldn’t stop. I used to be really funny, and in those days I used to have almost like a vengeful thing; I could go for a long period of time and try to be funny. I don’t do it like I used to. And I miss that. I’m still funny, but back then I would take something and not let go of it.” — From Live in New York, via Vanity Fair. 18. ON SENTIMENTALITY. “Sentimentality to me is a symbol that we've left the planet. OK, bye-bye. Let me know when you come back because you're no longer here. You just left. It reminds of being at a funeral, like my dad dies and the grief is just overpowering. And all anyone can say to you is, ‘Well, he's probably up there in heaven, bowling with Uncle George.’ It's like, ‘Yeah, that's probably it. He's up there bowling with Uncle George.’ He's dead. He's gone. What am I going to do? Talk to ME. Don't make up your own dreamscape. Stay here with me, will you? Don't go away.” — From a 2014 interview with The New York Times. 19. ON PREPARING TO PLAY FDR. “I’ve always tried to be a little bit loose. This great director we had at Second City [Del Close] said: ‘You wear your characters like a trench coat. It’s still you in there, but there’s like a trench coat.’ So I figured this was like a winter trench coat, because there was just a little bit more character that comes to the party. So I did a lot more reading, a lot more studying.” — From a 2012 interview with The New York Times. 20. ON SAYING NO. “It’s extremely powerful to say no; it’s really the most powerful thing to say.” — From a 2012 interview with the Washington Post. 21. ON FAILURE. “Don't think about your errors or failures, otherwise you'll never do a thing.” — From a 2005 interview with The Guardian. 22. ON HOW TO LIVE LIFE. “As I once said to one of my brothers, ‘This is your life, not a rehearsal.’ Somewhere there’s a score being kept, so you have an obligation to live life as well as you can, be as engaged as you can. The human condition means that we can zone out and forget what the hell we’re doing. So the secret is to have a sense of yourself, your real self, your unique self. And not just once in a while, or once a day, but all through the day, the week and life.

    "LabBody": "Early errors did in the Winston-Salem Dash as the team lost 4-2 to the Potomac Nationals Friday night at BB\u0026T Ballpark. Winston-Salem committed two errors in the top of the first, which led to the Nationals taking a 3-0 lead off Dash starter James Dykstra. The first two runs were scored with two outs and the bases loaded when catcher Omar Narvaez made an errant throw to third trying to pick off Narciso Mesa, and the third came on a double by John Wooten; all three runs were unearned. kAmQxE H2D 2 E@F89 H2J E@ DE2CE @77 E96 82\u003e6[Q s2D9 |2?286C %:\u003e tD\u003e2J D2:5] QqFE H6 H6C6 288C6DD:G6] x =:\u003c6 E92E ~\u003e2C W}2CG26KX H2D ECJ:?8 E@ A:4\u003c D@\u003e63@5J @77 H:E9 E96 32D6D =@2565] w6VD 5@?6 :E 7@C FD 2== J62C] %96 @FE H2D E96C6 E@ 36 925[ 3FE H6 ;FDE 5:5?VE 6I64FE6 E96 A=2J]Qk^Am kAm%96 s2D9 C6DA@?565 H:E9 EH@ CF?D @7 :ED @H? :?

    "DiffbotBody": "Katherine Archuleta has resigned following a massive data breach that put 22 million at risk. Photo: Reuters The chief of the US federal hiring office resigned on Friday after massive computer hacks at the agency that put the personal data of more than 22 million Americans at risk, including people seeking sensitive security clearances. The White House said Katherine Archuleta had stepped down as head of the Office of Personnel Management and that OPM was enhancing cyber-security measures, such as limiting the number of \"privileged users\" of computer data. Archuleta, facing a chorus of demands from Congress for her ouster, said in a statement she had told US President Barack Obama it was \"best for me to step aside and allow new leadership to step in\". Beth Cobert, who works in the White House budget office, will become acting OPM director, the White House said. The departure of Archuleta will not fix OPM's serious cyber-security weaknesses, which Obama administration officials conceded would take months, possibly years, to address. Republicans in Congress accused the administration of being flat-footed on the growing problem of computer hacks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters it was conducting a \"rapid assessment\" of cyber security measures with the aim of accelerating improvements. The latest hacking revelation at OPM, revealed on Thursday, followed what the OPM called a \"separate but related\" computer incursion involving the theft of data on 4.2 million current and former federal workers. Because many of the same people were affected by both hacks, the total comes to about 22.1 million people, or almost 7 per cent of the US population, making the incidents among the most damaging cyber security breaches ever. Social Security numbers and other sensitive data, including possibly compromising secrets gathered for security clearances, were stolen from OPM computers in the sweeping intrusions. The United States has identified China as the leading suspect, but China's Foreign Ministry has dismissed that as \"absurd logic\". Archuleta's departure came a day after Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner issued a statement saying that he had \"no confidence\" in OPM's current leadership. On Friday, Boehner, citing chronic problems at the Veterans Administration that led to the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki last year, said a change in personnel did not always lead to real change and Obama had to \"repair\" the OPM problems. Archuleta, a high-ranking official in Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, was appointed to the top OPM job in May 2013 and sworn in the following November, becoming the first Latina to head the federal agency. The computer hacks at OPM, coupled with computer glitches this week that disrupted operations at both the New York Stock Exchange and United Airlines, have raised serious concerns in US Congress about the security of major US computer systems. In a related matter, arrangements for granting security clearances to employees and contractors have been seriously affected since a computer system used to receive and process applications was turned off temporarily on June 29, government security sources said. The digital system, called E-QIP, had been the main platform through which applicants submitted detailed information about their background on a questionnaire known as Standard Form 86. The system was shut down for security enhancements. A source familiar with the process said there were now serious problems handling the flow of paper forms, and concern that digitising them could expose them to the risk of hacking. A senior Obama Administration official acknowledged that the process had been \"hindered\" by the E-QIP shutdown but said the digital system would be restored in four to six weeks. Reuters Apple has released a public beta of its latest operating system for the Mac, El Capitan. While Apple is touting speed improvements and new search features, it is a feature under the hood that has caught the eye of developers and system administrators. Security Integrity Protection is a new feature of OS X that aims to protect users from malicious code infecting the operating system. In recent years, Apple has moved to tighten security on the Mac, implementing some of the features proven to be successful in iOS. Back in 2012, Apple began enforcing sandboxing on all Mac App Store applications. Heightened security always comes at a cost. Marc Edwards, Bjango Sandboxing refers to the boundary placed around an app and its executable code. Sandboxed applications run in their own little environment, protected from other applications, accessing only parts of the system Apple has allowed. On iOS, all Apps are sandboxed, and always have been. On the Mac, only App Store applications are sandboxed. But the vast majority of Mac applications do not come from the Mac App Store. Applications such as Microsoft Office and Adobe's Creative Cloud sit outside Apple's sandbox environment. Security Integrity Protection is a way of tightening the security around these applications. Software developers are now blocked from editing or writing to certain protected files and folders within OS X – or from executing code that tinkers with the system. Marc Edwards, of Bjango software, is one such developer. \"We had to make some changes to get iStat Menus working again\" he admits. iStat Menus is a popular system-monitoring app for the Mac that until now has relied on accessing system files. Bjango already has a working beta of iStat Menus that plays nice under Apple's new rules, but not all developers will be able to work under El Capitan's restrictions. Still, Edwards understands the reason behind SIP. \"System Integrity Protection is a great idea and it should help make our Macs a bit safer from malicious code. But, at the same time, it's also another step towards not being able to control what runs on your computer. Heightened security always comes at a cost. I'm worried about OS X becoming more like iOS – only one source to install stuff, everything really tightly sandboxed.\" While developers and tinkerers might find Apple's new rules frustrating, Mac system administrators seem more positive. Marcus Ransom, lead Apple technician at RMIT University, welcomes the change. He is part of a team that manages more than 2500 Macs and sees thousands more on RMIT's network every day. For Ransom, the security benefits SIP will bring to Mac users far outweigh any teething problems. \"System Integrity Protection is a game changer for Mac OS X in the enterprise. Whilst there are going to be some initial challenges to overcome, such as issues with legacy software and vendors who do not adhere to Apple's recommendations on which parts of the OS are off-limits, the ability to provide additional protection to our systems whilst maintaining flexibility is something that RMIT University is looking forward to.\" \"Whereas we have control over the systems that ITS manages, the tens of thousands of BYOD Macs that our students bring on campus are an entirely different matter. Apple is taking the lead here and making it simple for consumers to protect their own data without needing the skills and resources of a large IT department.\" Equally positive is Aaron Lippincott, Systems Administrator at Beyond. \"OS X El Capitan's new SIP and FileVault settings are like a little Help Desk Agent living inside our users Macs\" A colleague of mine explained the benefits of System Integrity Protection, as he saw them, succinctly: \"How often do you have to fix your parents' iPad?\" System Integrity Protection can be disabled in El Capitan by booting into the OS X recovery partition and switching it off. But this is not something I can see the average user doing, so it will be up to software developers to update their applications to work under Apple's new security guidelines. The geeks and tinkerers that do turn off System Integrity Protection may just be delaying the inevitable. It would not surprise me to see SIP become mandatory in future releases of OS X, as Apple look to secure their desktop environment even further.

Celeb hair stylist Nikki Lee softly French-braided two sections of the actress's hair across the back of her head in a diagonal direction. Below that, she took two more sections and knotted them together, then joined the knot and French braid together with a rubber band.

    "DiffbotBody": "The superintendent got a vote of confidence. He deserves the Medal of Honor IN A VOTE of confidence, the School Reform Commission last week said it owed Superintendent William Hite what it called a \"performance bonus.\" It should have been called combat pay. That's the extra pay given to members of the U.S. military who serve in \"designated combat zones or hazardous duty areas.\" That pretty much describes the Philadelphia School District, certainly in 2012 when Hite took over after the SRC fired Superintendent Arlene Ackerman. They were perilous times, certainly for the students in the District. The state has slashed about $500 million in aid, creating a huge hole in the district's budget. A round of layoffs - that would continue for several years - was just beginning. Ackerman, whose imperious style earned her the nickname \"Queen Arlene,\" had a knack for making enemies, so the District had few friends in the outside world, especially among the politicians who controlled the purse strings. Hite was the calm after the Ackerman storm. A Virginian with a courtly manner, Hite began his career as a classroom teacher, rising through the ranks to become superintendent of public schools in Prince George's County, in Maryland. It was a large district, though nothing could fully prepare him for the challenge of running an urban school district in the battlefield called Philadelphia. What he was able to draw upon are character traits that make him a good leader. He has offered a consistency of vision, a pro-child and pro-parent agenda, a genuine belief that every child can learn and a determination about making real change in how schools operate in this city. What Hite also brought to the table was a personality that won over critics. He never raises his voice. He never points his finger to blame. He exhibits patience and forbearance - even in the face of screaming protesters or angry lawmakers. Instead, he has countered with a call for \"shared sacrifices\" by all parties involved in education in the city to pull the District out of the hole it fell into before he arrived. We can't say he has succeeded, but that failure is due to forces outside of his control. With the notable exception of Mayor Nutter, he has not gotten much from the political class. He's still at loggerheads with the teachers union over concessions he's sought. Financially, the district is no longer under siege but it's still a combat zone. Services are at a minimal level. Resources are scant. This week, Hite moved ahead with changes he had been planning centered on decentralizing power in the district, reasoning that if he waited for needed money to arrive he could be waiting forever. That is called optimism. He has restored the reputation to a system that was so lacking when he arrived. That is called credibility. He has consistently shown grace under pressure, which is one definition of courage. Hite makes a good salary. But, it's no surprise, given his performance, that the SRC wanted to give him a $60,000 bonus. And it's no surprise that Hite turned it down, saying it would be unfair given the district's finances. We call that leadership.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Nowadays, more than ever, sports and style go hand-in-hand. Athletes are extremely high profile and are consistently in the spotlight. Therefore they need to make sure that their game off the playing field is as fresh as their game on it. No one emphasizes that more than Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard. It’s possible that Dwight misses Game 5 against the Golden State Warriors for his hit on Andrew Bogut — that doesn’t mean he can’t still look good on the bench. Howard is one of the better centers in the NBA, but he’s also proving to be one of the better dressed athletes out there. And there are plenty of players who know how to put together an outfit. In our opinion, these are the seven most stylish athletes in sports today. 1. David Beckham David Beckham may be an ex-professional footballer, but he’s still an English icon. And his style always matches that of his status: it’s legit. It’s a tailor-made look for a guy who knows how to sport quality clothing. It’s as if he’s James Bond. But what else would you expect from a guy who married a Spice Girl? That’s British royalty right there. 2. Cam Newton Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has a playful style to go along with his playful personality. Newton is a big guy (6-foot-5, 245 pounds), with a big smile, who appears to enjoy himself like a big kid. He likes to mix and match (notice the bow tie and the graffitied kicks). Cam Newton is dressed to have a good time. 3. Kevin Durant Kevin Durant is so fluid and smooth on the basketball court. When he steps onto the floor for the Oklahoma City Thunder, his game is simply effortless. But when the buzzer sounds and it’s time to step out into the real world, KD’s look is just as cool. He has plenty of confidence (as he should) and he’s not afraid to go with the bold colors. This is why he’s an MVP no matter where he is. 4. Dwyane Wade Dwyane Wade may constantly be battling with chronic knee issues, but there’s never been any problems with his sense of style. The Miami Heat legend knows how to put together an outfit. Great tux. Sleek bow tie. Cool pocket square. And a flashy watch. Wade has the gentleman look down pat. We’re sure his wife, Gabrielle Union, would agree that D Wade is totally GQ material. 5. Cristiano Ronaldo Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo may seem arrogant and overly cocky, but there’s no denying that his play on the pitch backs up this attitude. He is a goal-scoring machine with incredible speed and an unbelievable touch on the ball. Plus, he is a major fashionista. Ronaldo is always dressed to impress and, most of all, he knows it. We have no problem giving the Real Madrid superstar his due. He’s shown that he deserves it. 6. Tom Brady Super Bowl winner. Supermodel wife. Superhuman? No doubt about it. Tom Brady is Captain America. It’s the only thing that makes sense. After all, he is the quarterback for the New England Patriots. Brady can pull off any look he wants and no one’s going to question it. He also happens to have all the credibility he’ll ever need on his arm. It’s good to be Tom Brady. 7. Russell Westbrook There may be no athlete on the planet more stylish than OKC point guard Russell Westbrook. He’s seriously in a league of his own. The only thing more tight than his game on the court are the pants he rocks off of it. But he somehow makes it work. Not to mention, he can pull off the colorful shirt with ease. But his real signature look involves thick-rimmed glasses. He has many of them to go along with his many outfits. They don’t even have a prescription, but we don’t care. No script, no problem.

    "DiffbotBody": "Though Sleeper is a gentler record than any other in Ty Segall’s catalogue, the title track does have a specific precursor: 2011’s “Goodbye Bread”, another album opener, was an annunciation of sorts, a broadening of the range we’d come to expect from one of California’s leading garage rockers. It was the prettiest thing Segall had done up to that point, and the saddest. And with “Sleeper”, he makes good on that promise of depth, channeling pain and anger into one of his most poignant songs. Segall both writes and plays with a sincerity that never devolves into sentimentality, but his voice is strained, his guitar is heavy and loose, and there’s a subtle otherworldliness, an ethereal lilting feedback buried within that’s only revealed once the song’s reached its end. —Jonah Bromwich Con · trolled – verb Definition: The act of decimating rivals to inflict public humiliation. Characterized by exhibition of no mercy or sympathy for perceived weaknesses in an opponent. Etymology: The verb first came to usage on August 12, 2013, when G.O.O.D. Music stocking stuffer Big Sean dropped “Control” on Twitter. The seven-and-a-half minute song featured the ghost of Jay Electronica and Kendrick Lamar, with the latter name-checking his peers with the scorched earth purism of Edward Snowden. Within three hours of it leaking, edits had been made to expunge any trace of Sean or Electronica. Within several days, Tumblr had been converted into an infinite “Control” meme. Kendrick’s “King of New York” line prompted responses from New York rappers as futile as attacking Gozer with blades of grass. It sparked a beef between Kendrick and Drake, “the soft rapper he tucked into his pajama clothes.” LeBron James tweeted: \"This is real hip hop at his best! We going crazy over here people!!” Phil Jackson even took a break from meditating atop a totem pole to gently lecture about the value of mentorship. This wasn’t the best Kendrick Lamar-featured song of 2013. That would be “Jealous” with Fredo Santana or “Nosetalgia” with Pusha T. But it had the most impact—effectively ending the rap “Super Friends” era and ensuring that being “Controlled” replaced “Renegaded” and “Ethered” in the lexicon of verbs of mass destruction. You can’t inherit the rap throne; it’s something you have to usurp. And this was the sound of King Kendrick annexing new lands, sticking his flag into the hearts of men. —Jeff Weiss Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories succeeded because it was both a little bit of everything and a unified album statement. They picked up Paul Williams for theatrical bombast (\"Touch\"), Julian Casablancas for robo-cool (\"Instant Crush\"), and Todd Edwards for yacht rock (\"Fragments of Time\"). To get some indie pop into the mix they called upon Animal Collective’s Panda Bear, whose previous guest spots usually sounded much better in concept than execution. Not this time, though. The track Daft Punk built around him plays perfectly to his strengths, taking his genius with short, catchy, and repetitive melodic phrases and building a hooky mid-tempo electro-pop tune out of them. A little bit of joy, a little bit of yearning, a whole lot of simplicity: night, right, magic, and everybody’s dancing. \"Doin’ It Right\" is the album’s best example of machine precision grafted onto gentle human warmth. —Mark Richardson The title track of an album named after single-minded focus turned out to be a magicianly exercise in distraction. When Deerhunter debuted \"Monomania\" on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, the sleight of hand was almost literal: Wigged frontman Bradford Cox's fingers were disturbingly bandaged, and the camera followed him as he walked offstage, snatched someone's water, and waited for an elevator rather than finish out his vocals. On Monomania, too, the insistent repetitions, white noise, and motorcycle sound effects at the end of the song could turn attention away from the rest of its Bible-belted longing, ostensibly for another man. And just what was Cox being so monomaniacal about, anyway? Wasn't this a sloppy, tossed-off return to some garage-punk ideal? True enough, the song has a scabrous bloodthirstiness not heard from the Atlanta band since 2009 bonus album Weird Era Cont. But often overlooked is how it carries out that record's vision of a \"cassette cathedral.\" Not your fact-checking older cuz's lo-fi, \"Monomania\" epitomizes the way Deerhunter \"strung together a bunch of eight-tracks so they were like microphones\" for Monomania, building a magnificently detailed sonic edifice without losing that grainy demo-lover's aesthetic. Pals the Black Keys called this approach \"transcend-fi,\" but that too potentially distracts. And that's just it: Refusing to distinguish romantic obsession from musical fixation, provocation from hooks, and finally (\"mono, monomania...\") sense from nonsense, \"Monomania\" is where Deerhunter make a junkyard-art point so undeniable they had to point away from it for it to be understood. —Marc Hogan FKA twigs told an interviewer earlier this year that she dashed off the lyrics and melody to \"Water Me\", the eeriest ballad of 2013, \"in about seven minutes,\" just double the length of the song itself. On one hand, this feat is totally comprehensible; plenty of iconic songs were written quickly, and \"Water Me\" is filled with cavernous space, thanks in large part to twigs' now-Yeezus-credentialed collaborator Arca. On the other, considering how potent the song's simple lyrics actually are, that she flung them on a page in just minutes seems almost too good to be true. Haunting and heartbroken, \"Water Me\" is abandonment embodied; it floats detached and orbiting in space, frozen, yet perpetually falling. The devastation is palpable, but so is the despairing realism, the one that made the song strike home this year, amidst myriad defeats concerning sexuality and rights: there is no vindication here, nor may there be tomorrow. Twigs' pain is small and guarded, but it is direct, and it echoes. In the song's video, she sheds a solitary thick, plasmic tear as she sings, \"I promise I can grow tall/ When making love is free.\" Such a deeply rooted, elemental sentiment hints that perhaps \"Water Me\" wasn't such a difficult song to write after all. —Devon Maloney Just to fuck with you, Kanye West capped off the barbed-wire Yeezus with soulful outlier “Bound 2”, a taste of what Yeezus could’ve been or maybe was at one point in time but now will never be. To make things worse, he then performed the song on \"Jimmy Fallon\" and took it into an even livelier place—what we thought was a single underground tunnel to sunlight might have actually been an entire underground network of fluorescent caves that not even James Turrell could dream up. But, because he’s never done, Yeezus then threw the eephus, gifting the world the bizarre and uncanny “Bound 2” video which, whatever you think of it, and thanks to a little outside help, is a lock to be the most memorable visual of this year or next. On an album that takes itself awful seriously throughout, “Bound 2” is something that recontextualizes the entire affair, leaving more questions than answers. Is there a backlog of similarly-angled, soul-dappled B-sides sitting in a studio (or penthouse suite) somewhere? Is Charlie Wilson the secret weapon of the year? What would Jeromey Rome think? Did Kanye just make an album about his penis? “Bound 2” is Kanye’s last laugh. We ain’t got the answers. —Corban Goble",
    "LabBody": "Looking at James Hinton's biography, you'd assume we were talking about a wacky new neighbor on \"The Big Bang Theory\" and not one of the most slyly gratifying electronic musicians to come along this year. The Brown University grad majored in physics, has a self-professed love for math and cosmology, and spends too much time on YouTube. And though little of this specifically informs \"Metal Swing\", the final track on his first album as the Range, it does show how well Hinton works with contradictions. So while his pedigree might be low-key geek, \"Metal Swing\" is anything but eggheaded, leading with its gut instead of its brain. Built around a cyclical piano-based melody and a tip-toeing bass line, its internal rhythm feels almost tidal: Cautious, hypnotic, a little uneasy. And then, all of a sudden: \"Why's this guy threatening?\" The voice belongs to an unidentified, Cockney-accented UK rapper spewing puffed-chested and carefully calculated bluster. There's very little about \"Metal Swing\" that feels threatening—to have empty schoolyard barbs anchor the track seems almost counterintuitive. But therein lies the subtle but risky mechanics at the heart of \"Metal Swing\", a demonstration of how incongruent shapes can create a strange, rewarding harmony. —Zach Kelly. The Range: \"Metal Swing\" (via SoundCloud)",

    "DiffbotBody": "Miniature golf is one of the most fun and versatile summer pastimes. It can be played outdoors, at night, indoors in the dark, or even on a giant recreation of Noah’s Ark. For more on that last one, you’ll have to read through our guide to the greatest mini-golf courses in America… Mayday Golf, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: The best mini-golf courses mix a fun theme with creative course construction. Oh, and having a crashed plane sticking out of a waterfall doesn’t hurt. Choose from Mayday Mountain—18 holes that wind around a mountain and underneath the downed plane—and Rescue Falls, which ends with a model helicopter coming to your rescue. Relax: There’s no smoke monster. Old Pro Golf 68th Street, Ocean City, Maryland: The venerable Old Pro chain of mini-golf courses are beloved by multiple generations of Ocean City beachgoers. And the 68th Street location is the closest you’ll get to swinging clubs in Jurassic Park. The course offers a healthy variety of holes with obstacles ranging from pesky prehistoric lizards to an angry club-wielding caveman. Par-King Skill Golf, Lincolnshire, Illinois: Dating back to the 1950s, Par-King has been dubbed “Mini-Golf’s Taj Mahal.” It’s definitely one of the strangest courses out there, with holes featuring everything from spaceships to castles to a mini Mount Rushmore. Additional obstacles like clowns, merry-go-rounds, and a Sears Tower replica only add to the course’s surreal Americana vibe. Smuggler’s Cove Adventure Golf, various Florida locations: Many golf courses boast pirate themes, but only one offers real reptiles! Every Smuggler’s Cove location features live gators you can feed (if you dare) with bamboo fishing poles. Just be careful where you whack your ball—if the gators get it, not even Chubbs Peterson can retrieve it for you. Glowing Greens, Portland and Beaverton, Oregon: Ever wanted to play mini-golf inside a gonzo black light painting? That’s the experience you’ll get at Oregon’s indoor Glowing Greens courses. Playing in the dark might seem weird, but you’ll get used to it once you pop on your 3D glasses and experience animated skeletons, aliens and other obstacles. Trippy, dude. Lexington Ice Center, Lexington, Kentucky: The Travel Channel raved about the greens at this ice skating/family fun center. It’s definitely the only mini-golf course where you can play on models of Mount Sinai and Noah’s Ark. Yes, there’s a Biblical theme, with courses based on the Old Testament, New Testament and “Miracles.” Have fun, but be sure to heed the first Commandment: “If thy ball should land in a water hazard, thou must taketh a penalty stroke.” Molten Mountain, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: The main attraction at Molten Mountain golf is the titular 50-foot man-made volcano that actually erupts and spews forth pink “lava.” Sure the lava looks a bit like Pepto-Bismol. But you’ll be too distracted by two mini-golf courses—one inside the mountain and one out—to ponder how exactly they get the water to turn that color. KISS Monster Mini-Golf, Las Vegas: Leave it to the legendary rockers to deliver the most extreme (and bizarre) mini-golf course of all time. In addition to 18 holes of rock-’n’-roll-themed madness, the venue boasts scarily accurate animatronic versions of the band, the world’s largest KISS memorabilia store and a wedding chapel. It is Vegas, after all. Lumberjack Pass Miniature Golf, Lake George, New York: Set against the breathtaking Adirondack Mountains, this bucolic gem spreads its 18 holes over an acre of land with plenty of actual flowing waterfalls and treacherous sand traps. They also supply ball washers to clean your balls. For when they get caught in a sand trap, of course. Space Golf, Orland Park, Illinois: Golfers and sci-fi fans alike flock to this indoor golf mecca. Models of Darth Vader, Yoda and Borg Captain Picard greet players as they enter a course filled with spaceships, aliens and more galactic wonders. It’s the closest you’ll get to a Star Wars-themed golf course in this galaxy. Just don’t argue over who gets to shoot first—the answer is always Han Solo.",

It provided a welcome distraction from the relentless barrage of headlines about municipal budgets, purple bags, $10 trash fees, net school spending, and casinos. Comment » RELATED CONTENT • Our View: Sick leave is a healthy law for Massachusetts Michael Holtzman’s story in The Herald News about the censure of Shawn Cadime by a governmental management association may be unexciting to some; but for me, it provides a fascinating lesson about politics, organizational rules, professional ethics, and ego. If you missed it, here are the essential facts: Cadime, currently serving as Seekonk’s town administrator, was, until recently, a member of the International City/County Management Association, a group comprised of about 9,000 local government professionals worldwide. It’s probably not unlike thousands of trade organizations whose members share a common interest or profession. In this particular case, the ground rules for membership are apparently quite clear, and Cadime broke them, resulting in a censure from ICMA. It seems the organization frowns upon its members getting directly involved in political activity. And because he ran for mayor in 2014 while serving as a town administrator, Cadime got his wrist slapped by those who run ICMA. He should have seen this coming, but it appears he was blindsided by the organization’s negative assessment of his actions. It’s a pretty clear-cut case. ICMA says its members can’t run for office, seek endorsements, or raise funds for political campaigns. Shawn Cadime did all that and more while serving simultaneously as Seekonk’s town administrator and an ICMA member. What makes this a notable story is not the censure itself, but Cadime’s reaction to it. Rather than claim ignorance of the guidelines, or admit openly that he intentionally violated the group’s prescribed doctrines as a matter of principle, Cadime was unapologetic, scratching his head and wondering what all the fuss was about. Not only did he call the censure “laughable” and “ludicrous,” he asked rhetorically, “Where’s the violation? I don’t get it.” This reaction ignores the fact that ICMA clearly spells out the ethical expectations of its members. The guidelines state that political activity of any kind “undermine(s) public confidence in professional administrators.” The group apparently views its members as government professionals who need to consciously steer clear of political involvement or influence. Reasonable people can argue whether that constitutes a fair and sensible requirement. But if you voluntarily sign up as a member of an organization that holds to that belief, you either play by their rules or, if politics is your thing, you end your membership. Cadime severed ties with the organization, but only after the reprimand came down. » Comment or view comments",

Cadime severed ties with the organization, but only after the reprimand came down. It’s clear that this little dust-up will not impede Cadime’s professional career in any way. He’s young, bright, talented, and will continue to rack up a pretty impressive resume as he makes his way through the public or private sector. I strongly suspect that elective office is in his future and that he’s well-suited to serve. In all likelihood, his censure will soon be a forgotten footnote. Few people have ever heard of the ICMA or care about it at all. But most people I know play by the rules and expect others, especially government officials, to do the same. They justifiably resent it when public figures behave in a way that says those rules don’t apply to them. Had Cadime simply resigned his ICMA membership at the time he made his decision to run for public office, there would be no censure and this story wouldn’t have been a story at all.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, has resigned from her post amid a cascading scandal over her handling of a massive breach of federal employee data. Archuleta, who has been at the helm of OPM since November 2013, submitted her resignation Friday morning. OPM announced Thursday that the size of a hack that began last year led to the pilfering of sensitive personal information of 21.5 million former and current employees. That admission, following weeks of scrutiny on Capitol Hill after OPM acknowledged a separate data breach that affected 4.2 million, led to a rush of lawmakers who called for her ousting, including the top three House Republicans and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. (RELATED: OPM Doesn't Know Who It Will Hire to Protect the 21.5 Million Individuals Affected by Hack) Officials have privately linked both data breaches to China. Beth Cobert, the deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget, will take over Archuleta's job on an interim basis. The OPM director position must be confirmed by the Senate, and the Obama administration will have to grapple with a Republican-controlled Congress that is deeply skeptical about the agency in order to approve a permanent replacement. \"Today I informed the OPM workforce that I am stepping down as the leader of this remarkable agency and the remarkable people who work for it,\" Archuleta said in a statement. \"This morning, I offered, and the President accepted, my resignation as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. I conveyed to the President that I believe it is best for me to step aside and allow new leadership to step in, enabling the agency to move beyond the current challenges and allowing the employees at OPM to continue their important work.\" (RELATED: OPM Announces More Than 21 Million Affected by Second Data Breach) White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that Archuleta offered her resignation \"of her own volition. \"That's precisely why the president accepted her resignation,\" Earnest said. The data breach compromised 19.7 million individuals' Social Security numbers, and the remainder of the affected individuals—1.8 million people—were family and friends. In addition to Social Security numbers, the stolen information included employment history, financial and health history, addresses, and even fingerprints. The hack announced Thursday occurred at roughly the same time as another hack, which OPM announced in June. That data breach affected 4.2 million current and former federal workers, 3.6 million of whom were also affected by the larger breach. Archuleta had remained resolute in the face of withering scrutiny, and the White House had expressed support for her as recently as Thursday. When asked on a press call if she would step down, Archuleta said \"no\" and credited her agency with improving its cybersecurity since she had taken over. \"It is because the efforts of OPM and its staff that we've been able to identify the breaches,\" Archuleta said. But on Friday, Earnest said the agency is in need of a change. \"It's quite clear that new leadership with a set of skills and experiences that are unique to the urgent challenges that OPM faces are badly needed. That accounts for the acting director that the president has appointed.\" Archuleta served as a national political director for President Obama's reelection campaign. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a GOP candidate for the White House, had taken to referring to her as a \"political hack\" who needed to be removed. Warner, who represents thousands of federal workers living in Northern Virginia, said Friday, \"This is the right move for the agency and all those affected by the breach.\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Archuleta's removal was the \"right decision, and one that will help to restore confidence in an agency that not only poorly defended sensitive data of millions of Americans but struggled to respond to repeated intrusions.\" \"This change in leadership is also an acknowledgement that we cannot simply place blame on the hackers, but need to take responsibility for the protection of personal information that is so obvious a target,\" Schiff added. Rep. Ted Lieu said in a statement after Archuleta's resignation that the OPM should not be in charge of storing background-check data. \"OPM was never designed to be an intelligence or national security agency,\" the California Democrat said. \"We should not be trying to fit a square into a round hole. That's why Congressman Steve Russell and I are working on legislation to move the security clearance system out of OPM.\" OPM said Thursday it would notify the 21.5 million individuals affected by the larger hack, and offer them at least three years of comprehensive credit monitoring and fraud-protection services at no cost. But the agency does not yet have a contractor in place to provide the services. This story has been updated. Rebecca Nelson contributed to this article.",

The hack an­nounced Thursday oc­curred at roughly the same time as an­oth­er hack, which OPM an­nounced in June. That data breach af­fected 4.2 mil­lion cur­rent and former fed­er­al work­ers, 3.6 mil­lion of whom were also af­fected by the lar­ger breach. Archu­leta had re­mained res­ol­ute in the face of with­er­ing scru­tiny, and the White House had ex­pressed sup­port for her as re­cently as Thursday. When asked on a press call if she would step down, Archu­leta said “no” and cred­ited her agency with im­prov­ing its cy­ber­se­cur­ity since she had taken over. “It is be­cause the ef­forts of OPM and its staff that we’ve been able to identi­fy the breaches,” Archu­leta said.

Adam Schiff, the top Demo­crat on the House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee, said Archu­leta’s re­mov­al was the “right de­cision, and one that will help to re­store con­fid­ence in an agency that not only poorly de­fen­ded sens­it­ive data of mil­lions of Amer­ic­ans but struggled to re­spond to re­peated in­tru­sions.” “This change in lead­er­ship is also an ac­know­ledge­ment that we can­not simply place blame on the hack­ers, but need to take re­spons­ib­il­ity for the pro­tec­tion of per­son­al in­form­a­tion that is so ob­vi­ous a tar­get,” Schiff ad­ded. Rep. Ted Lieu said in a state­ment after Archu­leta’s resig­na­tion that the OPM should not be in charge of stor­ing back­ground-check data. “OPM was nev­er de­signed to be an in­tel­li­gence or na­tion­al se­cur­ity agency,” the Cali­for­nia Demo­crat said. “We should not be try­ing to fit a square in­to a round hole. That’s why Con­gress­man Steve Rus­sell and I are work­ing on le­gis­la­tion to move the se­cur­ity clear­ance sys­tem out of OPM.” OPM said Thursday it would no­ti­fy the 21.5 mil­lion in­di­vidu­als af­fected by the lar­ger hack, and of­fer them at least three years of com­pre­hens­ive cred­it mon­it­or­ing and fraud-pro­tec­tion ser­vices at no cost. But the agency does not yet have a con­tract­or in place to provide the ser­vices. This story has been up­dated. Rebecca Nelson contributed to this article.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "MADISON — The Catapult thrill ride that malfunctioned just before it was to launch two riders through the air at the Mt. Olympus Water and Theme Park on Wednesday in Wisconsin Dells passed a recent safety inspection but has been cited for past violations, state inspection records show. A video of the malfunctioning ride showed that a mechanism anchoring the two elastic bands that propel the ride apparently broke down shortly after the riders were locked into their protective cage. The video went viral after it was posted on Facebook. The owners of the ride were told to remove it from the Mt. Olympus property Friday, according to theme park officials. The Catapult passed an inspection last month by an investigator for the state’s Department of Safety and Professional Services but its owner — Nashotah-based Casco — was cited in 2013 for failing to show any documentation that the ride’s wire rope and hoist operations were inspected by an independent third party, records from the Department of Safety and Professional Services showed. Investigators also could not find any documentation of current CPR or first aide certifications. The Catapult’s owner also was cited in 2011 for poor record keeping and was ordered to document and maintain records for daily and periodic inspections, any maintenance that was performed on the ride as well as training for the ride’s operators. An identical order was issued in 2011 for Apollo’s Swing, another ride owned by Casco that is still operational at Mt. Olympus, records show. Speed Rock, a third ride owned by Casco at Mt. Olympus, is no longer operational. In 2006, investigators found that its cables were not replaced annually as requested by its manufacturer and the Consumers Products Safety Commission, state records show. That same year, the Catapult’s operators were ordered by investigators to update their first-aid and CPR certifications, records showed. The owner of Casco was listed as Richard Clark of Nashotah. Clark did not return messages left at phone numbers registered to him and Casco. Online court records show that Casco has faced more than $15,000 in workers compensation penalty warrants and delinquent unemployment compensation and delinquent tax issues since 2002.

    "DiffbotBody": "Ben Affleck has played plenty of roles in his career, but a Yankees fan? That's where he draws the line. You might have heard that during the filming of Gone Girl, director David Fincher kindly asked Affleck to sport a Yankees hat for a scene in which his character, Nick Dunne, was attempting to go unrecognized in an airport. The scene in question took place in New York, so it wasn't as though Fincher was simply trolling Affleck's endless love for the Red Sox, but the actor couldn't bring himself to don the cap of the hated Bronx Bombers. \"I said, 'David, I love you, I would do anything for you,'\" Affleck told The New York Times in 2014. \"'But I will not wear a Yankees hat. I just can't. I can't wear it because it's going to become a thing, David. I will never hear the end of it. I can't do it.' And I couldn't put it on my head.\" And he really couldn't. Because, as Fincher reveals in his director's commentary on the Gone Girl DVD and Blu-ray, it took them four days to reach a compromise – a Mets hat – and during that time, there was no communication, no filming, nothing. All over a baseball hat. \"I really wanted it to be a Yankees cap but [inhales loudly], being from Boston and not being very professional as an actor, Ben refused to wear a Yankees cap,\" Fincher said. \"I mean it did not come to blows but we had to shut down production for four days.\" That inhale is telling, revealing both Fincher's love of minute details and Affleck's bullheaded dedication to his beloved Sox. Ben also told The Times that the hat was the only fight he had with Fincher and it was basically a \"one-man riot against the Yankees.\" The good news: No punches were thrown. And you've got to give him credit for standing his ground – if he would've been seen wearing a Yankees cap, he never would've heard the end of it from Matt Damon. 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Photo By courtesy /courtesy Elizabeth Ruth Dielmann “Betty” Breen Born: Dec. 13, 1924, San Antonio Died: June 30, 2015, San Antonio Preceded by: Parents Henry B. and Ivetta Trester Dielmann; ex-husband Jerry P. Breen Jr.; two brothers and a sister. Survived by: Sons Hank Breen, Pete Breen and daughter-in-law Jenni, Pat Breen and daughter-in-law Mallory, Bob Breen and daughter-in-law Roxane, Mike Breen and daughter-in-law Johnnie, Bill Breen and daughter-in-law Teri; daughters Cathy Mellgren and son-in-law John, Eloise Silva and son-in-law Bernie, Cindy Breen, Ann Callahan and son-in-law Sam, and Jan Doss and son-in-law Steve; 20 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren. Services: Rosary from 7 to 8 p.m. July 19; Mass at 10:30 a.m. July 20, followed by a celebration of life, all at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, 600 Oblate Drive. Of her many accomplishments in life — becoming a real estate agent after she and her husband divorced in midlife, extensive volunteerism, and her service as a Navy WAVE during World War II — the most important to Elizabeth Ruth Dielmann “Betty” Breen was her 11 children. Teaching each of them that doing for others was “the way to live life,” Breen, a devout Catholic, led by example. “To us success is how much you have affected another; it’s the foundation of what you do.” Breen died June 30 at 90. Born just a few years before the start of the Great Depression, in 1924, she was adopted by Ivetta and Henry Dielmann when her birth family was unable to support her. Henry Dielmann, an assistant city attorney who served in the Texas House of Representatives for three terms, also was the first dean of St. Mary’s University Law School. “She thought the sun rose and set on her father,” Breen’s daughter Cathy Mellgren said. Educated in Catholic schools, Breen graduated from St. Mary’s High School in 1941, enrolling at what was then Our Lady of the Lake College before withdrawing at the start of World War II to work for the Bell system as a telephone operator. As her brothers and friends went off to war, Breen decided to join the Navy, becoming a WAVE, or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, serving at Alameda Naval Air Station in California after training in government communications at the Pentagon. Returning to San Antonio after her discharge, Breen again enrolled at Our Lady of the Lake before marrying her high school sweetheart in 1947. After living in College Station as her husband finished college at Texas A\u0026M University, the family returned to San Antonio, settling on the near North Side. As her family grew, Breen rose to the challenge of getting by on a limited budget. “My dad gave her $40 a week” for groceries, Mellgren said. “She bought in bulk before Sam’s ever existed.” As Breen’s oldest daughter, Mellgren has vivid memories of helping her mother with her youngest siblings, twin sisters. “The … washer, it seemed like it ran 24 hours a day,” Mellgren said. “There were no disposable diapers, they were all cloth, cotton diapers; the bed was piled high with all these diapers she had to fold.” As busy as she was, Breen still made time for volunteer work, guiding her children through the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and raising funds for Blessed Sacrament Parish, Providence and Central Catholic high schools and Our Lady of the Lake University. Breen also chaired the Assumption Seminary Polo Fest for many years. “Betty always made her famous egg rolls,” her friend Barbara Klauer said. “She toiled many nights and froze them in advance … donated everything, and her kids and friends helped fry them and sell them at the festival.” Sometimes, if Breen had another commitment, her children would step in to help. “It would take six of us to do what my mom would do, and we would be exhausted,” her daughter Ann Callahan said. “The weekend she fractured her hip, it about killed all of us.” Breen continued helping others after becoming a real estate agent in 1981, at the age of 60. “She loved it, helping people find homes,” Mellgren said. Sometimes “they could barely afford housing, but she would get them qualified, even loan them the money for the closing costs.”",
    "LabBody": "Of her many accomplishments in life — becoming a real estate agent after she and her husband divorced in midlife, extensive volunteerism, and her service as a Navy WAVE during World War II — the most important to Elizabeth Ruth Dielmann “Betty” Breen was her 11 children. Teaching each of them that doing for others was “the way to live life,” Breen, a devout Catholic, led by example. “To us success is how much you have affected another; it’s the foundation of what you do.” Breen died June 30 at 90. Born just a few years before the start of the Great Depression, in 1924, she was adopted by Ivetta and Henry Dielmann when her birth family was unable to support her. Henry Dielmann, an assistant city attorney who served in the Texas House of Representatives for three terms, also was the first dean of St. Mary’s University Law School. “She thought the sun rose and set on her father,” Breen’s daughter Cathy Mellgren said. Educated in Catholic schools, Breen graduated from St. Mary’s High School in 1941, enrolling at what was then Our Lady of the Lake College before withdrawing at the start of World War II to work for the Bell system as a telephone operator. As her brothers and friends went off to war, Breen decided to join the Navy, becoming a WAVE, or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, serving at Alameda Naval Air Station in California after training in government communications at the Pentagon. Returning to San Antonio after her discharge, Breen again enrolled at Our Lady of the Lake before marrying her high school sweetheart in 1947.

    "DiffbotBody": "The “Me” of the title is Greg, through whom the story is told. As played by Thomas Mann, Greg is a fascinating mix — witty and clever, with a subterranean self-esteem and an elaborate strategy for surviving high school in spite of it. His idea is to be mildly friendly to everyone and engage with no one, except Earl (RJ Cyler), with whom he makes a series of short films. He never refers to Earl as his friend but as his business partner. The friendship with Rachel is forced on him. His mother is friends with her mother, and when the word comes that Rachel is sick, his mother insists that he go to see her. Rachel doesn’t want to be visited, and Greg has nothing to say to her, but gradually they find they have things in common — an arch sense of humor, an appreciation of art, an outsider’s angle on things.

Rauner vetoes pay raises for state lawmakers SPRINGFIELD — Illinois lawmakers spent the first day of the state’s new fiscal year largely accusing each other of playing politics with the budget impasse and pointing fingers at who is to blame for it. At the end of the day Wednesday, the state was no closer to passing a permanent state budget, and even a partial, one-month budget was left in limbo. With just Democratic votes, the Senate approved the temporary budget plan that Democrats said would ensure that “essential” state services will continue to be funded in July. However, the House fell short of the supermajority needed to pass the temporary budget. The House took up an identical but separate bill from the one the Senate approved. Under General Assembly rules, the House can’t take up the Senate budget bill until next week at the earliest. Even then, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has threatened to veto any temporary spending bill sent to his desk. The House is scheduled to return to Springfield on Wednesday. The Senate won’t return until July 14, the day before the first state employee paychecks of the new budget year are scheduled to be issued. Attorney General Lisa Madigan has said the paychecks cannot be issued without a budget authorizing them. Democrats said the temporary budget would ensure that key state operations can continue while lawmakers try to reach agreement on a permanent spending plan. “This is about public safety and vulnerable populations,” said Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, D-Chicago. “Do you want to shut it down? Do you want to stop Illinois government from operating for the people?” Currie said objections to the temporary budget plan raised by Republicans were “red herrings.” Republicans in both the House and Senate said the temporary budget was just a shortened version of the $36 billion spending plan Democrats passed in May. Rauner vetoed most of that budget because it spends up to $4 billion more than state tax collections. “This puts us on a path to spend $36 billion when we only have $32 billion,” said Sen. Matt Murphy, R-Palatine. “It puts us on a path to a tax increase without any reforms.” The temporary budget includes money for Medicaid payments and a variety of other human services programs. It also includes money to pay prison guards and state troopers. “State police officers and corrections officers should never be asked to be volunteers,” said Sen. Andy Manar, D-Bunker Hill. However, Murphy said some human services spending in the bill would continue anyway because of court orders. He also noted that prison guards and state troopers have never stayed away from work because of budget impasses. » Comment or view comments",

However, the House fell short of the supermajority needed to pass the temporary budget. The House took up an identical but separate bill from the one the Senate approved. Under General Assembly rules, the House can’t take up the Senate budget bill until next week at the earliest. Even then, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has threatened to veto any temporary spending bill sent to his desk. The House is scheduled to return to Springfield on Wednesday. The Senate won’t return until July 14, the day before the first state employee paychecks of the new budget year are scheduled to be issued. Attorney General Lisa Madigan has said the paychecks cannot be issued without a budget authorizing them. Democrats said the temporary budget would ensure that key state operations can continue while lawmakers try to reach agreement on a permanent spending plan. “This is about public safety and vulnerable populations,” said Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, D-Chicago. “Do you want to shut it down? Do you want to stop Illinois government from operating for the people?” Currie said objections to the temporary budget plan raised by Republicans were “red herrings.” Republicans in both the House and Senate said the temporary budget was just a shortened version of the $36 billion spending plan Democrats passed in May. Rauner vetoed most of that budget because it spends up to $4 billion more than state tax collections. “This puts us on a path to spend $36 billion when we only have $32 billion,” said Sen. Matt Murphy, R-Palatine. “It puts us on a path to a tax increase without any reforms.” The temporary budget includes money for Medicaid payments and a variety of other human services programs. It also includes money to pay prison guards and state troopers. “State police officers and corrections officers should never be asked to be volunteers,” said Sen. Andy Manar, D-Bunker Hill. However, Murphy said some human services spending in the bill would continue anyway because of court orders. He also noted that prison guards and state troopers have never stayed away from work because of budget impasses. The Senate approved the plan on a 37-0-11 vote. Only Democrats, including Manar and Sen. John Sullivan of Rushville, voted for it. Republicans either didn’t vote or voted “present.” Sen. Bill Brady, R-Bloomington, voted “present,” while Sen. Sam McCann, R-Pleasant View, did not vote. In the House, the temporary budget needed 71 votes to pass, but it got only 67. Only Democrats, including Sue Scherer of Decatur, voted for the bill. With one exception, Republicans either voted “present” or did not vote. Area Republican Reps. Tim Butler and Raymond Poe of Springfield and C.D. Davidsmeyer of Jacksonville voted “present.” Republican Rep. Avery Bourne of Pawnee did not vote. Butler released a statement saying that while he supports temporary funding of state government, the bill before the House was “not a genuine proposal to fund state operations.” “It does not actually fund the salaries of staff to carry out the few programs chosen by (House Speaker Michael Madigan) to be funded,” he said. “On top of that, this proposal could very possibly create severe cuts to other programs not outlined in the bill.” Madigan issued his own statement blaming Rauner for an impending government shutdown. Madigan said he will continue to work to pass the temporary spending plan. A House committee is scheduled to take up the Senate version next week. Rauner continues to press lawmakers to approve workers’ compensation changes, liability lawsuit reforms, a property tax freeze, political redistricting reform and term limits before he will discuss tax hikes to help balance the budget. Rauner said those items will make Illinois more competitive and create jobs.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A client who walks into Maureen and Dan Crimmins' wealth management firm won't get the hard sell to purchase a college savings plan from their office. In fact, the Crimmins say their clients won't get any sell at all. Instead, the couple, who operate a fee-only financial advisory firm in New Jersey, like to direct clients to investment vehicles they can purchase and manage on their own. College savers looking to open tax-advantaged accounts known as 529 plans have two choices: direct-sold plans, where they open the plan themselves and choose their own investment options, and advisor-sold plans, distributed through financial advisors. \"We usually really stress the self-directed 529 plans that the states offer,\" says Maureen Crimmins. \"There's so many to choose from and there are really good products out there that have low fees. You kind of set it up and leave it alone and have it grow.\" [Ask these four questions before opening a 529 plan.] Yet many investors choose to work with financial advisors. Advisor-sold plans make up about 48 percent of the market share, according to a recent report from investment research firm Morningstar. Here are some pros and cons to using an advisor. Pro: An advisor can help complete the financial picture. A financial advisor can help an investor with college savings, retirement accounts, estate planning and other goals, says Crimmins. In addition, 529 plans aren't the only option for college savings, and an advisor could direct a client to a lesser-known vehicle such as a Coverdell Education Savings Account or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act account. \"No client is the same,\" says Crimmins. \"Everyone is different. Everyone has a different financial picture that we try to get a good grasp of. There are different vehicles. There are different ways to make sure they're doing the best they can.\" [Discover three myths about college savings plans sold by brokers.] Still, that doesn't mean a college saver needs to purchase a plan from that advisor. Fee-only financial planners are required to act in the best interest of a client, and are not driven by a specific product. Con: Advisor-sold plans are more expensive. The average advisor-sold plan costs investors 1.36 percent a year, compared with 0.43 percent for direct-sold plans, according to Morningstar. Those additional fees can eat away at returns and negate any advantages that a financial advisor might bring, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, a website with information about paying for college. \"The key here is to avoid those higher fees,\" he says. \"Maybe your gross return isn't as good (with direct-sold plans), but your net return will be better. And that's what fundamentally matters.\" [Learn how to minimize four potential drawbacks of 529 plans.] He recommends investing in funds where the fees are less than 1 percent. Some advisors who earn a commission may also recommend plans that will pay them the most, not necessarily those in the college saver's best financial interest. \"You don't want your investment advisor to be steering you to the plans that benefit him as opposed to benefiting you,\" Kantrowitz says. Pro: Advisor-sold plans offer more options for investors. According to Morningstar, plans sold by advisors typically provide about double the \"static\" options, meaning portfolios that do not automatically change their mix of stocks, bonds and other assets as the beneficiary ages. The idea is that a professional advisor could customize the plan, making investment choices that take into account the investor's total portfolio, not just what's going into the 529, says Leo Acheson, analyst at Morningstar. However, investors should keep in mind that the IRS only allows them to make changes to their 529 investment holdings twice a year. Con: It's not \"rocket science.\" Over a 17- or 18-year time period for college savings, active management is not necessary, Kantrowitz says, and may not be advantageous. Being in an age-based plan – which typically starts out with a more aggressive mix of assets and becomes more conservative over time – can be more beneficial in the long run, he says. \"Most investment advisors will not beat consistently, year in and year out, broad stock market indices,\" he says. \"You may have an investment advisor beating averages for a couple years, but you're not going to do it for 17 years consistently.\" Investment advisors can be good for coordinating an entire portfolio of investments and for meeting goals, but opening a direct-sold 529 plan \"isn't rocket science,\" he says.

And then even more likely rank higher on my board than NFL teams’. The third day of the draft always features talent, but either it is not recognized or a certain role is not appreciated enough. Also, many top athletes who lack refinement are selected on the third day. If players near the top of this list are still available in rounds six and seven they were likely removed from numerous boards due to medical or character. Best Available (overall ranking in parenthesis) Undrafted is a real possibility. Where He Wins: Length and strength compensates for deficiencies in other areas. Gets to the second level very well and looks to maul. Does not get the credit he deserves in terms of mobility and functional athleticism. Will have one or three bad snaps per game, but luck partially determines impact. He can absolutely play left tackle. Where He Wins: Added 16 pounds for the Combine and still showed great movement skills. Added weight was due to travel schedule. Is so quick to beat reach blocks or win the leverage advantage, then transitions to using speed and balance. Holds up well against the run as well. Can play both the 1 technique and 3 technique. Knee concerns seem to be real, at least for some teams. Third day likely where teams who “dropped his grade” will target. Where He Wins: A very unique back for his size. Ajayi is very fluid and can really create yards in the open field. He has straight line speed and flashes beating contact against smaller defenders. Other times, Ajayi goes down easily and fails to locate holes behind the line of scrimmage. Ajayi would thrive in a Matt Forte/Marc Trestman receiving back role. Where He Wins: We all have our bias, and Cobb is my type of running back: always falling forward for a few extra yards or beating contact in the backfield to create positive yards. One speed runner but comfortable in trash or in space. Has a nice foundation as a receiving back. Where He Wins: Length and strength. As Lance Zierlein said, he has the level of ability to be a starting tackle. Is it inexperience or rawness that is causing him to not trust his feet or not utilize an inside armbar to prevent lateral moves? Where He Wins: I believe McBride develops into a nice No. 2 option for a team. He creates separation in his routes with precision and quickness. He also wins in contested situations. The top Shrine prospect heading into the week and the top one exiting. Where He Wins: Plenty of quickness and upfield explosion in Bennett’s game. Played both 1 and 3 techniques, but likely fits the latter better. Will have a role in sub-package or downs that lend themselves to rushing the passer. Where He Wins: Slot receiver in college likely projects to the same spot in the NFL, but flashed outside ability at the Senior Bowl. Route runner with agility and some quickness on short and intermediate routes. Little wasted movement after the catch to get upfield. Where He Wins: Extremely reliable to create separation with precision, hesitation and little wasted movement in his breaks. Do not ask him to consistently win in contested situations. Slot projection makes the most sense, but played outside quite a bit too. 10. (57) C/G Shaq Mason, Georgia Tech Where He Wins: A complete mauler in the running game. Creates lanes in one on one situations. Finisher with athleticism and explosion. Question is about pass pro: is he raw or just inexperienced. Will improvement just come with reps? 16. (80) WR Damarr Aultman, Maine",

As Lance Zierlein said, he has the level of ability to be a starting tackle. Is it inexperience or rawness that is causing him to not trust his feet or not utilize an inside armbar to prevent lateral moves? 6. (49) WR Tre McBride, William \u0026 Mary. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 85.3) Where He Wins: I believe McBride develops into a nice No. 2 option for a team. He creates separation in his routes with precision and quickness. He also wins in contested situations. The top Shrine prospect heading into the week and the top one exiting. (SPARQ%: 63) Where He Wins: Plenty of quickness and upfield explosion in Bennett’s game. Played both 1 and 3 techniques, but likely fits the latter better. Will have a role in sub-package or downs that lend themselves to rushing the passer. (Age: 23) (SPARQ%: 27.6) Where He Wins: Slot receiver in college likely projects to the same spot in the NFL, but flashed outside ability at the Senior Bowl. Route runner with agility and some quickness on short and intermediate routes. Little wasted movement after the catch to get upfield. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 29.9) Where He Wins: Extremely reliable to create separation with precision, hesitation and little wasted movement in his breaks. Do not ask him to consistently win in contested situations. Slot projection makes the most sense, but played outside quite a bit too. 10. (57) C/G Shaq Mason, Georgia Tech. (SPARQ%: 78.7) Where He Wins: A complete mauler in the running game. Creates lanes in one on one situations. Finisher with athleticism and explosion. Question is about pass pro: is he raw or just inexperienced. Will improvement just come with reps? 11. (59) G Tre Jackson, FSU. (SPARQ%: 16.3) 12. (68) RB Mike Davis, South Carolina. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 48.5) (SPARQ%: 77.8) (SPARQ%: 29.2) (SPARQ%: 41.6) 16. (80) WR Damarr Aultman, Maine. (SPARQ%: 95.5) (Age: 21) (SPARQ%: 33.2) (SPARQ%: 92.3) (SPARQ%: N/A) (SPARQ%: 65.9) (SPARQ%: 19.2) (SPARQ%: 87.3) (Age: 21) (SPARQ%: 63.8) (SPARQ%: 62.9) (SPARQ%: 84) 26. (101) TE Ben Koyack, Notre Dame. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 11.1) (SPARQ%: 1.3) (SPARQ%: 53.3) (SPARQ%: 14.8) (SPARQ%: 73.6) 31. (107) WR Kenny Bell, Nebraska. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 92.2) 32. (108) WR Tony Lippett, Michigan State. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 15.2) 33. (109) EDGE/DL Marcus Hardison, Arizona State. (SPARQ%: 63) (SPARQ%: 73.2) 35. (111) WR Dezmin Lewis, Central Arkansas. (Age: 22) (SPARQ%: 62.9) (SPARQ%: 77.8) (SPARQ%: 95.7) 38. (118) LB Mike Hull, Penn State. (SPARQ%: 47.6) (SPARQ%: 67.5) 40. (124) EDGE Marcus Rush, Michigan State. (SPARQ%: 74.2) There are so many different reasons why these prospects are still on the board. Some still have questions around their makeup. Others have questions around their evaluation. And then even more likely rank higher on my board than NFL teams’. The third day of the draft always features talent, but either it is not recognized or a certain role is not appreciated enough. Also, many top athletes who lack refinement are selected on the third day. If players near the top of this list are still available in rounds six and seven they were likely removed from numerous boards due to medical or character. Best Available (overall ranking in parenthesis) (SPARQ%: 25.3) Undrafted is a real possibility. Where He Wins: Length and strength compensates for deficiencies in other areas. Gets to the second level very well and looks to maul. Does not get the credit he deserves in terms of mobility and functional athleticism. Will have one or three bad snaps per game, but luck partially determines impact. He can absolutely play left tackle. (SPARQ%: 86.7) Where He Wins: Added 16 pounds for the Combine and still showed great movement skills. Added weight was due to travel schedule. Is so quick to beat reach blocks or win the leverage advantage, then transitions to using speed and balance. Holds up well against the run as well. Can play both the 1 technique and 3 technique. 3. (35) RB Jay Ajayi, Boise State. (Age: 21) (SPARQ%: 69.2) Knee concerns seem to be real, at least for some teams. Third day likely where teams who “dropped his grade” will target. Where He Wins: A very unique back for his size. Ajayi is very fluid and can really create yards in the open field. He has straight line speed and flashes beating contact against smaller defenders. Other times, Ajayi goes down easily and fails to locate holes behind the line of scrimmage. Ajayi would thrive in a Matt Forte/Marc Trestman receiving back role. 4. (36) RB David Cobb, Minnesota. (Age: 21) (SPARQ%: 27.3) Where He Wins: We all have our bias, and Cobb is my type of running back: always falling forward for a few extra yards or beating contact in the backfield to create positive yards. One speed runner but comfortable in trash or in space. Has a nice foundation as a receiving back. (SPARQ%: 69) Where He Wins: Length and strength.

    "DiffbotBody": "COLUMBIA, S.C.—It took mere seconds to lower the Confederate battle flag for a final time on South Carolina’s Statehouse grounds Friday morning, a quick and muted end to a decadeslong furor. A crowd of thousands cheered and sang as the flag was lowered down the 30-foot pole. State troopers in gray uniforms and white gloves carefully folded and furled the square banner, bound it with white string and marched it to the Statehouse steps. They handed the flag to an archivist, who transported it to the state museum, where it will be ensconced in the Confederate Relic Room. The removal of the flag marks the end of an era in South Carolina, where the flag has been a perennial political issue and a reminder of racial division. But debate over Confederate symbols and their role in history and in the public continue in the state and across the nation. Calls to remove the Confederate battle symbol from the Mississippi state flag have divided leaders in that state. Fights over the rebel flag resonated in the halls of Congress this week. Michael Mathis brought his 5-year-old granddaughter Ryleigh to see the flag come down from the Confederate Soldier Monument, just as he brought her mother, Brianna, in 2000 when another Confederate flag was removed from the dome. “It means a way ahead, not just for me, but for her future,” said Mr. Mathis, a 52-year-old retired U.S. Army command sergeant major. Ryleigh wore a T-shirt with an American flag. “This is why I served,” Mr. Mathis said. “Freedom for everyone. We have one people now.” Crowds began to form hours before the ceremony, seeking shade on the leafy Capitol grounds, sitting on coolers and waving fans. Sisters Tonya Davis, 49, and Sabrina Jackson, 52, left Charlotte, N.C., with their children at 6:30 a.m. to get a parking space and a good vantage point. “It’s starting to heal old wounds,” Ms. Davis said. “Stuff your parents and ancestors died before seeing, or even hoping to see.” Many people waved American flags and a smaller number of people waved Confederate ones. As the troopers took down the flag, some chanted, “U.S.A.!” Others sang the chorus to “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye,” and some sang the refrain from “Amazing Grace.” Bill Feus and his 15-year-old son William of Fort Mill, S.C., were among a dozen or so Confederate re-enactors at the ceremony dressed in period clothes. Mr. Feus wore the tan layered uniform of the Army of Tennessee and William wore the blue woolen uniform of the Army of Northern Virginia. They said the day was bittersweet. “I can understand how the Confederate flag has been hijacked by hate groups,” Mr. Feus said. “But it also represents the flag my kin fought and died under…It’s in my blood in a way.” Mr. Feus, an Episcopal priest, said the flag coming down will be a good thing only if it leads to “true reconciliation,” which is yet to be seen. It is unclear what happens next for the flag. The debate on its removal took place over three short weeks, prompted by the June 17 slayings of Sen. Clementa Pinckney, a black pastor, and eight other church members at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. A white man, Dylann Roof, has been charged with nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder; he was commonly photographed with the Confederate flag and police say he intended to incite a race war. Gov. Nikki Haley called for the flag to come down on June 22, and called the legislature back to town for debate. The focus was on bringing the flag down, more than where to put it, and late concerns about the flag’s destination nearly derailed the bill’s passage in the House on Wednesday. Flag backers sought assurance the flag would be part of an “appropriate, permanent and public display,” and reached agreement that the relic room would provide a plan for the display by January. Then the legislature would decide how to fund the display when it reconvenes. Democrats said they support a suitable display for the flag, anywhere except on a flagpole, as some white Republicans have sought. “That flag does not need to fly,” said Rep. Justin Bamberg, who is black. Ms. Haley posted on social media a picture, taken from behind, as she and her husband gazed at the flag just before it came down. “It’s a new day in South Carolina,” the post said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Apocalypse | Adventure Combat Ops | June 29, 2015 I never played Resident Evil, because I watched someone play it once and that was terrifying enough. But on Monday afternoon, I found myself in a 3D derivative, the immersive attraction known as the Apocalypse inside the brand-new Adventure Combat Ops. A zombie materialized from the floor and went straight for my ankles. I think I unloaded an entire magazine of Airsoft pellets at the poor actor, and sweat through my shirt. But the exhilarating fun wasn’t the most memorable thing about the day. It was being in a combat simulation with men who have survived the real thing many times over. Elite veterans of special ops forces across the U.S. military are your guides inside this world, and while they’re playing roles, they’re also being themselves. It’s funny that in a setting so unreal, operatives trained to be invisible could become a little more real. Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana, Imogene Wolodarsky. Directed by Maya Forbes. Rated R. Opens Friday. Around the time that his buddy and frequent collaborator Adam Sandler signed a multi-film, multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix, David Spade announced that he’d be making a sequel to his 2001 comedy Joe Dirt as an original movie for the free VOD service Crackle, and Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser plays like an even cheaper, lazier version of a typical Sandler movie. The slapdash plot finds mulleted redneck Joe Dirt (Spade) traveling back in time via a Wizard of Oz-style tornado, although the production is so barebones that its past looks suspiciously like the present. Most of the original supporting cast returns, but they all seem vaguely confused as to what they’re doing there. Spade and co-writer/director Fred Wolf beat every feeble joke into the ground, and the plot drags on interminably only to end up in the exact same place it started. You’d think that after 14 years, they’d have more than stale fart jokes and weak callbacks to bits that weren’t funny in the first place.",

CNN rallied behind Gupta, saying he had the network's support and that it was proud of his or.Gupta has our \"full and unequivocal support,\" CNN said in a statement. \"As we reported, he assisted the surgeons at Bir Hospital by performing a craniotomy on a young victim,\" the network said.\"Some reporting has suggested it was not the young girl we, at the time of our own reporting in the midst of the crisis, believed her to be. We will try to verify that.\" It said Gupta had spent a week in Nepal, \"helped save a young life in the operating room, and we couldn't be prouder of him.\"Gupta's medical assistance, particularly in disaster zones, is sometimes shown on the network’s newscasts.CNN had provided video to Global Press Journal more than a week ago that showed Gupta's role in the surgery, contradicting the initial claim that he hadn't helped at all.\"He was, if anything, relatively modest on the air in characterising his own role. He simply appears to have been fundamentally wrong about the identity of his patient,\" said NPR's David Folkenflik, who was informed of the journal's reporting ahead of time.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Full disclosure: we never thought much about becoming professional golfers. That’s not to say we had the necessary skill to be a dominant force on the tour, but however you want to slice it, we simply never had the head for golf. After seeing what some of these guys pull in, though, boy do we regret not giving this game a go. Not every golfer on the planet is making as much as the world’s highest-paid athletes, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’re slumming it. According to Forbes, “The top 10 golfers earned an estimated total of $271 million in prize money, appearances, endorsements and golf course design fees between June 1, 2014 and June 1, 2015.” If you’ve ever tried to master the sport of golf, you understand why these athletes are making a pretty good living. The fact is, golf is hard. It’s all about muscle memory, mental fortitude, and focus. Some people have it, some don’t, and some simply stand above the rest. Who are these athletes? Luckily for us, Forbes did all the hard work. We’re just here to give you what you need. With that in mind — discounting the highest-paid retired athletes — here’s a look at the five highest-paid golfers in 2015. 5. Jordan Spieth Total earnings: $19.8 million Salary/winnings: $8.8 million Endorsements: $11 million Golf aficionados knew that Jordan Spieth could play the game at the highest level, but it wasn’t until his record-tying performance at The Masters this year that the rest of the world finally caught up to his star power. When the 21-year-old from Dallas shot an 18-under 270 at Augusta National — in a coast-to-coast victory — to capture his first green jacket, you knew the money would soon follow. In 12 months, Spieth has pulled in $19.8 million in total earnings. He’s racked up $8.8 million from his winnings — $1.8 million from The Masters alone — and made a solid $11 million in endorsements. Aside from a deal with Under Armour that runs through 2025, Forbes reports that the No. 2 golfer in the world also has partnerships with AT\u0026T, Titleist and Rolex. 4. Justin Rose Total earnings: $20.2 million Salary/winnings: $8.2 million Endorsements: $12 million As the No. 5 golfer in the world, England’s Justin Rose has parlayed his success on the course into great wealth off of it. In the past 12 months, the 2013 U.S. Open Champion has made $12 million in endorsements, courtesy of his partnerships with companies such as Adidas, Ashworth, British Airways, Hublot, Lamkin, TaylorMade and Zurich Insurance. In the last year, Rose has also brought in $8.2 million from his winnings. The 2015 PGA Tour season has certainly been kind to this talented golfer. So far in 2015, in 11 events, Rose has three top 10 finishes, a second place finish, and a victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. Rose has finished inside the top 6 in the year-end golf rankings in each of the past three seasons. Given how well he’s been playing, we expect that trend to continue. 2. Tiger Woods Total Earnings: $50.6 million Salary/Winnings: $600,000 Endorsements: $50 million Tiger Woods’s struggles on the golf course — only making $600,000 from winnings in the past 12 months — have played a major part in him dropping to No. 2 on the list of highest-paid golfers. And yet, despite his current lack of game, nothing seems to prevent the 14-time Majors champion from raking in the big bucks. In the last year, Tiger has brought in added $50 million to his purse in endorsement money alone. Nike still keeps Woods living large, to the tune of over $20 million a year, but the apparel giant isn’t the only brand that keeps itself in the Tiger Woods business. In 2014, Woods signed deals with companies such as MusclePharm and India’s Hero motorcycles. If you throw in the fact that Tiger is starting to make some money off his golf course-design firm, then it’s easy that while Woods may have 99 problems, money is certainly not one. 1. Phil Mickelson Total Earnings: $50.8 million Salary/Winnings: $2.8 million Endorsements: $48 million Put your hands together and break out the golf for the lefty. With a whopping $50.8 million earned in the past year, Phil Mickelson has usurped Woods on the Forbes list of highest-paid golfers. Since becoming a pro in 1992, Mickelson has accumulated $77 million in total prize money. This past year he only brought in $2.8 million from his play on the course. However, it’s the $48 million is raked in from endorsement deals, that put Mickelson over the top. According to Forbes, “Lefty” pulls in this kind of dough from his association with companies such as Callaway, Barclays, KPMG, Exxon Mobil, Rolex and Amgen. Not bad for a guy who hasn’t won a tournament since 2013. Still, when you take into account that Mickelson has 42 PGA wins and five Majors in his career, it’s no surprise that he continues to be one of the most popular guys on the tour. The $600 million he’s made during his career from prize money, appearances, and endorsements are still second in comparison to Tiger’s overall haul. However, as long as we choose to focus on earnings from the past 12 months, Phil Mickelson is second to none.

    "DiffbotBody": "Uber and Lyft have taken to prices slashes in Manhattan as they continue to fight. The battleground of the ride-hailing war has now moved from San Francisco to Manhattan. On Friday, bitter rivals Uber and Lyft, both of which offer on-demand rides with the tap of a mobile app, announced price slashes to their carpooling services in Manhattan. So, if you’re looking for a ride and don’t want to grab a taxi, here are your options: UberPool: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan, as long as it starts and ends south of 96th Street, and it will cost $10 at most (or less if the distance doesn’t reach $10 per Uber’s fare math), and regardless of whether you get matched to carpool with another rider. Uber says this is for a limited time, so keep an eye out for announcements in case it changes. Lyft Line: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan as long as it starts and ends south of 97th Street (note the extra block), and it will cost only $5 even if you’re not matched with another carpooler. The catch is that this only works for one rider. If you are with a friend, you will be charged $1 dollar for both of you to get into the car. Gett: This Israeli car service contender has been quieter than Uber and Lyft, but it’s been offering $10 rides anywhere in Manhattan south of 110th Street since last September. Oh, and you don’t have to carpool and you get to ride in a fancy black car. Uber and Lyft have been running this playbook in San Francisco for several months now, and prices have fluctuated. Manhattanites should expect these deals to be temporary. New York’s city council is also expected to consider a proposal that would halt these services’ expansion by capping the number of cars they can add every year, so any of the above could be affected. Lyft recently agreed to pay $300,000 to settle a city complaint. At least New York still has a pretty good subway system…",

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Who is the best player in the ? Not based on the last 10 years or one game, but over the last year: Who was the best? Good luck answering that one without starting a fight, right? Well, that's what the NFL 1000 aims to do by scouting, grading and then ranking the best players at each position before putting them in order and breaking ties to come up with the top 1,000 players. No narratives, no fantasy football points, no quarterback rating: This is cold, hard scouting. You can find rankings for all other positions on our B/R NFL 1000 main page. The B/R 1000 metric is based heavily on scouting each player and grading the key criteria for each position. The criteria are weighed according to importance for a possible best score of 100. Potential is not taken into consideration, nor are career accomplishments. Cornerbacks have many responsibilities—and those vary depending on the individual scheme. With that in mind, we graded them on run defense (10 points), coverage (75) and tackling (10), plus five points for their value as a starter or backup. In that category, we're looking at whether the player is a consistent starter, a spot starter, a top-level backup or simply a backup-only player. In the case of ties, our team asked, \"Which player would I rather have on my team?\" and set the rankings accordingly. Subjective? Yes. But ties are no fun. Each player was scouted by me and a team of experienced evaluators (Dan Bazal, Cian Fahey, Dan Hope, Marshal Miller, Justis Mosqueda) with these key criteria in mind. The following scouting reports and grades are the work of months of film study from our team. Players' heights, weights, seasons played and coverage stats from NFL.com unless otherwise noted. All other statistics from Pro Football Focus. Begin Slideshow » Coverage: 51/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 5/5 Greg Toler (6'0\", 190 lbs, 5 seasons) has big potential and has flashed top-tier talent at times, but he was far too inconsistent in 2014 as both a cover man and a tackler. On the ground, he saw 14 of his tackle attempts go for naught—a number that puts a huge damper on his run and tackle scores. In coverage, Toler played largely in man schemes while allowing nine touchdowns and letting 56 percent of attempts thrown his way go for a completion. Coverage: 53/75; Run Defense: 5/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 4/5 Coming off the best season of his career in 2013, Will Blackmon (6’0”, 204 lbs, 8 seasons) crashed back down to earth with a rough 2014 campaign. Working as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ slot cornerback for their first eight games, Blackmon was picked on in coverage and did not record a single pass deflection. After missing the second half of the season with a broken finger, Blackmon was released by the Jaguars this offseason. He was picked up by the Seattle Seahawks, where he is competing to be their slot cornerback, but the injury-prone 30-year-old is truly best suited for playing on special teams. Coverage: 56/75; Run Defense: 2/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 Melvin White (6’1”, 215 lbs, 2 seasons) began the 2014 season as a starter for the Carolina Panthers but lost playing time over the course of the year due to poor performance. A big but slow cornerback, White makes some plays on the ball with his length but does not play with enough physicality or fluidity to make up for his athletic shortcomings. He is inconsistent both in coverage and as a tackler and does not make the impact a cornerback of his size should in run defense. Coverage: 52/75; Run Defense: 6/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 At one point, Robert McClain (5’9”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) looked set to be one of the better slot cornerbacks in the NFL. However, his performances since that point have dropped off significantly. McClain struggles with his footwork, something that is a major issue for cornerbacks who play inside, and he can’t make up for that with length or ball skills. While he is a good run defender in terms of reacting to plays and aggressively forcing his way to ball-carriers, he must become a better tackler to truly show value there. Coverage: 55/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 5/10; Starter: 3/5 Chris Owens (5’9”, 180 lbs, 6 seasons) is one of many players across the NFL who is immediately thought of as a good slot cornerback simply because of his size. It’s true that Owens had proved to be adequate in the past, but his skill set doesn’t allow him to handle the two-way game that comes with playing inside. Owens doesn’t have the foot speed or balance to consistently contain the faster inside receivers in the NFL, which showed during the 2014 season. Coverage: 57/75; Run Defense: 4/10; Tackling: 2/10; Starter: 3/5 While Cassius Vaughn (5’11”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) has good long speed, he is slow coming out of his stance and flipping his hips, which enables receivers to beat him off the line frequently. He does not play physically and is a poor tackler. After one unimpressive season with the Detroit Lions, Vaughn signed this offseason with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he will have to fight just to make the 53-man roster.",

Deveaux delivered a two-handed slash to the ankle of defenceman Per Helmersson during the pre-game warm-up of a Swedish professional hockey league game. (Richard Wolowicz/Getty Images) Former Toronto Maple Leafs enforcer Andre Deveaux has been exonerated by Swedish authorities for his attack on an opposing player earlier this year. Prosecutors had considered charging Deveaux after he delivered a two-handed slash to the ankle of defenceman Per Helmersson during the pre-game warm-up of a Swedish professional hockey league game. 'I was always confident that this investigation would go nowhere.

He said he was simply protecting himself when he took the action he did. \"I was always confident that this investigation would go nowhere,\" said Deveaux. \"It was unwarranted, particularly given the facts. I now look forward to Rogle BK living up to their obligations. \"My wife, Anya, and I are grateful for the outpouring of support we have received in Canada.\" Helmersson had checked Deveaux into the boards from behind in the previous game between the two teams, resulting in Deveaux sustaining a concussion. No penalty was called on the play. The Swedish Ice Hockey Association suspended Deveaux until Feb. 15, 2016, a decision he is appealing. Deveaux has spent most of his career in the minors. In 31 NHL games for Toronto and the New York Rangers, he recorded zero goals, two assists and 104 penalty minutes. In just 20 games with Rogle, he collected 67 penalty minutes, along with six goals and three assists.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Growing up in Turkey in the 1990s, the whole live music scene was dominated by cover bands that played hits from the United States and Europe. It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. But when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was. So I went back and listened to them—and was blown away. Listen to a playlist featuring Turkish artists covered in this story: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the music scene in Turkey flourished, producing local legends including Erkin Koray and Selda Bağcan. But a military coup in 1980 put a definite hold on the arts. There was not much happening besides pop music for a while, but a strong metal scene appeared in the ‘90s, including bands which formed the base for long running acts like Replikas, Nekropsi, and Daire 2: General Gramafon. The Internet then spurred on a new wave of vibrancy within the country's music scene, and underground musicians started to embrace their own roots and write their lyrics in Turkish. Peyote, a music venue located in the heart of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, became the first venue to exclusively book bands with original music, giving way to a healthy artistic community. Musicians in Turkey still face drawbacks on a daily basis: There are still only a handful of venues that host non-cover bands, with bigger venues only booking foreign acts (and not offering local groups support slots), and lots of music festivals have been cancelled due to new government regulations that prevent alcohol sponsorships. But these obstacles have brought bands together as they collectively work to book shows, open DIY venues, and do their own street festivals. Members of Istanbul’s music scene outside Roxy, one of the city's oldest venues for rock shows There are only a few cities in Turkey with music venues, and getting visas to play shows in Europe can be difficult, so touring is not really an option for most underground bands. But the economic inviability of making a living entirely from music—as well as the diminished chances of any type of rock stardom—has effectively eliminated certain types of musicians, leaving behind only the ones who are 100% dedicated to what they do. Right now, despite all the roadblocks in the way, there is an incredibly lively DIY music scene in Turkey, filled with talented musicians. I asked nearly 20 of these artists to take me where they feel at home in Istanbul and talked to them about the current state of the music scene. The journey led me through rehearsal spaces and tea gardens, alleyways and festive feasts.",

Every year, around 15 dogs jump to their death, the only known example of dog suicide. 7.

    "DiffbotBody": "'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Tuesday, July 7, 2015, 9:00 p.m. I love grilling vegetables because doing so concentrates their natural sugars and amps up their flavor. During the summer, the usual suspects are zucchini, eggplant, onions, peppers and corn. They're all delicious this way and — Bonus! — they all become tender in an agreeably short amount of time. But it recently occurred to me that a number of the veggies I love roasting in the oven — broccoli, cauliflower and carrots — might also shine if cooked on the grill. Turns out, they do! The first problem was to figure out how to cut these vegetables so they wouldn't fall through the slats of the grill grates. The solution was to keep them in big pieces; I cut the carrots in half lengthwise, left the broccoli attached at the stalk, and sliced the cauliflower head straight down into half-inch cutlets (or “steaks”). These precautions kept the vegetables from falling into the flames, which allowed me to discover that it took forever for them to become tender. To speed up the process, I started by blanching them. After this quick bath in boiling water, I popped the vegetables in ice water to stop the cooking, then made sure they were dry before oiling, seasoning and grilling. Suddenly, these guys took no time at all to get tender. And they browned nicely along the way. Yay! Also, sure enough, their flavor became concentrated, just as it does when roasted. Indeed, it was assertive enough to pair up with a tahini sauce and spicy panko crumbs. When the vegetables are this robust, you may even decide you don't need the grilled steak. Chef Sara Moulton writes this column for the Associated Press. Grilled Vegetables With Tahini Sauce and Spicy Panko Start to finish: 1 hour 1⁄4 cup tahini, well stirred 2 1⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons water, plus more if needed for sauce 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt 1⁄2 cup panko bread crumbs 1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper Water for cooking and cooling vegetables Ice 1 head broccoli, quartered down the center 1 small head cauliflower, sliced into 1⁄2-inch-thick “steaks” 6 large carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise Vegetable or canola oil, for brushing the vegetables Freshly ground black pepper In a medium bowl, stir together the tahini, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the water, lemon juice, garlic and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt. Add additional water if necessary to achieve a pourable consistency. Set aside. In a large skillet over medium, heat the remaining 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the crushed red pepper and a hefty pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the bread crumbs turn golden, for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a grill to medium. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice and water and place it next to the pot. Add the broccoli and cook it for 2 minutes. Use tongs to remove the broccoli from the water and place it in the ice water. Cool it completely, then pat dry with paper towels. Repeat this process with the cauliflower and carrots, cooking the cauliflower for 2 minutes and the carrots for 3 minutes. Brush all of the vegetables well on both sides with vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper and, working in batches if necessary, grill them on direct medium heat, with the grill covered, until they have distinct grill marks on the bottom, for about 5 minutes. Turn them over and grill on the second side until they have distinct grill marks on the second side and are tender, for about another 5 minutes. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, drizzle with the tahini sauce and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.

You've now graduated to fancy cocktail bars, where drink ordering is done in front of a date, coworkers, or possibly even a significant other's parents. And there are plenty of grown-up alternatives to Jack and Coke. But the most important thing is knowing what you want and ordering it with confidence, says Pamela Wiznitzer, creative director at Seamstress, a cocktail bar in New York. “If you want to order a vodka soda in front of your future mother-in-law, don’t question it,” she says. “Don’t feel like you need to go outside of your comfort zone.” For those that do want to expand their alcohol horizons, we’ve rounded up five drinks—one for each of the five major spirits (vodka, gin, rum, tequila, and whiskey)—that go beyond frat boy favorites. The bad news? “You probably won’t be able to order these at dive bars,” says April Wachtel, owner and educator at Swig + Swallow and Craft Mocktails. “But anywhere that has fresh juice should be able to make at least a few of them.” We've even gone ahead and included ingredients and directions—because you're never too old to play bartender. “It’s the most popular cocktail in Mexico,” Wiznitzer says. “Sure, we like our margaritas here in the U.S., but they drink palomas for a reason.” Ingredients: Kosher salt, 2 ounces grapefruit juice, 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice, 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 ounces tequila, 2 ounces club soda, 1 lemon wedge (for garnish) Directions: Pour kosher salt on a plate and rub rim of a highball glass with lemon wedge. Dip rim of glass in salt. Pour grapefruit juice, lime juice, and sugar into glass, and stir until fully dissolved. Add tequila and ice, top off with club soda, and garnish with lemon wedge. “If you ask cocktail bartenders what their top five drinks are, the daiquiri is likely on the list,” Wachtel says. “As long as you use quality ingredients, it's difficult to butcher. However, the daiquiri is similarly difficult to perfect—but we're happy to try.” Ingredients: 2 ounces light rum, 3/4 ounce fresh lime juice, 3/4 ounce simple syrup, 1 lime wedge (for garnish) Directions: Pour ingredients in a mixing glass or tin. Add ice, shake, and strain into a martini glass. Garnish with lime wedge. “This is an absolute classic, and it happens to be very refreshing,” Wiznitzer says. “None of the flavors are too strong or foreign, so it’s a great option for people who are experimenting with new drinks.” Ingredients: 2 ounces gin, 1 ounce fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon superfine sugar, 4 ounces club soda, 1 maraschino cherry (for garnish), 1 lemon wedge (for garnish) Directions: Combine first three ingredients in Collins glass. Stir, add ice, top with club soda, and garnish with maraschino cherry and lemon wedge. “The whiskey smash is a perfect refreshing summer cocktail,” Wachtel says. “It's basically the boozy adult version of a minty lemonade.\" Enough said. Ingredients: 3 lemon wedges, 2 ounces bourbon, 3/4 ounce simple syrup, 8 mint leaves, 1 mint sprig Directions: Muddle lemon wedges in a mixing glass or tin. Add remaining ingredients except mint sprig. Add ice, shake, and double strain into an old fashioned glass over fresh ice. Slap mint sprig gently to release oils, and place in glass.

    "DiffbotBody": "Kandi Burruss Becomes New Face Of RHoA But Can She Bring In The Big Ratings? [PHOTO] Nene Leakes recently decided to quit RHOA which left producers scrambling for a new lead for the hit reality show. So, who is supposed to fill Nene’s size 11 feet?? When RHOA 8 filming starts next month, Kandi Burruss will be the show’s new star. And Kandi’s storyline will anchor the rest of the cast members’ plotlines for the 2015-2016 season, LALATE can exclusively report. Cast and producers are still working on storyline arches for new and returning cast members. But Burruss will be the core of the revamped show. While the NeNe Leakes exit from RHOA might have surprised many yesterday, LALATE has been reporting for two years about this predicted exit. Since RHOA5’s conclusion, producers have anticipated that Leakes will eventually depart the show and the show will have to take a turn direction. As a result, the tail end of RHOA 7 focused more on allegiances gained and broken with Burruss in the final episodes. Burruss remained distanced with Phaedra Parks and suddenly close to Kenya Moore, as the season concluded. Burruss, meantime, found herself unable to ease all tensions. She witnessed progress between Porsha and Cynthia, but saw a breakthrough between Kenya and Phaedra only to be lost thereafter. Burruss has since 2014’s summer claimed her spinoffs have been bigger ratings winners than Leakes’ spinoff. This summer, Kandi’s Ski Trip delivered a moderate 1.6 average ratings share. And when the RHOA 7 Reunion aired, Leakes called Kandi her “new jealous hater”. But with Leakes’ exit, along executive producer Carlos King, many worry if RHOA will be able to retain its average 3.5 ratings share going forward. Kandi Burruss has long claimed that she can draw ratings as good as NeNe Leakes.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The first big surprise of Comic-Con was actually the first thing that happened: Bill Murray showed up. The annual convention kicked off yesterday morning, and the first panel went to Open Road who has a brand new movie coming out, Rock the Kasbah. Bill Murray is in that movie, so he decided to pay Comic-Con a surprise visit, and it was so much of a surprise, even those who were in on the surprise (like, MTV News) didn’t realize it was happening. Murray was supposed to enter from backstage. Instead, he entered from the main hallway and walked right through the crowd of screaming fans. He also took to the stage in character for Rock the Kasbah, where he plays a music manager who discovers a brand new singer in Afghanistan. Sounds like a crazy premise, but if anyone can pull it off, it’s Murray. (Did we mention, our own beloved Zooey Deschanel, is also in the movie? Yeah, it’s going to be amazing.) And once he had full command of the crowd, what did Murray do? Say incredibly Bill Murray things, of course. When asked about where he falls on the Comic Con spectrum, he replied, “Some of the best parties I’ve ever been to have been with really insane nerds,” mentioning one that happened at Skywalker Ranch, aka, where all of Star Wars is housed. Murray then said that he’s “working out now” because he wants to play young Han Solo. That’s not all he said. He also imparted wisdom, mentioning that young performers can “get away with a lot more if you don’t want a writing credit,” and then gushed about Miley Cyrus. “I’m gonna say this officially. Miley Cyrus is a god. I was not particularly convinced, but Miley is really good. She can really sing.” (Cyrus appears in Murray’s upcoming Netflix Christmas special, because it was about time Murray got his own Netflix Christmas special.) Then, he gushed about Zooey saying, “She’s go to sing the pitches and the keys and notes of 14 of the greatest singers in America… her karaoke work would live forever.” Still need more? He told the crowd that he started the morning with “bagels and then some tequila” and mentioned that his favorite role was one where he had to “save the city of New York,” where he had “the coolest damn car to drive around Manhattan.” He’s talking, of course, about Ghostbusters. Basically, the one picture to sum up his entire panel was captured through the facial expressions of our Internet best friend, Jennifer Lawrence, who met him as the Open Road panel switched over to Hunger Games. Before leaving the stage, Murray also told the crowd that he could “do this [panel] forever” so see you back same time, same place next year? If you want to watch the entire panel, YOU CAN, and bask in all the Murray glory. It’ll almost be like you were there, too. (Image via YouTube)",

Demonstrators gathered on the steps of the federal courthouse with permission from authorities, their chanting mixed with speeches in English and Spanish and music from a brass band. Activists criticized Republican resistance to the Obama program and called for policies that let immigrants stay and work in the country. The crowd spilled into a blocked-off street and a nearby park. Organizers said there would be acts of \"civil disobedience.\" Police were seen escorting some away from an intersection near the court building. Police spokesman Frank Robertson said 14 people were issued summonses for obstructing public passages. Inside the courthouse, the judges heard the latest versions of now-familiar arguments, with an attorney for the state of Texas arguing that Obama's program amounted to executive overreach, and an Obama administration attorney saying the executive branch was within its rights in deciding to defer deportation of selected groups of immigrants. Obama announced the plan in November. Republicans in Congress were highly critical and a federal judge in Texas, siding with Texas and 25 other states, issued an injunction, which the Obama administration appealed. It was unclear when the appeals court would rule. A ruling against the administration would further dim prospects of implementation of the executive action before Obama leaves office in 2016. Appeals would take months and, depending on how the case unfolds, it could go back to the Texas federal court for more proceedings. Obama's executive orders were intended to expand a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The other major part, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, would extend deportation protections to parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years. \"All that deferred action confers on an alien is the right to remain here,\" said Benjamin Mizer, an assistant attorney general arguing for the administration. \"It is temporary and revocable.\" Scott Keller, representing the Texas Solicitor General's Office, argued that the administration was doing more than simply deferring action. He said the plan would effectively grant a new legal status — legal presence — to people in the country illegally, putting them in line to get permission to work and benefit from Social Security. Judge Carolyn Dineen King seemed skeptical of that argument at times, noting that deferred action wouldn't change the fact that someone entered the country illegally and would not protect them from deportation under any circumstance. \"Based on the unlawful thing that they did to begin with, you can turn them out tomorrow,\" she said. Arguments also settled on whether Texas and the states even have the power to challenge the federal executive branch's authority to regulate immigration. Arguments on that issue largely have centered on the costs Texas would incur by having to issue driver licenses to DAPA beneficiaries — an injury, the state argued — that gave them the right to sue. Two of the judges on Friday's panel, Jerry Smith and Jennifer Walker Elrod, were in the majority on a panel that voted 2-1 in May against allowing the deferred action programs to continue pending the appeal outcome. In that opinion, they disagreed with government contentions that Texas had no standing. They also ruled that the Obama action was subject to judicial review under the federal Administrative Procedures Act, which the Justice Department disputes. Obama's own statements came into play inside and outside the courtroom. Elrod noted at one point that Obama had once said he would \"have to change the law\" to implement reforms. Texas' attorney general's office, in a post-hearing news release, noted a statement Obama made last year that he had taken \"action to change the law.\" It was unclear Friday whether either Smith or Elrod was swayed by any of Friday's arguments.",

The iconic Harvard Square Forbes Plaza is known for its large outdoor seating area, where street performers and chess aficionados gather around built-in chessboards. But a recent Harvard University proposal to renovate parts of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center, formally known as the Holyoke Center, would eliminate approximately 20 percent of the existing beloved outdoor space at Forbes Plaza — much of the well-known al fresco dining area at Au Bon Pain, across the street from the MBTA Red Line T station on Massachusetts Avenue. The proposal, which received a certificate of appropriateness from the Cambridge Historical Commission, favorable recommendation from the Planning Board and support from the Harvard Square Advisory Committee, is before the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) for height and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) variances and a zoning relief for alteration and expansion of a nonconforming building.

Harvard has proposed to demolish approximately 13,600 square feet and add a net new floor area of about 7,500 square feet.

And the building’s height in an area of the 10th floor would increase from 112 feet to 116 feet. Tanya Iatridis, senior director of university planning for Harvard, said the project would enrich the visitor experience and include a two-level café, indoor and outdoor seating and gathering areas, an information desk, indoor and outdoor chess playing, Harvard events information and ticketing services, and public restrooms. The proposal is one in a series of initiatives in Harvard Square, including Harvard University’s transformation of the Science Plaza as an outdoor gathering space and the addition of seating in Harvard Yard. Prior to that, Cambridge took a renewed look at the square in the mid-1990s and in 1998 the Harvard Square Business Association instituted its first business improvement district, an area where resident businesses pay an extra fee to fund cleanup and beautification efforts. In 2006, the city launched the “Healthy Harvard Square Initiative” that examined the composition of commercial properties in the square. BZA members feel the proposed project includes improvements in public access and use on Dunster, Holyoke and Mt. Auburn streets. But they say Harvard has not clearly indicated the building’s operating hours and how the university plans to inform the community that the center would be open to the public. “The issue is Forbes Plaza and the public use of Forbes Plaza, also whether or not the quality of the enclosed public space is equivalent to the quality of the open public space,” BZA member Douglas Myers said. “The public has to be assured in a qualitative sense that the public enclosed space is somehow the equivalent of the open space. That’s what Harvard has to do before we can justify taking away 20 percent plus of the open space at Forbes Plaza, which is the heart, the essence of Sert’s contribution to the public.” Myers, who raised concerns about the demolition of space in Forbes Plaza, and member Brendan Sullivan, who felt hung up on Harvard’s reluctance to specify exact public-access hours, requested that the university provide a statement of principles about those hours, signage, regulations and enforcement. “So much is being done to accomplish your objectives in other areas that I fail to see why the plan cannot be modified specifically regarding the façade and the fronting and the elevation that are on the reduction of Forbes Plaza so as to preserve the public space in Forbes Plaza,” Myers said. According to Councilor Nadeem Mazen, community benefit and accessibility should be the project’s priority. Taking open public space away will fundamentally change the character of the square and reduce the community’s benefit, he said. Presently, the arcade is open to the public from 7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Iatridis said Harvard intends to keep similar hours of operation. Harvard representatives are due before the BZA on July 30 and are expected to present their plan for signage as well as the terms and restrictions of public use.

    "DiffbotBody": "Developer 343 Industries announced today at San Diego Comic-Con that the Halo Channel, a channel devoted to all things , is now available on iOS and Android devices. What’s interesting is that the channel is not yet available on the Windows phone, however, the channel will launch when Windows 10 rolls out on phones soon. The Halo Channel App is available to download now from the Google Play store, iTunes App Store in addition to the platforms it’s already available on, such as Windows 8 and Xbox One. The Halo Channel now includes the new ViDoc 343 Industries revealed at San Diego Comic-Con in its entirety, now available to watch on the new platforms. Developer 343 also revealed a teaser trailer for the new animated series, Halo: The Fall of Reach, which explores the origins of Master Chief and Blue Team. In the ViDoc, Halo: A Hero Reborn, 343 introduces “Blue Team,” which looks to be the team we see Master Chief with during the Halo: Forward Unto Dawn miniseries that debuted before Halo 4 was released. Speaking of the ViDoc mentioned above, Halo 5: Guardians looks to keep Master Chief at the center of the story, though the player will be controlling both Blue Team with the Chief, and Fireteam Osiris, as Locke looks to hunt down the Master Chief and find out what is threatening the galaxy. The developers are looking to make things more interesting by adding the more “human” elements to the game, and this starts with adding Spartan Locke and his team. “We’ve got this big, galaxy spanning story,” narrative lead Brian Reed explains in the video. “There’s all these attacks that are happening on colonies. There’s this massive destruction that’s happening. ‘Somebody stop it! Somebody save the day!’ But at the heart of it, there’s this story of these two families and these two things that they want. And if you don’t have those quiet human stories, it doesn’t matter how many planets you blow up. Nobody’s going to care.” Halo 5: Guardians is the second attempt at an original game for 343 Industries after the studio took the helm from original creator Bungie. is 343 Industries’ chance to prove that the critical success Halo 4 recieved wasn’t a fluke, that this team is “worthy” to take the mantle and expand the universe. Developer 343 is looking to make Halo 5: Guardians a 60 FPS shooter, much like Call of Duty and other modern FPS titles, but it needs to be more than just 60 FPS for Microsoft to stand tall among its competitors. Halo 5: Guardians will launch this fall on Xbox One. Make sure you check out the video doc, with download links to the Halo Channel here. [Images via Microsoft] is the latest entry in the last-gen game being remastered for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One party. Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

    "DiffbotBody": "'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. A man was found shot dead in a car on a little-used road in Clairton early Friday. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man as Derek McCellan, 44, of Clairton. Acting Clairton police Chief Robert Ferry said the victim was found in the driver's seat of a Kia rental car by a passerby who was on his way to work. The discovery was made around 6:20 a.m. near the intersection of Chambers Street and Broad Avenue. Ferry said the road is not a well-traveled one. “He was parked there,” Ferry said. “He was probably down there for a while. Maybe a couple hours.” Allegheny County police are conducting the investigation. Eric Slagle is a staff writer for Trib Total Media. He can be reached at 412-664-9161, ext. 1966. Subscribe today!

    "DiffbotBody": "Four years ago, Cait Flanders, a personal finance writer in Vancouver who turns 30 tomorrow, pulled out her credit cards and faced the truth she had been avoiding for years: She was $25,000 CAD ($19,800 USD) in debt, and most of it had been frittered away. Student loans accounted for $4,500 CAD ($3,600 USD), but as for the rest? “I don’t have a great answer for it. I just lived a lifestyle I couldn’t afford,” she says. She wasn’t even a big shopper, and her rent, at $1,100 CAD ($870 USD), is below average for her city. It was mostly just inattention to her finances: “If my friends were going to dinner, I never wanted to say no. So even if that meant going out to dinner every day of the week, I said yes.” She started a blog, Blonde on a Budget, which now gets about 30,000 readers monthly, and after two years of scrimping — one haircut, no travel, no dining out, putting as much as 55% of her monthly income toward her debt — she was debt-free. Crush Credit Card Debt: An eBook From Forbes If running from the collection agencies isn’t your exercise of choice, read this book for tips and tricks on how to crush credit card debt. But afterward, she relaxed her budget. Though she didn’t fall back into debt, she would only save 8% of her monthly income even when she intended to put away 20%. She did hit that goal a few times that first year out of debt, but “considering I had once been doing without up to 55% of my income, that’s somewhat underwhelming,” she says. Then she saw a blog post by Mr. Money Mustache, a blogger who retired at age 30, in which he said that every permanent decrease in spending has a double benefit: it increases the amount of money you have each month to put into savings, plus it also lowers the amount you need every month for the rest of your life. Around the same time, her sister had boasted to her of saving 20% of her income. “I said, ‘Whoa whoa whoa — you live at home and are going to school. Do you need 80% of your income?’ And I thought, ‘Why don’t I give myself the same advice?’” she says. One day, not able to find little things — a can opener, a razor blade — in her one-bedroom apartment, she realized her cupboards were overflowing with junk. “I’m spending $5 here, $10 there … It’s nothing crazy — an extra lotion or shower gel — but then you have eight of them. I was consuming just for the sake of consuming. I thought, ‘I need to stop buying and just use up this stuff I already have.’” A month later (and a year ago today), she embarked upon a year-long shopping ban. Over the year, she got rid of 70% of her stuff, lived on just 51% of her income ($28,000 CAD, $22,000 USD), saved 31% (about $17,000 CAD, $13,500 USD) and traveled on the last 18%, with two trips to New York, one trip to New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and other trips to Portland, New Orleans, Denver and her hometown Victoria and Toronto several times each (total cost of travel: just under $10,000 CAD; $8,000 USD). Here’s how she did it. What were the rules of the shopping ban? There were two things I knew I had to stop buying. One was takeout coffee. When I was getting out of debt, I’d let myself have a small budget for coffee, but as soon as I was out of debt, I let myself get takeout coffee every single day. The other was books. I owned 50 books I hadn’t read, and yet I was constantly buying more of them. I also banned other mindless things — like, I used to buy a new nail polish but then actually wear it twice the entire year. I couldn’t buy candles, notebooks, magazines or electronics. I was not allowed to buy clothes, except for a couple things I realized at the beginning I would need. I did a massive declutter and realized how much stuff I never wore. I’ve always been someone who wear the same five things. So I challenged myself to live with a small number of items. What parts of the ban were most difficult? The first month was really tough because of the no coffee and the no books. It was fascinating to realize what my triggers were and the habits I’d built around both those things. With coffee, my habits were that if I was really tired in the morning, I’d tell myself it was OK to get takeout coffee. Not being able to do that was eye-opening, realizing how many times in the past I’d justified that purchase when it takes two minutes to make coffee. Also, if I was going to run errands, for some reason, I would always buy a latte beforehand. Buying books was a big one, because I’d want to buy a new book, but if you spend $25, you get free shipping, so I’d add extra books. It got worse when I got an e-reader because you don’t even swipe a card. Five months in, on black Friday, I almost broke my no new electronics rule. My e-reader is pretty busted. I have to use a pin to hit the reset button to turn it on. I saw the e-reader on sale for $40 or $50 and they’re only $100 so it was a huge discount, which never happens, so I convinced myself that I needed it. Within five seconds of purchasing it, I was like, what did you just do. Sure my e-reader is annoying, but it works. So I immediately canceled the order. And then I realized I barely use my e-reader. I didn’t use it for a month after that because I’d been borrowing books from the library. Why did you get rid of your stuff? One, I realized how much I already had. But also, I would see things I wasn’t wearing or all the books I hadn’t read yet, and it would make me feel bad. So I opened up every closet and drawer and pulled everything out and asked myself, ‘When was the last time I used this?’ ‘Am I actually going to use this in the next couple of months?’ If not, it had to go. Books were also interesting because I got rid of a bunch of books that I hadn’t read yet. I used to buy books because I wanted to portray a certain perception of myself, like I would be the kind of person who had read that book. But none of those actually interested me, so I got rid of those too. So, in the summer, I got rid of 43% of my stuff. How do you know it was 43%? I kept inventory. I’m not kidding — I actually wrote down how many things I kept and how many things I got rid of. I didn’t count things like 10 knives, but I did count things like pens. Pens are another thing you stockpile. I had 30-something pens, and I was like, I might run out of three a year, so I have 10 years’ worth of pens right now. So I donated the pens to one of the charities that gives to schools. I didn’t throw out very much unless it was socks that had holes in them or products that were used. I donated all my clothes to a store where the proceeds go to two charities in Vancouver. I donated all my books to the library. I sold a few things I knew I could get $100 for, like a juicer or an old camera. But about the 43% — that’s just how much I got rid of last summer. Throughout the entire year, I got rid of 70% of my stuff. I read a bunch of books on it, but they would talk about decluttering in the sense of organizing, so it would be like, declutter your home by buying storage solutions. But that’s not the problem — the problem is you have too much stuff. If you actually don’t use something, it takes up more mental clutter even than physical clutter. Before you started the blog, you went out to dinner all the time, but to pay off your debt, you stopped. Did that change your friendships? No — I didn’t have a problem saying to people, ‘Let’s do something at your house instead,’ or ‘Let’s have a barbecue.’ Once you suggest it, it’s surprising how many people will agree with you because, honestly, most people can’t go out as much as they think they can. They’re also thinking, yes, it would cost $5 or $10 instead of $30 to go out. It just changed the way I hung out with people — we’d go for coffee, walks or hikes. Once you started the ban, how did it affect your relationships if you were also no longer going out to get coffee with people? I never put a ban on going out for meals this year. The coffee ban was that I wasn’t allowed to get coffee by myself anymore to break a bad habit. I would still go out for meals, but only once a week, so maybe a couple dinners and a couple brunches in an entire month. I will say a lot of my friends think I’m crazy. Everyone is astounded I haven’t bought stuff for the year. They kind of think I’m a freak. The coolest thing is how many of my friends said, your shopping ban inspired me to not to make this impulse purchase. How much were you earning? When I started the blog, I was making about $50,000 CAD ($39,700 USD) and throughout this shopping ban, including freelancing, I’ve earned $73,000 CAD ($57,900 USD), though after taxes I took home $55,000 CAD ($43,700 USD). But as of yesterday, I’m a full-time freelancer. Wow! Congratulations! My leap into freelance has been a weird byproduct of this entire experience for the last year. I was always chasing career success, and I thought what I made annually would attach to that. Along with the shopping ban, I decided I wanted to live off 50% of my income, so I had this goal in mind and now I very comfortably live on $2,000 ($1,600 USD) a month — a very full and rich life. I realized it’s wonderful to earn money but my career success would be more dependent on whether or not I enjoyed what I was doing. Freelance is like the opposite of early retirement. I still have to work, I’m not living off savings, but when people retire early, it’s so they can work on the things they want to work on. Freelance is the same way. It’s a different kind of success, and one I’d rather go after. You decided to make the ban stricter halfway through the year. Why? When I started this job, I remember vividly saying, I was never going to become the kind of person who made their own cleaning products, I was just trying to spend less. But as time has gone on, the idea of making my own stuff interested me quite a bit, as does gardening and having vegetables and fruit I had grown myself. So I planted a garden and cut cleaning products in favor of creating my own from vinegar, lemon and baking soda. But since announcing that, I have been traveling a lot so I never ran out of the supplies I already had and never got to make my own cleaning stuff. And for that reason — I haven’t even announced this on my blog yet — I’m actually going to do the ban for two years. Really? Just so you can make your own cleaning supplies? Also because in the last few months, it almost became too easy. I don’t need anything. I never think about clothes or shoes or needing anything, so in some ways this will just be my lifestyle. But I just want to challenge myself again. So in the beginning, I’ll, again, create a short list of things I am allowed to buy throughout the year — like, since I wear the same clothes all the time, I do need more shirts. And more out of curiosity’s sake, I want to keep track of every single thing I buy — like every single toothpaste. I think it would be really eye-opening. You don’t need to buy a box of ten toothpastes. That’s probably a two-year supply. What intangible benefits did you get from the ban, whether psychological or spiritual or something else? I feel like the best version of myself right now. In getting rid of stuff and not being able to buy more, I’ve come to grips with who I am as a person. I’m very comfortable with myself. I don’t need to buy or own anything that will make me look or will make people think of me a certain way. I live a very good life with what I have. I don’t need more and don’t need the newest or latest of anything and don’t think it will make me feel better. Getting rid of stuff also gives you time back — I don’t spend my weekends cleaning because I can easily organize everything I own. It frees up time to focus on the things you do want to do. I’ve tackled more projects and gotten more writing done and been able to increase my freelancing and quit, because I don’t care about anything else. It’s shown me what’s mattered most to me. What I care about is having good relationships with my family and friends and accomplishing other goals like the writing and being able to quit my job and being able to travel more. Buying things is not important to me. Now it’s gotten to a weird place where I feel not only uncomfortable spending money but I had to go into a mall to buy a baby present in a mall recently, and I felt almost sick in there because I was surrounded by ads. I felt overstimulated from being inside the mall. I don’t like the energy in there. Any other plans for the second year of the ban? I want to focus a lot more on simple and sustainable living, and on being more resourceful in general. I think one thing I’ve noticed is how much we pay for convenience, whether it’s takeout food or buying products vs. just fixing them. Recently, a pair of my workout capris ripped. Previously, I would have thrown them out. Instead I learned how to sew, fixed them, and they are perfectly fine and will probably last another year. I’d like to travel a little less this second year and save more — partially because it’s my first year of freelance. I want to keep that buffer and not blow money. I’ve been thinking about things that might happen way in the future. Vancouver is Canada’s most expensive city — the average price to buy a home now is $1.5 million CAD ($1.2 million USD). I wouldn’t be able to buy the condo I rent for less than $350,000 CAD ($278,000 USD). The thought of spending that amount of money for a little box inside of a big building makes me a little bit sick. I’ve thought about buying some land and putting up a little house on it. Not 100 square feet, but a few hundred square feet. I don’t need a four-bedroom home. But, for the next year, I’ll focus on being more resourceful. Do you have any advice for others? That year after I paid my debt, I was letting my money do things that weren’t actually aligning with my goals. If you’re not getting anywhere with your goals, are there expenses you could cut out that don’t align with your long- or short-term goals? You don’t have to stop drinking coffee because it will save you $500 a year, but is it more important to you to save that $500 for a trip? I think, whenever you make a transaction, your gut instinct tells you everything. You could very easily figure out where you could cut back and create a budget that aligns with your goals. Saying ‘I want to save 20%’ doesn’t mean anything. Why do you want to save money? Make sure your entire budget is wrapped around your goals, not just what you think you should be doing.

    "DiffbotBody": "Yesterday, we reported on a potentially massive Game of Thrones spoiler that now seems to have been confirmed. Sources are claiming that Jon Snow actor Kit Harington is definitely in Belfast filming episodes for the sixth season of Game of Thrones. Earlier this week, we learned that Miley Cyrus will host the 2015 VMAs, and the Internet immediately began buzzing with predictions about what we should expect. After all, Miley's VMA performance with Robin Thicke remains one of the most memorable moments in the show's history, and for better or worse, her hosting gig is sure to have plenty of people talking the next day. Great. This is so NOT what Kourtney Kardashian needs at the moment. According to the latest issue of Life \u0026 Style, just weeks after finally dumping Scott Disick, the reality star has discovered that she's pregnant. An official photo of the heir to the British monarchy, Prince George, has been released in honor of the youngster's second birthday today. The adorably cool picture, taken by fashion photographer Mario Testino, shows the toddler smiling in the arms of his dad, Prince William: Good to see that Teresa Giudice is still major causing drama in the Garden State from the unfriendly, federal prison confines of Danbury, Conn. After they learned Teresa signed a contract to return to Bravo, the rest of the Real Housewives of New Jersey cast members were up in arms. Last night on an enthralling Total Divas Season 4 Episode 3, peace talks between Nikki and Eva did not end the way you might have expected. Or hoped for. We sort of expected them to go to crap. Mention the initials JFK to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of American history, and the images that spring to mind will likely have little to do with his political achievements. Instead, the modern imagination springs right to John Fitzgerald Kennedy's grisly assassination in 1963 and the many infidelities that he reportedly engaged in throughout his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Ah, Donald Trump. Just when you think he's sunk as low as he can possible go, he manages to find a new rock bottom. First, Trump makes wildly racist comments right at the beginning of his presidential campaign. Khloe Kardashian is making big changes to her personal life and her professional life. As previously reported, the reality star has at least finalized her divorce from Lamar Odom, while she also may or may not be having a baby on her own. If you're all caught up on the battle for the Iron Throne (and if you're not, we suggest you go watch Game of Thrones online ASAP, because the spoilers will be flying fast and furious for the next ten months), then you probably already know who we're talking about from that headline. Scott Disick has seen better days, according to a new report. The unpopular reality star, who often acted like a drunken buffoon even when in a supposedly good place, is \"spiraling out of control\" in the wake of his split from Kourtney Kardashian. Blake Shelton isn't the only member of The Voice panel to have undergone a life change this week. But while Shelton filed for divorce from Miranda Lambert after four years of marriage, Adam Levine is still happily waking up in bed next to Behati Prinsloo each morning. The Bachelorette Season 11 Episode 11 saw the Men Tell All last night. Yet in doing so, they really didn't tell us much that we didn't know. So it goes for the show's annual penultimate installment, which is basically filler designed to drag out the season and hype up the finale. Earlier today, the world learned that beloved country superstars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert are getting divorced. While no reason for the split has been revealed as of yet, the couple issued a joint statement moments ago confirming that they're ending their four-year marriage and asking fans to respect their privacy. By now, you've probably heard that Kourtney Kardashian came to her senses and dumped Scott Disick like the douchey bad habit that he is. Sources say there was no one nail in the coffin, as a number of different factors led Kourtney to pull the plug on her 9-year relationship: According to one of the stars at the center of the Taylor Swift-Calvin Harris romance, these two stars are insanely happy together. And Swift says she has one person to thank for her ongoing relationship with the popular DJ: The two best-known transgender stars on the planet came together for the first time this weekend. Laverne Cox shared a photo on her Instagram account of her and Caitlyn Jenner hanging out at an advanced screening yesterday of the latter’s upcoming E! reality series, I Am Cait. ABC's new Bachelor in Paradise Season 2 promo offers our first glimpse at the crazy times coming our way on Sunday, August 2. And we mean crazy. By our count, there are at least a half dozen makeout sessions and breakdown sessions in this teaser alone! Demi Moore has issued a statement in response to a stunning tragedy that took place at her home over the weekend. As reported by multiple outlets, the body of a 21-year old man was found dead in the actress' swimming pool early Sunday morning following a party at the residence on Saturday night.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Nobody seems all that upset about end-of-life counseling anymore. For all the talk of \"death panels\" six years ago, the news that Medicare intended to start paying doctors for counseling their patients on end-of-life care mustered little more than a whimper. In 2009, end-of-life counseling's presence in early drafts of the health care reform law led to fear-mongering (and a PolitiFact Lie of the Year award) about \"death panels.\" Now, it appears that rhetoric has gone quietly into the night. Some Republicans actually praised the Obama administration's decision announced Wednesday, saying that it should help Americans navigate a difficult time in their lives. And even opponents of the policy acknowledged that there might not be much that they could do to stop it. \"I like that. I do,\" said Tennessee Rep. Phil Roe, a stalwart conservative and cochair of the GOP Doctors Caucus, in an interview. Roe is a long-time supporter of end-of-life counseling and has cosponsored legislation in the past with Oregon Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer to have Medicare pay for it. He wasn't alone. \"This particular issue was one of the few things within the health care law that I thought was a good provision,\" said Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, another Republican doctor who is running for his state's open Senate seat next year. \"If you have somebody who's going to hospice or has a terminal illness, and a physician going to counsel them on their end-of-life issues ... the individual should be compensated or reimbursed, just like any other consultative service.\" \"It's something that is both professional and personal to me. I've had to do that myself and my own family,\" said Roe, whose wife died of cancer four months ago. \"It's something that nobody likes to talk about. This is not the fun part of medicine. \"But it's something everybody's going to do,\" he continued. \"It's something you should sit down and discuss with your doctor and your family, and this is just a way to reimburse the doctor a little bit for their time because otherwise we just took the time to do it.\" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule, which will be open to public comment for 60 days, to have Medicare reimburse doctors for conducting end-of-life counseling with their patients. (The New York Times reported that 80 percent of Americans who die every year are covered by the government insurance program). Doctors would be paid for 30-minute face-to-face sessions starting in January under the proposal. The exact payment amounts will be set after the public-comment period. \"Establishing separate payment for advance care planning codes provides beneficiaries and practitioners greater opportunity and flexibility to utilize these planning sessions at the most appropriate time for patients and their families,\" the agency said. Not everybody in Congress shares the administration's or Roe's outlook, however. Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who cochairs the GOP Doctors Caucus with Roe, said the proposed Medicare rule was another example of \"wasteful Washington spending\" that could be prone to fraud. He gave the example of a patient coming in for a blood-pressure check but having it billed as an end-of-life counseling session. \"Since when does the government have to micromanage people to do what is best for them in their lives?\" said Fleming, who did say he supports doctors and patients talking about end-of-life care and doesn't mind public-awareness campaigns encouraging them to do so. Great news in short form along with much needed humor.\" Patrick, President of private healthcare consulting firm Informative and help[s] me stay on track. \" Director of Scientific Affairs, Non-profit medicial society However, he said, \"to prescribe into the law that we should pay specially just for that discussion I think is just again another example of wasteful Washington spending.\" But whether opponents are going to make much effort to publicly decry or stop the CMS rule is unclear. The National Right to Life Committee, which opposes the policy and said \"its pervasive focus is to 'nudge' patients to agree to forego life-saving treatment and even assisted feeding through the use of unbalanced, distorted, and even inaccurate information,\" said it was working with lawmakers on alternative proposals but declined to name names. Fleming seemed skeptical that they had many options to stop the administration's plan. \"If it's something that the president can do without a vote, there's not much we can say or do,\" he said. \"I wouldn't foresee there being a lot of controversy over it,\" Heck said, noting that, for many Obamacare opponents, a Medicare advisory board that was created by the law has since taken on the moniker of \"death panel\" or \"rationing board.\" The House voted to repeal the board last month. Roe does expect some charged rhetoric after the rule's release, but he also said when he has talked with other Republicans about why he supports the policy, they start to look at it differently. \"The reason I stepped up is I know what happened in 2009, and it's easy to demagogue,\" Roe said. \"When you get an issue that's easy to demagogue, you need to somebody that's actually been boots on the ground, that's actually dealt with this at 3 o'clock in the morning.\" \"You have to lower the temperature in the room,\" he said. \"Once you sat down and explain to them what it was, so that it wasn't demagogued, people were receptive to that because they understand that one of these days, everybody's going to have to make that decision.\"",

I’ve had to do that my­self and my own fam­ily,” said Roe, whose wife died of can­cer four months ago. “It’s something that nobody likes to talk about. This is not the fun part of medi­cine. “But it’s something every­body’s go­ing to do,” he con­tin­ued. “It’s something you should sit down and dis­cuss with your doc­tor and your fam­ily, and this is just a way to re­im­burse the doc­tor a little bit for their time be­cause oth­er­wise we just took the time to do it.” The Cen­ters for Medi­care and Medi­caid Ser­vices pro­posed a rule, which will be open to pub­lic com­ment for 60 days, to have Medi­care re­im­burse doc­tors for con­duct­ing end-of-life coun­sel­ing with their pa­tients. (The New York Times re­por­ted that 80 per­cent of Amer­ic­ans who die every year are covered by the gov­ern­ment in­sur­ance pro­gram). Doc­tors would be paid for 30-minute face-to-face ses­sions start­ing in Janu­ary un­der the pro­pos­al. The ex­act pay­ment amounts will be set after the pub­lic-com­ment peri­od. “Es­tab­lish­ing sep­ar­ate pay­ment for ad­vance care plan­ning codes provides be­ne­fi­ciar­ies and prac­ti­tion­ers great­er op­por­tun­ity and flex­ib­il­ity to util­ize these plan­ning ses­sions at the most ap­pro­pri­ate time for pa­tients and their fam­il­ies,” the agency said. Not every­body in Con­gress shares the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s or Roe’s out­look, however. Louisi­ana Rep. John Flem­ing, who co­chairs the GOP Doc­tors Caucus with Roe, said the pro­posed Medi­care rule was an­oth­er ex­ample of “waste­ful Wash­ing­ton spend­ing” that could be prone to fraud. He gave the ex­ample of a pa­tient com­ing in for a blood-pres­sure check but hav­ing it billed as an end-of-life coun­sel­ing ses­sion. “Since when does the gov­ern­ment have to mi­cro­man­age people to do what is best for them in their lives?” said Flem­ing, who did say he sup­ports doc­tors and pa­tients talk­ing about end-of-life care and doesn’t mind pub­lic-aware­ness cam­paigns en­cour­aging them to do so. However, he said, “to pre­scribe in­to the law that we should pay spe­cially just for that dis­cus­sion I think is just again an­oth­er ex­ample of waste­ful Wash­ing­ton spend­ing.” But wheth­er op­pon­ents are go­ing to make much ef­fort to pub­licly de­cry or stop the CMS rule is un­clear. The Na­tion­al Right to Life Com­mit­tee, which op­poses the policy and said “its per­vas­ive fo­cus is to ‘nudge’ pa­tients to agree to fore­go life-sav­ing treat­ment and even as­sisted feed­ing through the use of un­bal­anced, dis­tor­ted, and even in­ac­cur­ate in­form­a­tion,” said it was work­ing with law­makers on al­tern­at­ive pro­pos­als but de­clined to name names. Flem­ing seemed skep­tic­al that they had many op­tions to stop the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s plan. “If it’s something that the pres­id­ent can do without a vote, there’s not much we can say or do,” he said. “I wouldn’t fore­see there be­ing a lot of con­tro­versy over it,” Heck said, not­ing that, for many Obama­care op­pon­ents, a Medi­care ad­vis­ory board that was cre­ated by the law has since taken on the monik­er of “death pan­el” or “ra­tion­ing board.” The House voted to re­peal the board last month. Roe does ex­pect some charged rhet­or­ic after the rule’s re­lease, but he also said when he has talked with oth­er Re­pub­lic­ans about why he sup­ports the policy, they start to look at it dif­fer­ently. “The reas­on I stepped up is I know what happened in 2009, and it’s easy to dem­agogue,” Roe said. “When you get an is­sue that’s easy to dem­agogue, you need to some­body that’s ac­tu­ally been boots on the ground, that’s ac­tu­ally dealt with this at 3 o’clock in the morn­ing.” “You have to lower the tem­per­at­ure in the room,” he said. “Once you sat down and ex­plain to them what it was, so that it wasn’t dem­agogued, people were re­cept­ive to that be­cause they un­der­stand that one of these days, every­body’s go­ing to have to make that de­cision.”",

After nearly 18 months working on the sensitive subject, project leader Dr Robert Gorkin said GELdom had now teamed with Victoria's Swinburne University of Technology to further develop marketing and design, while they were preparing for \"phase two\", where they could actually bedroom-test their products.

Specifically, to WWII-era England… The owners of Grange Farm, siblings Jack and Audrey Newton, recently passed away, leaving no relatives behind. Neither ever married, and they lived in the farmhouse together for seventy years, ever since their family moved there in the 1940s. And, as it was recently discovered, the siblings left the entire house in its original 1940s glory… Everything from the entryway… To the living room… And even the kitchen are as though time stopped in the 1940s: They didn’t even have a refrigerator! And it’s not just the furniture that was so lovingly preserved. The Newton siblings apparently still used everyday household items from the 40s, as well! The beautiful vintage china place settings remained in tact… As did a staggering variety of musical instruments, toys, and knickknacks… And it wasn’t just public spaces that seemed stuck in time… Each and every one of the nine bedrooms in the home are fantastically old-fashioned: From the coverlets and the bed frames, to the carpets and furniture, every single piece harkens to post-WWII England… Vintage makeup and magazines were obviously very well-loved and cared for… As was a selection of gorgeous silk scarves fit for any fashionable, yet sensible, gal in the 1940s. The most private spheres are no exception either… There’s even a chamber pot! The house’s contents were auctioned off recently by Howkins and Harrison, and the empty farmhouse will placed on the market later this year, with an estimated price of £600,000 (roughly $920,000). The property includes 115 acres of land, which the Newton siblings farmed their entire lives. The auction may signal the end of an era, but hopefully this lovingly preserved farmhouse will be home to many new beginnings to come.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A Different Type of Osteoarthritis Treatment Did you know that osteoarthritis knee pain is caused by more than just cartilage loss? In knees with osteoarthritis, the joint fluid also loses its ability to absorb shock, which can result in osteoarthritis knee pain. A viscosupplement injection is a treatment that supplements your natural joint fluid to give your knee the lubrication and cushioning it needs to provide osteoarthritis knee pain relief. What is Synvisc-One? Synvisc-One is a one-injection treatment that supplements the fluid in your knee to help lubricate and cushion the joint. Synvisc-One is the #1 prescribed viscosupplement; it provides up to six months of osteoarthritis knee pain relief with just one injection.* How Synvisc-One Works Knee with Osteoarthritis Before Synvisc-One InjectionIn knees with osteoarthritis, the cartilage gradually deteriorates, joint fluid loses its shock-absorbing qualities, and bones may begin to rub against each other—all of which may cause bone spurs and the knee pain you're feeling. Knee with Osteoarthritis After Synvisc-One InjectionSynvisc-One lubricates and cushions your knee. It is a single-dose injection that supplements your knee joint fluid to relieve the pain for up to six months.* How do I know if Synvisc-One is right for me? Synvisc-One is for people with knee osteoarthritis who have not received enough pain relief from diet, exercise, and over-the-counter pain medication. If you've tried these options and are still feeling knee pain, ask your doctor if Synvisc-One could help. What is Synvisc-One made from? The injection contains a gel-like mixture made from a substance called hyaluronan (pronounced hy-aI-u-ROE-nan) that comes from chicken combs. Hyaluronan is a natural substance found in the body and is present in very high amounts in joints. The body's own hyaluronan acts like a lubricant and a shock absorber in the joint and is needed for the joint to work properly. Will the injection hurt? The doctor will likely apply a numbing agent before a Synvisc-One injection. You may feel some pressure. What are the side effects? The most common side effects are pain, swelling, heat, redness and/or fluid build-up around the knee. In a medical study less than 6% of patients experienced these side effects, which were generally mild and did not last long. Is it covered by insurance? Synvisc-One is covered by Medicare and most insurance plans. Get up to six months of osteoarthritis knee pain relief with Synvisc-One.* You don't need to be in constant pain to be ready for a different treatment. Receive a FREE Osteoarthritis Knee Pain Relief Info Kit to learn more about Synvisc-One today. Indication Synvisc-One® (hylan G-F 20) is indicated for the treatment of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics, e.g., acetaminophen. Important Safety Information Before trying Synvisc-One, tell your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction, such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat, respiratory difficulty, rash, itching or hives to SYNVISC or any hyaluronan-based products. Allergic reactions, some which can be potentially severe, have been reported during the use of Synvisc-One. Should not be used in patients with an infected knee joint, skin disease or infection around the area where the injection will be given, and should be used with caution when there is swelling of the legs due to problems with venous stasis or lymphatic drainage. Synvisc-One is only for injection into the knee, performed by a doctor or other qualified health care professional. Synvisc-One has not been tested to show pain relief in joints other than the knee. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to products from birds – such as feathers, eggs or poultry – or if your leg is swollen or infected. Synvisc-One has not been tested in children (≤21years old), pregnant women or women who are nursing. You should tell your doctor if you think you are pregnant or if you are nursing a child. Talk to your doctor before resuming strenuous weight-bearing activities after treatment. The side effects sometimes seen after Synvisc-One include (\u003c2% each): pain, swelling, heat, redness, and/or fluid build-up in or around the knee.

Beachgoers use water and wet towels to keep a bottlenose dolphin cool after it washed ashore Friday on Kure Beach. The dolphin later died, according to a UNCW professor.

Biologists at UNCW will conduct a necropsy on the dolphin Saturday to determine how it died, as well as take samples for marine biology research, she said.

    "DiffbotBody": "The summer holiday is a fun time to enjoy family and friends, but sometimes in the excitement of the holiday, accidents can happen. Heeding some basic safety tips this summer could help to keep you and your loved ones in vacation action and out of the emergency department. Here are some tips to help make sure that your summer holiday is a safe and happy one: OUTDOOR WORK and PLAY: Planning some yard work and gardening? Wear appropriate protective gear. Before you mow the grass, clear the lawn of sticks and stones that can become flying objects and wear goggles, sturdy shoes and long pants while working outdoors. Gloves are important gear to lower your risk for skin irritations, cuts and insect bites. And don’t forget about the sunscreen! Even if you’re only out for a short time, you need to wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher. For added protection, wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. HEAT-RELATED ILLNESS: Monitor your activities and limit your time in the sun to lower your risk for heat-related illness. Regardless of your activity level, drink plenty of water to prevent heat illness. Try to avoid alcohol and sugary drinks that can cause you to become dehydrated, especially in the heat. Know and pay attention to signs of heat-related illness, including extremely high body temperature, headache, rapid pulse, dizziness, nausea, confusion or unconsciousness, and keep a watch on those who are at a higher risk for heat-related illness like infants, children and adults older than 65. FIRST-AID KIT: Keep a first-aid kit handy at home and even in your car. Make sure it is stocked with bandages, gauze tape, hydrogen peroxide or iodine, burn cream or spray, calamine lotion and tweezers. These items will be helpful in the event of minor scrapes, burns, rashes or splinters. WATER SAFETY: First and foremost, learn to swim. Formal swim lessons can help protect you and your child from drowning; however, children require constant supervision at all times in or near the water. Use the buddy system and never swim alone. Never dive into unknown waters or swim in areas deemed off limits. Avoid drinking alcohol before or during swimming, boating or water skiing. Do not drink alcohol while supervising children. If you’re in or around natural water settings: Use U.S. Coast Guard- approved life jackets. Check weather conditions before swimming or boating. BARBECUE BASICS Wash your hands with soap and water for 15 to 20 seconds after visiting the restroom and before cooking and eating. Keep raw food separate from cooked food. Before you re-use a plate that has been exposed to raw meat, wash it in hot, soapy water or use another plate altogether. Keep utensils and surfaces clean too. Cook food thoroughly to kill any bacteria and use a thermometer. There’s nothing better than a juicy hamburger, but make sure they are brown all the way through and not pink. Generally, hamburgers should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees and chicken to at least 165 degrees. Remember to refrigerate. Never leave food sitting out for more than two hours or more than an hour in 90-degree temperatures. Keep it hot or cold. Hot food should be kept at or below 40 degrees and should be eaten within two hours of cooking or purchase. Foods like chicken salad or cold desserts should be held at 40 degrees.",

    "DiffbotBody": "They say it is all in who you know, and this also applies to getting in front of investors. Typically investors, whether they are in a VC firm, part of an accelerator or incubator, or an angel investor, do not consider start-ups on a cold call basis. Investors tend to listen to other investors about potential companies to add to their portfolio in a similar way that a consumer will listen to their peer group about a new product, store, or restaurant. With peer power driving the investment potential of your start-up, you need to figure out how to get introduced to those investors who fund and fuel your space or business segment. Here are the steps you should take to ramp up the number of investors’ doors your foot is firmly planted in: Start within your own network to determine who you know and then research, both online and offline, who are within their networks. Online, you can most often see their connections on places like LinkedIn and other professional social networking sites. By doing this, you are actually creating a new network made up specifically of just introducers. Attend meet-ups, conferences, and pitch competitions where you know your network and these potential investors will be so you can get a chance at a more personal, one-on-one introduction. This way, you can also observe their body language and leverage your own interpersonal skills, knowledge, and prepared elevator pitch to make the most of the introduction. Although a typical VC does not go to conferences with the idea of meeting new investments, an introduction by another investor while attending the conference or meet-up can still have a positive impact. Specifically ask a friend or colleague to introduce you to a certain investor you have your eye on after your research. You might even compose an email your friend can send on your behalf so they create the connection for you. It needs to be concise and contain everything you want to tell them within the body of the email. Your friend is most likely already sold on your start-up, so focus on making an effective e-mail message. With friends, also do not take advantage by asking for a list of introductions. Instead, focus on two or three really important introductions they can help you make. Ask a fellow entrepreneur. Even if you do not consider an entrepreneur a personal friend but you run in similar circles, it does not hurt to reach out and ask them for an investor introduction. Often, those entrepreneurs were once like you and were seeking their own introductions. In the same spirit, many are then willing to help others in that same boat. While this helps you, the entrepreneur also gets a nod of appreciation from the investor who is most likely looking for new opportunities and likes being connected to a likely viable business idea. Just be sure to really sell your idea to the entrepreneur so he feels excited and passionate about creating that introduction to an investor on your behalf. When your start-up takes off, make sure to pay it forward and help out others that could value from your new connector status. Ask those early investors for an investor introduction, if you already have some funding. Like creating those social media brand advocates that preach the word about companies and products, these early investors can also fervently share their enthusiasm with other investors and create an introduction that can help with something they see is missing – whether that is additional funding or segment experience or connections. “An investor will listen to an investor, and likely already knows what it is like to work with them. The trust and working relationship is established so that introduction may just be what solidifies a great opportunity.” Manny Fernandez Founder of DreamFunded. Keep a database of who you would like to be introduced to, as well as who can introduce you, and whether or not you have been introduced with notes about the results. Once you start getting a pipeline of potential introductions, you want to stay on top of them so you do not begin to confuse investors and ruin your chance at a connection because you did not pay attention to the details. Let the person who did the introducing know how it went, as they likely want to know if it paid off for you or if there is anything else they can do. This will help nurture what can be a long-term relationship that offers value to the both of you. It is still good business practice to be polite. Any connectors that you are turning to would also appreciate any updates in how your start-up is proceeding in terms of news and successes, which may help trigger other ideas for investor introductions. They may have also been hesitating to introduce you to someone, but hearing that you are progressing may change their mind. While this is a list of Do’s when it comes to how to get introduced to investors, there is one major Don’t, which is do not ask others to identify investors on your behalf or do all the work. You must do your own research and come prepared with information that fits those investors. With that in hand, using these avenues to get introduced is a major step toward getting funding. Andrea Zurek Founding Partner, XG Ventures said “Be able to talk about your company and it’s product in one or two sentences. Be conscientious of the investor’s time. Most investors will ask for a presentation deck, but you should be able to distill your company’s value proposition in an attention getting phrase(s) – short, to the point. Answer the so what? What does it mean for me the consumer? What does it mean for me as an investor? Will the product solve something that no one else is doing or better? Don’t be the next “uber” or “dropbox” of “x” or “y.” Your product/company should stand on its own merits. What’s your plan to ramp the company, get customers, do you have an exit strategy? In other words, have a well thought out plan and walk the investor through that logic train.” After the door of opportunity is opened, it is up to you to have your pitch prepared.",

Middle School Grand Prize Wining Entry Tell the World ~ by Dorian Sage ©Lakota Children’s Enrichment, Inc. 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge Dorian is a middle school student from the Pine Ridge Reservation. In his Grand Prize winning essay he says: In the Lakota way, everything is connected… We relied on the Earth, but it did not rely on us… In our tradition, you respect everything. This idea was lost with the European colonization of the Americas, and I’m trying to bring it back. Writing Judge Susanne Pari said about Dorian’s winning entry: “Dorian Sage’s essay speaks with great wisdom to the responsibility all of humanity must take for the well-being of our world. He does this not only through his presentation of Lakota history and tradition, but also through examples of natural science. His writing is stellar.” We agree and think you will, too! Tell The World In the Lakota way, everything is connected. In days past you could see it in the rustling of the leaves or the swift rushing of a waterfall. Now you can see it in more obvious ways. The worms tunnel below the Earth, searching for food while at the same time helping the plants collect oxygen through their roots. This insight is fading from the general population, and because of this we are no longer taking care of the Earth. In the past, the Lakota people would migrate so that the Earth had a time for cleansing. The area that we lived in would never be forgotten so much that it would die. We relied on the Earth, but it did not rely on us. Aspens are a unique kind of tree because they sprout from the roots of another Aspen, which is why you often see them growing in groves. If one of these trees gets sick, the rest of the trees usually get sick too because they rely on the same food supply. It is much the same with us. If one of our food sources had an unexpected shortage in production, the majority of human life would be affected. This is just one of the reasons it’s good to be self-reliant, and to have your own energy source if possible. Everything is too connected in the modern world. There is no longer privacy, and your information is there for everybody to see. If something happened in the world, like an outbreak of some sort, our food supply could be cut off, and it could affect our water because we don’t focus on renewable sources of food and energy. Human life is too destructive, and it is ruining the Earth’s natural cycle. Eventually humans are going to bring about their own downfall, and there will be nothing there to stop it. This is why I encourage our great people to start living off the grid, and to start relying on themselves for sustenance. In our traditional ways, we would always let the Earth replenish itself. We relied directly on the animals and on the signs from nature for survival. One tribe in Africa even relies directly on a certain species of bird to help them find beehives. The bird helps the tribe so that in return they will give them part of the honey store that the bee hive holds. The bird will fly in the direction of the hive, showing the humans where to get it, and then will whistle when nearby. The bird will then wait on a tree somewhere near until the people leave a piece of the honeycomb somewhere within the bird’s line of sight. If the idea of these short paragraphs is not yet obvious, what I am trying to get at is everything is connected, even us. We need to start relying more on ourselves for our food, and taking better care of the environment which takes such good care of us. In our tradition, you respect everything. This idea was lost with the European colonization of the Americas and I’m trying to bring it back.

Writing Judge Susanne Pari said of the poem: “Jeila Schuh has written from a deeply personal place, where all good writing comes from. This takes tremendous courage and is perhaps the most essential ingredient for bringing listeners to a story.” Pretend (Bullying) You look innocent You play pretend How can anyone believe that? Words hurt, you say. When all I want is to fade away, I wake up with regret And all I want is to forget. What’s a true bully? You have power But I refuse to give, Through the doors I will be safe, Please, Let me be, You pretended You acted innocent, Is that what you wanted? Is it too late? I have an identity You have a name, All I want is to fade away Forgetting is regretting, I refuse to give, I can end all this I don’t have to take this, You will hear my voice I’ll start speaking out, You’re a bully I don’t have to take your Pain Jeila Schuh Runner-Up — Middle School 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge; ©2015 Lakota Children’s Enrichment, All Rights Reserved; ©2015 CinMagPhotography For Alanie Marie Martin ©Lakota Children’s Enrichment, Inc. 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge Poet Paisley Sierra’s poem is a tribute to a classmate and friend, whose life ended too early. Her poem illustrates the confusion, guilt and pain that can surround a suicide. For Alanie Marie Martin No one wanted you to leave. We all loved you. You left us without a reason. But you’re now with Tunkasila. He will take care of you. Now that you’re gone. Don’t worry about us. We’ll be fine. We miss you a lot. When you laughed. We laughed. When you smiled. We smiled. And when you cried We tried to make it better. But you committing suicide made us realize; We should have been there for you. You were the funniest, sweetest, and nicest person in the world! No one thought that you would do that.

Cetan awed the judges with his thoughtful and optimistic reflection on Lakota culture and his call to action for people to work together and take care of one another. Cetan said: “I imagine a world where we all hold hands, to make the world circular again. All lives matter — we, as living beings, need to realize that.” #inspirational Hope for the Future I have lived here for 15 years…. a place of serenity and wide open space, to let your thoughts flow through the wavy grass, the trees speak to you by rustling together a quote on quote “happy place.” The only way you are reading this right now is in ENGLISH, a very invasive language that has taken over many people, Lakota Language blew away in the wind, by a people who seem to think they can get whatever they want, in this life and the next is all fun and games to them (wasicu), My culture and many others are dying off every single day, because of these reasons…. Alcohol, a poison that course through your veins, to so called make you “happy,” taking your wheel and endangering lives, 3 cans equal one life….., Television, a screen that ruins our vision, taking us into their electrical flow transforming our lives, technology has mad us more distant than ever, and will never get better unless we shut off and come back to reality….. Youth being bullied at home because they did not do their chore “right,” then, they transform into a mind numbing bully, making lives miserable by the minute….. Lastly there is war, a mind chosen process that instructs you to kill, taking the bullet of life and striking the tip into another’s heart, it is saddening and horrifying just to even think about, we are fighting people that are just like us, over beliefs and differences….. All these reasons are flat out solvable, but our world is rough and rigid because of these reasons, I imagine a world where we all hold hands, to make the world circular again, All lives matter — we, as living beings, need to realize that. Cetan Ducheneaux Runner-Up — Middle School 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge; © Lakota Children’s Enrichment, All Rights Reserved; © 2015 CinMagPhotography How Can I Help You? ©Lakota Children’s Enrichment, Inc. 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge Jetta Tobacco is a Co-Founding member of LCE’s Youth Board. 2015 was the first year that she was old enough to enter the Writing Challenge and she won a Runner-Up award through an anonymous judging process! Through a partnership with Lakota Children’s Enrichment, Jetta and art challenge runner-up Savanah Jo Whiting recieved scholarships to attend a STEM camp in the summer of 2015 at the Rose-Hulman School of Technology. They were selected for the program through a competitive application process. Jetta’s essay speaks from the heart about the confusion and frustration of a young girl who wants to help her peers who are struggling through hard times. How Can I Help You? I chose to write about suicide because there’s a lot of it on the Rez and just last week someone decided to take their life — they said it was because they were being bullied. There’s a lot of cutting on the Rez, too. I ask my friends why they do it, and some of them just say ‘’I don’t know.’’ This makes me sad and confused: Why are you trying to take your life? Why are you hurting yourself? How can I help you if you don’t even know why you want to hurt yourself? I wish I could convince you it’s not “cool” to hurt yourself, and if you think it’s cool, it’s not. It’s not a solution. Ending your life will create a lot of pain for everyone. I am here to help, but I feel helpless… Suicide needs to stop. I want to help. So, that’s the reason I chose to write about suicide. Jetta Tobacco, Runner-Up — Middle School 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge; ©2015, Lakota Children’s Enrichment, All Rights Reserved; @2014 CinMagPhotography The War Within ©Lakota Children’s Enrichment, Inc. 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge This short story by Middle School student Deanna Rae Chipps is about a young girl who was so absorbed with her problems and so angry about her circumstances that she did not face her problems and did not see that people around her wanted to help her. Finally, her older sister was able to teach her to face her problems, one by one, and to control her pain. Due to her sister’s encouragement the young girl was able to walk through the pain, with hope for a bright future. This short story provides an intimate glimpse of internal pain and shows how easy it is to be overwhelmed by circumstances. The author conveys a powerful and important message about how important it is to look outside yourself for help when help is needed. The War Within Fear, Hate, Madness, Loneliness, and Pain are things we have to face in our lifetime but of course, we all have happy moments and those are the moments we don’t want to ever miss, forget, or ever stop having. This story is about the trials and tribulations of a young girl whose older sister guided her to find the little girl that lives inside. There was a little girl, who one day was laughing, smiling, and enjoying life. She took notice of her own happiness. She knew she was loved. She never wanted to let that go. As time went on, and the girl grew, everything began to change. She began to experience Fear, Hate, Madness, Loneliness, and Pain. So one day, while they were sleeping, she picked them up, put them in a safe, wrapped a heavy chain around the safe, and locked it, so she would never have to feel them again. Unfortunately, soon she found herself running again from Fear, Hate, Madness, Loneliness, and Pain. She would not face them, but they called out for her over and over and she heard their screams. The old chain she had placed around the safe where they were locked got really rusty and old, and they broke free and escaped. No matter how fast she ran, she could not out- run them. They caught her! She was angry — angry at herself and everyone who ever hurt her. She was angry at GOD for giving her a life that only broke her heart. She despised GOD. She disliked everyone. She disliked herself. She felt deserted, forgotten, abandoned, and hurt, and she was afraid that she’d get hurt even more than ever before. She began cutting herself because she felt she need not live. She said, “I’ve had enough!” She continued to cut more and more, and soon it would become an everyday thing. She started getting into drugs, because it all made her feel frozen. She didn’t realize that she had not been deserted. She had an older sister who noticed her pain, and saw what she did to try not to feel the pain. The girl was so caught up in her emotions that she had forgotten everyone around her — she had forgotten herself. The older sister was so worried for the girl. She tried to talk to her, tried to help her, but no matter how hard she tried, the girl would not let her older sister help. The girl was so angry at herself and so angry at the world, that she still didn’t notice her older sister. She was hurt, she was angry and afraid. She was screaming, “HELP” but the only one to hear her was the little girl inside her. The older sister tried to point the girl forward by showing her how to face her problems head on. Her older sister helped her walk through her problems one by one, instead of fighting them. The girl began to feel brave. She began to have hope…. She opened her eyes and was able to see how to walk through her pain. It reminded her of a story someone once told her about a person lost in a dark forest, who never tired of trying to find her way out. She never gave up because the thought of never seeing the people she loved again made her work even harder to escape. When she finally found the light at the end of the dark forest, she was happy again. The days the girl spent lost in the forest trying to find her way out taught her an important lesson — that if you work through all the pain and all the struggles rather than fight them, there is a light. A little guidance from someone who cares, really can impact a person’s way of looking at life. Deanna Rae Chipps, Runner-Up — Middle School 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge; ©2015 Lakota Children’s Enrichment, All Rights Reserved; ©2013, CinMagPhotography It’s Going to Be Okay ~by Ayiannah Carroll ©Lakota Children’s Enrichment, Inc. 2015 #WeAreHere Writing Challenge It’s Going to Be Okay ~ Suicide happens often, but can be prevented. Sometimes people do suicide over break ups, or bullying. There are programs for suicidal thoughts, and they can help. Movies, shows, and friends talk about suicide. Many members in my family have committed suicide. I have a friend and she has parents who drink a lot. She is bullied by a group of girls, who beat her up twice. She never told anyone until she started cutting. I noticed her arms but when I asked, she said it was just a paper cut. I noticed she was hiding something because she never was laughing or being as happy as she was before. Every time I see the group of girls who bully her, I think “why?” She never touched you or talked about you. I would know because she’s my best friend, and she tells me everything... She also gets beat up by her parents — they are just making it worse. Her life is worse then theirs. I always tried to give her the courage to make her feel good about herself. She tried committing suicide three times, and I was there for her. Sometimes I’d ask “why?” She said “I’d rather let the pain inside destroy me than everybody else.” I cry when I see her alive, because that’s how I know she’s okay. People cut, lie, push you away, and cry — that’s because they think they’re supposed to be like that. None of us are perfect. I wanted to tell someone, but she’d never let me and I was scared I might lose her as a friend. After a while she started dating a guy. He was really really nice and sweet to her…. After a little while he was really mean and demanding. She could never talk to any other guys, or even say a boy’s name. I was really worried about her because I thought he was going to hurt her. When she felt uncomfortable around him, he broke up with her. She cried and cried for a long time. When she started cutting again I cried, too, because this time she cut deeper — over the scars from the other cuts. I was really, really worried about her. I called someone for help. When I did, she was really mad at me. I knew it was the right thing to do because she has people who could help her to get better. When they took her away, she never talked to me again. I never see her now, because I can’t. She has not gotten better and people call her “crazy.” Everyone was talking about her, and it was so annoying knowing how many people hated my best friend. So remember if you’re ever dealing with suicidal thoughts, call for help. There are people who are there for you, and you’re never alone. Never think about suicide because people are going to miss you. Call for help and always think bright.

There was a little girl, who one day was laughing, smiling, and enjoying life. She took notice of her own happiness. She knew she was loved. She never wanted to let that go. As time went on, and the girl grew, everything began to change. She began to experience Fear, Hate, Madness, Loneliness, and Pain. So one day, while they were sleeping, she picked them up, put them in a safe, wrapped a heavy chain around the safe, and locked it, so she would never have to feel them again. Unfortunately, soon she found herself running again from Fear, Hate, Madness, Loneliness, and Pain. She would not face them, but they called out for her over and over and she heard their screams. The old chain she had placed around the safe where they were locked got really rusty and old, and they broke free and escaped. No matter how fast she ran, she could not out- run them. They caught her! She was angry — angry at herself and everyone who ever hurt her. She was angry at GOD for giving her a life that only broke her heart. She despised GOD. She disliked everyone. She disliked herself. She felt deserted, forgotten, abandoned, and hurt, and she was afraid that she’d get hurt even more than ever before. She began cutting herself because she felt she need not live. She said, “I’ve had enough!” She continued to cut more and more, and soon it would become an everyday thing. She started getting into drugs, because it all made her feel frozen. She didn’t realize that she had not been deserted. She had an older sister who noticed her pain, and saw what she did to try not to feel the pain. The girl was so caught up in her emotions that she had forgotten everyone around her — she had forgotten herself. The older sister was so worried for the girl. She tried to talk to her, tried to help her, but no matter how hard she tried, the girl would not let her older sister help. The girl was so angry at herself and so angry at the world, that she still didn’t notice her older sister. She was hurt, she was angry and afraid. She was screaming, “HELP” but the only one to hear her was the little girl inside her. The older sister tried to point the girl forward by showing her how to face her problems head on. Her older sister helped her walk through her problems one by one, instead of fighting them. The girl began to feel brave. She began to have hope…. She opened her eyes and was able to see how to walk through her pain. It reminded her of a story someone once told her about a person lost in a dark forest, who never tired of trying to find her way out. She never gave up because the thought of never seeing the people she loved again made her work even harder to escape. When she finally found the light at the end of the dark forest, she was happy again. The days the girl spent lost in the forest trying to find her way out taught her an important lesson — that if you work through all the pain and all the struggles rather than fight them, there is a light. A little guidance from someone who cares, really can impact a person’s way of looking at life.

It’s Going to Be Okay~ Suicide happens often, but can be prevented. Sometimes people do suicide over break ups, or bullying. There are programs for suicidal thoughts, and they can help. Movies, shows, and friends talk about suicide. Many members in my family have committed suicide. I have a friend and she has parents who drink a lot. She is bullied by a group of girls, who beat her up twice. She never told anyone until she started cutting. I noticed her arms but when I asked, she said it was just a paper cut. I noticed she was hiding something because she never was laughing or being as happy as she was before. Every time I see the group of girls who bully her, I think “why?” She never touched you or talked about you. I would know because she’s my best friend, and she tells me everything... She also gets beat up by her parents — they are just making it worse. Her life is worse then theirs. I always tried to give her the courage to make her feel good about herself. She tried committing suicide three times, and I was there for her. Sometimes I’d ask “why?” She said “I’d rather let the pain inside destroy me than everybody else.” I cry when I see her alive, because that’s how I know she’s okay. People cut, lie, push you away, and cry — that’s because they think they’re supposed to be like that. None of us are perfect. I wanted to tell someone, but she’d never let me and I was scared I might lose her as a friend. After a while she started dating a guy. He was really really nice and sweet to her…. After a little while he was really mean and demanding. She could never talk to any other guys, or even say a boy’s name. I was really worried about her because I thought he was going to hurt her. When she felt uncomfortable around him, he broke up with her. She cried and cried for a long time. When she started cutting again I cried, too, because this time she cut deeper — over the scars from the other cuts. I was really, really worried about her. I called someone for help. When I did, she was really mad at me. I knew it was the right thing to do because she has people who could help her to get better. When they took her away, she never talked to me again. I never see her now, because I can’t. She has not gotten better and people call her “crazy.” Everyone was talking about her, and it was so annoying knowing how many people hated my best friend. So remember if you’re ever dealing with suicidal thoughts, call for help. There are people who are there for you, and you’re never alone. Never think about suicide because people are going to miss you. Call for help and always think bright.

(AP Photo/David Mercer) The Associated Press | FILE - In this July 14, 1970, file photo, National League's Pete Rose, left, is hugged by his teammate Dick Dietz while American League's catcher Ray Fosse lies injured on the ground, after Rose crashed into him to score the game-winning run for the National League team, in the 12th inning of the 1970 All-Star Game, in Cincinnati. Fosse's body still aches all over 45 years later. He never did fully recover physically from one of most infamous plays in All-Star Game history when he was bulled over by Pete Rose. (AP Photo/File) CINCINNATI (AP) — A photograph of the bat and ball from Pete Rose's record-setting 4,192nd hit has adorned the back of the enormous video board at Great American Ball Park for a dozen years, reminding everyone of one of the city's biggest sports moments. It's also a reminder of something more: Even with the gambling scandal, a lifetime ban and the fact that he hasn't lived in Cincinnati for a long time, this is still Pete's place. Baseball's hits king remains revered in his hometown, no matter how much evidence surfaces about how he violated the sport's cardinal rule by betting on baseball. For a generation, he represented Reds baseball with his grit and hustle. Still does for many Cincinnatians, who will get another chance to cheer him during the All-Star Game at Great American next week. \"When you play in your hometown and you're a great player like Pete was, you've got to be loved,\" said Hall of Famer Tony Perez, a teammate on the Big Red Machine in the 1970s. \"The people appreciate what I did for the team and the great years I had here, which is why they love me, too. But it's different. When it's your home and you're doing great, they love you more.\" They've never stopped loving him, even though he's been banned from the sport since 1989 for betting on baseball. The Reds have moved into a new ballpark since then, and Rose's fingerprints are all over the place. Beyond the photo that was replaced by one of many All-Star Game banners throughout the stadium last week, the ballpark is located on Pete Rose Way, which was named before before his gambling scandal. Fans in Rose jerseys dot the stands at home games. The team's adjacent Hall of Fame includes Rose prominently in the displays. A rose garden just outside the ballpark marks the spot where his record-breaking hit landed at old Riverfront Stadium in 1985. The 74-year-old hits king visits town a few times a year and attends games, sitting in the seats like any other fan. When he's shown on the video screen, fans cheer and chant \"Pete! Pete! Pete!\" Those chants will fill Pete Rose Way again next week before the All-Star Game. Rose is being honored in Major League Baseball's Franchise Four promotion — fans got to pick four top players from each team. Rose says Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Barry Larkin also were chosen to represent Cincinnati's baseball tradition. How will everyone react when he makes a rare on-field appearance with baseball's permission? \"I don't know what kind of reception (to expect),\" Rose said recently. \"When you're walking out alongside Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan, a pretty good reception, you would think.\" Oh, he knows. It'll be loud. And everybody knows what they'll be yelling. Larkin is also a Cincinnati native who played for the Reds in the 1980s when Rose was the player/manager. He understands what Rose's presence on the field will mean for the city. \"It's unfortunate the way it's gone down over the last 25 years or whatever it's been,\" Larkin said. \"I think Pete's role can be very significant. I felt bad that some players didn't have the opportunity that I had to just pick his brain and access all of the information that he has that he can provide. \"His participation will be well-received by the players, and I know the city will be very excited as well,\" Larkin said. Outside the city, it's a different story. Former major league pitcher Curt Schilling said this week that he's disappointed in how Rose's situation gets so much attention. \"I guess I'm a little tired of his story overselling, overplaying other things like the Hall of Fame weekend,\" Schilling said in a conference call about the home run derby. \"Every weekend at the Hall of Fame when guys are getting inducted, there's always Pete Rose stories. I think we're going to get the same thing at the All-Star Game. He's going to be the story.\" Fans back home loved his head-first dives, the way he went chin-to-chin against players from the big-market teams and made small-town Cincinnati a back-to-back World Series champion. They love his Charlie Hustle. Always have. \"I remember 1960 my first year in Geneva, the way Pete played,\" Perez said, during a recent visit to Cincinnati with the Marlins. \"He wasn't the player he was later, but he hustled. He only played half a year in Geneva, but he was the most popular player because of the way he played.\" The betting scandal and lifetime ban tarnished his image around the country, but fans in his hometown have stood behind him, forgiving his transgressions. \"They should just let it go and put him in the Hall of Fame,\" said Curt Miller, 47, attending a recent Reds game. \"Everybody deserves a second chance.\" ___ Follow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay",

So according to @CNNPolitics \u0026 @evanperez, anything not a straight party line vote is now 'bipartisan'. — Dread Pirate Cates (@drawandstrike) July 10, 2015. @evanperez You realize you're now the laughingstock of political Twitter for trying this creative use of the word 'bipartisan', right? — Dread Pirate Cates (@drawandstrike) July 10, 2015. @evanperez defending story saying he didn't \"write the tweet\"…..Holy Mother of God. Dude. Seriously. @CNN — QueenofSheba (@lisasdeang) July 10, 2015. @evanperez youre a complete hack. jeezus. how do you sleep at night after publishing this crap? — J (@JWoodOMFS) July 10, 2015. Fair question. Awesome to see @evanperez being absolutely OWNED by @AceofSpadesHQ on Archuleta aftermath. — featherchick (@featherchick) July 10, 2015. Heck yeah, it is. Which is why we’ll let Ace have the last word: . @evanperez did Obama, who appointed her, or the 55 Democrats who confirmed her (55-0), have any comment or regrets, I wonder? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. .@evanperez is it just the GOP who are supposed to be on patrol for Obama's reckless incompetence? Doesn't he have some responsibility? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. what is your username on @HuffPoPol, @evanperez? are you a super-user? Do you post at @Salon, too? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. i also like how @evanperez quotes the claims that Republicans are responsible, *without attributing from whom he got this spin* — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. this is attribution bias– @CNN is always upfront about saying \"Republicans attack,\" but Dem attacks are always immacuately conceived — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. Dem attacks are never Dem attacks — they are simply \"facts\" that the Reporter has discovered through his own investigations. — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. no that's not what I mean — I mean he was fed this angle, Cherchez Les Republicaines, by a Dem Spinner @evanperez — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. @AceofSpadesHQ Well @evanperez claims GOP aides…but note there's not one actual quote. — Just Karl (@justkarl) July 10, 2015. this isn't what I mean. I mean he was fed this spin by a Democrat hack, then wrote it up, but does not admit… @justkarl @evanperez — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. …\"Democrat officials counter-charged that Republicans were too concerned about O-care to look into Archuletta\" @justkarl @evanperez — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. He does not admit that he served as stenographer for the WH @justkarl @evanperez — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. @AceofSpadesHQ I also screengrabbed the 'bipartisan support' quote, just in case they try to change it later. pic.twitter.com/3onnWMhEpT — Dread Pirate Cates (@drawandstrike) July 10, 2015. bipartisan support: Dems vote for her 55-0; Republicans vote AGAINST her 35-8 @drawandstrike — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. btw I'm sure the 8 Republicans that voted for this walking disaster are the same eight the media gets wet about with their \"evolutions\" — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. BREAKING: @evanperez reports that Republican aides confess to taking part in fraternity hazing rape of Jackie — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. Ouch. will the Hispanic pressure groups that forced this incompetent hack on the nation be apologizing to our jeopardized troops? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. .@evanperez any regrets from the Hispanic pressure groups that promised to punish Republicans for voting against this hack? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. .@evanperez since you're casting far and wide for Root Causes — how about the Hispanic groups that insisted on this incompetent? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. I don't want to do it, but can someone call these hispanic pressure groups and ask them if they will be apologizing to the troops for OPM? — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. obviously @CNN and @evanperez will not be doing so. They have found their fallguys, and, get this, it's the GOP. — TheUltraYachtLife (@AceofSpadesHQ) July 10, 2015. Same as it ever was. *** Related:",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Twins have shown interest in free agent righthander and former closer Neftali Feliz, according to a source with knowledge of their interest. Feliz, just 27, posted a 4.58 ERA in 18 games with the Rangers before being designated for assignment July 3. He cleared waivers but, as a player with at least five seasons of service time, rejected an outright assignment to the minors to become a free agent. Feliz broke into the majors throwing fastballs of 100 miles-per-hour. He was the Rangers closer for their World Series years of 2010 and 2011 and was an All-Star in 2010. He doesn't reach 100 anymore but his fastball averaged 93.8 mph this season, according to fangraphs.com. He had Tommy John surgery in 2012 and returned late in 2013. The Twins are looking for bullpen help, and Feliz could help them in the sixth and seventh innings. They will likely take a look at Feliz's medicals before proceeding, A handful of other clubs also have expressed interest in Feliz. After the game, there were rumblings that Feliz was going to land with the Tigers. There have been no other reports on this, so we will see. Now for some quick thoughts following a wild night at Target. I was stunned to see Eddie Rosario steal second in the ninth. He was initially called out but replays showed he was safe. The Twins dodged a bullet. Twins manager Paul Molitor took some of blame for how he communicated to Rosario. Rosario was not behind held at first, so he had the option of getting a walking lead and taking off for second if Soria picked up his leg. Soria did, but Rosario didn't get as big of a lead as he should have, making the play much closer than it should have been. Ervin Santana gave up a solo home run, a two-run homer and a three-run shot over four innings in his Target Field debut. \"You make a mistake against that team, they've got a lot of power,'' he said. Santana just wasn't sharp. His home run balls caught too much of the plate and his slider lacked bite. The Twins comeback doesn't happen with J.R. Graham pitching three scoreless innings in relief of Santana. He was followed by Ryan O'Rourke, who pitched a scoreless eighth. Trevor May pitched the ninth and got the win. \"They don't seem so significant at the time,'' Molitor said. La Velle E. Neal III has covered baseball for the Star Tribune since 1998 (the post-Knoblauch era). Born and raised in Chicago, he grew up following the White Sox and hating the Cubs. He attended both the University of Illinois and Illinois-Chicago and began his baseball writing career at the Kansas City Star. He can be heard occasionally on KFAN radio, lending his great baseball mind to Paul Allen and other hosts. Mark Rosen borrows him occasionally for WCCO-TV. Phil Miller covered three seasons of Twins baseball, but that was at a different ballpark for a different newspaper. Now Miller returns to the baseball beat after joining the Star Tribune as the Gopher football writer in 2010, and he won't miss the dingy dome for a minute. In addition to the Twins and Gophers, Miller covered the Utah Jazz and the NBA for six years at The Salt Lake Tribune.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday is Comic-Con's sucker baby — a day so easy you don't know what everyone was warning you about. We pretty much walked into the infamous Hall H on the first morning of Comic-Con 2015 — no wristbands and little waiting required. But there were already people camped out in line for the next day's panels, the wristbands for which wouldn't get handed out for 12 hours. The first panel of the day was reserved for Open Road, the distributor behind such films as \"Dope\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" With no description in the schedule, most, if not all, of those in attendance were just waiting around for something else later in the day — the \"Hunger Games\" panel or \"Doctor Who.\" When its start time came and went, some in my section speculated that it'd just been canceled. Then Bill Murray entered the room. Open Road used its hour in Hall H to promote \"Rock the Kasbah,\" a comedy in which Murray stars as a rock music manager who discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice in Afghanistan. It co-stars Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan and Danny McBride, but all the movie needs to drum excitement is Murray, and the marketers know that. He entered through the crowd and answered the moderator's first question in character. The name cards on the dais often give away who's on-hand, but his read, \"Richie Lanz.\" In his first-ever Comic-Con appearance, Murray played to the crowd. \"I feel like I fit in,\" he said. \"I feel like I could fall down in any of these aisles right here and be left alone until I woke.\" What followed was a master class in fan appreciation. By turns funny and gracious, he flirted back when one woman offered to let him spend the night with her on the convention-center lawn. He encouraged a young man who was so nervous that his knees were shaking to move the shaking up to his hips and then to his arms; the kid did, dancing in front of thousands. He was philosophical and sincere, greeting even the most awkward and rambling questions with wit and grace. “I must say it feels wonderful to be in this room,” Murray said. “I like when people get excited about something. There’s a lot of people who don’t get excited about much at all.” With no warning that he’d even be there, it’s likely that no one in Hall H on Thursday morning was there to see Bill Murray. And “Rock the Kasbah” isn’t your typical Comic-Con film. But the move got some of the world’s most rabid pop-culture fans some face-time with one of the industry’s most personable stars — and got Open Road’s little movie in front of them.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Pope Francis is finishing the second leg of his Latin American trip in Bolivia, and is now boarding the plane to go to Paraguay. Last night was the big speech of his trip. He managed to tie together both a historic apology to his fellow Latin Americans about the Roman Catholic Church’s role in the abuses of the colonial era and position the church as an agent against what he called a \"new colonialism.\" This has landed with a bang in Latin America, but also in the rest of the world. This speech in Bolivia will make his September trip to the United States very interesting. His attack on the global economic system could be read as a stern critique of some aspects of American capitalism. Francis remains difficult to define. He doesn’t appear to be the sort of radical leftist like President Evo Morales of Bolivia. There were some moments on this trip that seemed to catch him off guard, like when Mr. Morales gave him a cross shaped like a hammer and sickle. The pope smiled and seemed to hand it off as quickly as he could. Pope Francis is back at the Vatican, after an eight-day tour of Latin America in which he seemed to accomplish his goals for the trip. His big speech in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was the defining thematic moment, as he twinned a historic apology for the Roman Catholic Church’s complicity in Spanish colonialism in Latin America with a blunt criticism of a “new colonialism” at a global level, rooted in materialism, inequality and a profit mentality. He attracted huge, enthusiastic crowds and received blanket media coverage in the countries he visited, Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. And yet the pope, an Argentine, also showed little interest in involving himself too deeply in the political squabbles of his home continent. He preached unity and refrained from directly scolding political leaders, or wading into sensitive issues, such as freedom of expression in Ecuador, even when activists in some countries were eager for him to do so. Perhaps environmentalists will be the happiest, since he regularly expressed, in broad terms, his message of fighting ecological degradation and climate change. The focus will now shift to Francis’ September trip to Cuba and the United States. On Sunday night, as his papal jetliner was returning to Rome, Francis signaled that he knew his economic message was already facing criticism in the United States and pledged to study it. Some critics blame him for rebuking capitalism with an unduly broad brush. Others say he ignores that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. This is one reason the visit to the United States is likely to be more complicated for Francis, even as he is certain to attract large crowds and a warm welcome. A NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll in April showed that 55 percent of Americans have a positive view of the pope, compared with only 6 percent who have a negative view. Any politician would dream of those numbers. I’m planning to travel with Francis again in September and am looking forward to reporting on the trip up close. He will speak before Congress and at the United Nations, so on the biggest stages. It should be a lot of fun. Many thanks to everyone who followed this notebook, or who kept up on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Thanks again. It was great fun. Before we boarded the papal airline on Sunday for the long flight back to Rome, the debate had begun: What questions would we ask the pope? And who would ask them? Pope Francis has made it a tradition to hold a mid-air news conference on the return trip of any of his international flights. For reporters, it is our chance to directly question the pope on tough issues and see how he responds. First, though, comes a process. The traveling press pool is too big for everyone to ask a question, yet it is too diverse to allow only one or two journalists to handle the job. First dibs always go to reporters from the countries visited during the trip. A reporter from each country can ask a question, in this case, from Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. Then it gets trickier. Groups are divided by language. Journalist from Spanish-speaking countries cluster together, as do the Italians, the English speakers and other Europeans. Within groups, reporters discuss, debate and argue about which questions to ask; then they discuss, debate and argue about how to phrase the questions; and then they discuss, debate and argue about who gets to ask the question. This time there was also discussion, debate and argument about what language would be used to ask the questions. Usually, it is Italian, but with so many Spanish speakers on board, the decision was to do both (which makes translating things trickier). The main goal is to elicit an answer from Francis that makes news. During his first on-flight press conference, Francis was asked about homosexuals and famously responded, \"Who am I to judge?\" On another flight, he confirmed his belief that mankind is at least partly responsible for climate change. This time, we in the English-language group want him to discuss his remarks about capitalism. We want to know if he is attacking the American way of life. Update: Just landed in Rome. Interesting press conference. By mutual consent, we are embargoing our stories until 4 p.m. CEST. Take a look very soon. Update: Here's my article on the news conference aboard the papal airplane.",
    "LabBody": "July 9, 2015 On Tuesday night, I was crawling into bed, exhausted, when I checked my Twitter feed and noticed a post, with photographs, addressed to me. Protesters were holding candles and waving Ecuadorean flags in the photos. happening now at the Hotel entrance. Ecuadorian Journalist for PressFreedom PLS Listen. I sighed. My hotel bed was comfortable. Maybe this was just a prank. I got dressed, took the elevator to the lobby and checked the front door. Nothing. Inside the expansive media center provided for reporters traveling with Pope Francis, desserts were arrayed on a table. Several journalists were still filing stories. Normal. Another hotel entrance was nearby, but a security officer had blocked it by erecting a temporary wall decorated with images of Francis. Odd. I wiggled around the wall but saw nothing suspicious. I sent a response on Twitter from the lobby and returned to my room: just walked downstairs but didn’t see anyone. I got back in bed and made another final check of my phone. Another Twitter message awaited, this one with a photo showing the wall I had wiggled around. I hadn’t looked hard enough. The journalists about 80 are on the street. MainEntrance. Clothes back on, down the elevator again, this time with genuine curiosity. Outside the hotel, I found five people holding one Ecuadorean flag, the stragglers from the larger rally in the original photograph. I told them social media must still be free, given how they had tracked me down. They laughed. “Social media is the only freedom that we still have,” said Maria-Laura Patiño, one of the group. With the world’s media at their doorstep, they had staged a small demonstration outside our hotel to draw attention to one of the ironies of Francis' trip to Ecuador. Even as the government has treated us like visiting dignitaries, journalists in Ecuador are under intense pressure. Ecuador’s Constitution provides freedom of expression, but civil society leaders say the reality is far different, as newspapers and journalists critical of the government of President Rafael Correa can face legal prosecution and other pressures. “We are just citizens,” Isabel Proano told me, “and we wanted to bring attention to the issue of freedom of expression – which we had none of.” We talked for a while and they wandered home, as I returned to my room and flipped open my laptop to search \"Ecuador\" and \"freedom of expression.\" I had known that the Correa government had been criticized for quashing dissent, but the search results were revealing. Freedom House, the global watchdog organization that ranks countries on freedom of expression, rated Ecuador this year as \"not free\". It accused Mr. Correa and other political leaders of creating a hostile environment for the media, and using a 2013 communications law as a tool to intimidate and legally sanction critics in the media. Mr. Correa also has filed several criminal and civil defamation cases against critical journalists. Next, I found a news release by the Committee to Protect Journalists, dated June 16, barely three weeks before Francis arrived. It described how Ecuador’s state media oversight commission had fined an independent daily newspaper, El Universo, about $350,000. Why? In March, El Universo published an exposé alleging problems at state-run hospitals. Journalists attempted to interview the government official in charge but got no reply. The day after the story was published, Mr. Correa criticized it on Twitter, arguing it had failed to allow a government response. Doing so, under Ecuadorean law, is punishable. A government minister ordered El Universo to publish the state's long rebuttal. The newspaper complied, but wrote its own headlines and did not publish government-drafted summaries that claimed the original story was designed to trick readers. Boom. A $350,000 fine. You can find example after example if you keep searching. I was reminded of one of the inevitable compromises of being inside any traveling media bubble. You go through a country, but you are not really in it. The traveling papal media gets trays of empanadas and sliced fruit. The locals get fined.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The trio of brothers running Sunshine Market in Lynnwood, at the corner of 212th Street SW and 44th Avenue W, are serious about their fruits and vegetables.They stand behind their products, support local farmers and try to be there for their customers nearly every day of the year, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and until 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, said Noor Almtowaq, 29. And they'll stay open later if a customer drives in at closing time, he said.He's the eldest brother and the driving force behind the purchase of the stand, which they opened in September 2013.“Noor's the heart of the entire business,” said 26-year-old Alex.Yet Noor now works at Microsoft, finding time mainly on weekends and some nights for Sunshine Market, and it's Alex who's hooked on produce.“He has so much passion for the business,” said younger brother Josh, 22. “It's like he fell in love with produce.”Alex agreed and said he's not likely to fall out of love anytime soon either. In fact, he's searching for a site for a second, bigger store where he can expand the selection. He dreams of a string of stores offering both conventional and organic produce. He said there's a science to understanding how fruits and vegetables work — “for example, potatoes hate light, bananas love heat, asparagus loves water” — and in understanding how to sell produce.“When you put tomatoes, basil, eggplants and ginger next to each other,” he said, “it's a guarantee you're going to sell them all.”He's always been interested in how things work. Younger brother Josh said Alex was the kind of kid who was forever taking things apart and putting them back together. He studied at Edmonds Community College and earned an engineering degree from the University of Washington, because he wanted to understand the technology behind materials like concrete.“I'm an inventor and my imagination was limited because I didn't understand the materials, so it limited me,” Alex said. Understanding materials “grew my imagination,” he said.The brothers didn't start out planning to go into the produce business.“I didn't even know what cilantro was, to be honest,” Josh said.Prodded by Noor, they were just looking for a business. And they liked the Lynnwood location. Perched on a hilltop at a busy intersection with three corners anchored in Mountlake Terrace, the site overlooks a Lynnwood business district and streets leading to the Alderwood Mall and I-5. It's housed a produce stand at various times in the past, as well as a coffee stand, sometimes both at once. But there were few, if any, improvements to the building and nothing seemed to last for long. That changed when the Almtowaq brothers took over the site. It was Alex who almost singlehandedly rebuilt the building, doing everything the city would let him do by himself. He redid the electrical and plumbing, built the shelves and an awning for shade. He installed new siding and garage doors that can slide up to open an entire side of the building. “He built this whole entire building all by himself,” Josh said. “He's really smart. I used to come down and watch him.”Todd Hall, planning manager for the City of Lynnwood community development, said the brothers made “significant modifications” to the building and their business is apparently running smoothly.“Since they've come in, we haven't had any complaints or anything,” Hall said. “It seems to be going really well.”The brothers said they made a lot of mistakes and their first customers didn't expect Sunshine Market to last long.At first, they didn't have proper coolers and their produce wasn't being sprayed with water to keep it fresh. So Alex installed coolers and bought the software for a state-of-the-art sprinkler system. “My spinach now lasts two weeks,” he said. “I won't leave it in the store two weeks, but it lasts two weeks. When I first opened, I couldn't even get it to last three days.”Customer Kainitra Crammer, who lives in Bothell but works near Sunshine Market, said she loves the freshness of the produce. She can put it in her fruit bowl and it won't attract fruit flies because it's not spoiling right away, she said. “It's not the grocery store's produce,” she said, “and you can clearly tell, because of the way it lasts.”The brothers order from independent local farmers and smaller outfits like Peterson Fruit Co., a family-owned business in Mukilteo. Often it's a customer request that brings a new product into the store. That's how the brothers started carrying raw milk from Jackie's Jersey Milk in Bellingham. They started out selling 18 bottles a week and now sell 90.They also sell fresh goat milk, which is even harder to find; theirs comes from Lucky Hook Farm in Moses Lake.“People drive from like, Arlington and stuff, just to come buy it,” Josh said.They also sell organic eggs from Stiebrs Farms in Yelm, fresh every three days, he said. And duck eggs, which he described as “a very rich egg” beloved by Asians. Another big seller is their raw honey, purchased from a beekeeper with 46 beehives ranging from Mill Creek to Walla Walla, Josh said.“It is like, the best honey out there,” he said, adding, “We believe 110 percent in our honey.”There are also familiar items like chocolate milk from Twin Brooks Creamery in Lynden, coconut water, Bulgarian feta cheese and Beechers Cheese. Other jarred and canned products give a nod to the brothers' Middle Eastern roots. There's olive oil from Lebanon and Tunisia, coriander from Pakistan, Turkish figs, dolmas and cornichons, tahini paste and dates.Although they consider themselves Americans, the brothers fled with their family from Iraq in 1992, in the wake of the first Gulf War. Aided by Red Cross and United Nations workers after crossing into Saudi Arabia, the Almtowaqs made their way to Washington state, living in Everett for a time and then Lynnwood. His family history may explain in part why Alex has studied philosophy and history and seems just as prone to discussing Plato, Socrates and Galileo as he is to talking produce.Indeed, the conversation at Sunshine Market seems to be part of the customer service.“One of the coolest things here is being able to meet with the brothers,” said store regular Doug Clark, maneuvering through the market in his wheelchair. “And since I'm disabled, they actually have excellent customer service.”He's also partial to the produce, he said.“I've gone up to the Yakima fruit stand, just to compare prices and quality,” he said, “and I just turned around and came back here.”Retired media-arts teacher Claire Beach, of Edmonds, called Alex's impassioned explanations his “TED talks,” referring to the short, powerful talks made popular by the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences.She chatted with Alex on a recent visit, but that didn't distract her from the produce, which she said has helped her recover from a serious illness. She's been following an anti-inflammatory diet, including cutting down on carbs, and has lost 40 pounds and regained her vigor, she said.“This is the first time in my life I'm eating what my body wants,” said Beach, adding that she grew up in the South. “I was raised in Betty Crocker Land.”Customers like Beach are inspiring, Alex said.“When people come back and they tell you they feel better, healthier, stronger — it's a good feeling,” he said. “It keeps you going.”He could be making a lot more money as an engineer, but said he doesn't like sitting behind a desk.“Engineering is a hobby,” he said. “It's something I do because I love it.“But selling produce is different. You're selling something that feeds the entire world.”",

Well, thanks to Peeta himself (aka Josh Hutcherson), he sort of maaaaaybe accidentally let it slip that there could be more Hunger Games movies coming our way. The trio of Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth are all at Comic-Con right now, and following their panel in Hall H yesterday, the three stars headed over to tape an episode of Conan (Conan O’Brien also moderated their panel, like that’s not a big deal or anything). After Lawrence broke out into song, Conan asked about future plans for the series, and if we might see more Hunger Games movies down the road. Which would be exciting, because there have been rumors about Hunger Games prequels, sequels, and spinoffs —unconfirmed rumors, that go back to January of this year. But nothing ever materialized out of them. That is, until last night, when Conan asked the group if “[there’s] going to be a sequel?

Conan mentions that Hutcherson is the worst liar he’s ever seen. It appears as if Lionsgate (the studio behind the Hunger Games movies) was watching the Conan episode, and immediately squashed the rumor, saying that there are no more planned Hunger Games movies coming. But then again, I’m pretty sure Katniss was told she’d never have to go back into the Hunger Games arena and LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. What makes this even more peculiar is that the video of this Hunger Games admission appears to have been scrubbed from the internet. Like, completely.

We need more Hunger Games in our life, and whether it ends up being a prequel story, or a straight spinoff about Peeta and Katniss (and their kids?!) we’ll be there.

    "DiffbotBody": "Let’s just get this out of the way: Mortal Kombat X is the best Mortal Kombat, period. It’s deeper, mechanically richer, and more fully featured than any of the nine games before it, hands down. On top of that, developer NetherRealm Studios has taken a bunch of risks by adding eight entirely new characters to the MK roster, while introducing fun, distinct variations to returning ones. Each of these risks pays off to varying degrees, but they also serve to highlight some of the ways in which the franchise is stuck in the past. Mortal Kombat X is an excellent fighter, and the most fun I’ve ever had with a Mortal Kombat game. The first thing MKX does to make itself feel new and exciting to both old series fans and casual fighters is a major roster shakeup. Before DLC ever enters the picture, MKX sports a respectable 24 fighters, and a whopping one third of those are honest-to-goodness new characters; not palette swaps or tweaked alternate versions of existing ones. Few fighting games with such a deep vault of fan-favorite characters have cleaned house so completely, and MKX is so much the better for it. Sure, I go way back with guys like Kabal and Smoke, but fresh faces like Takeda and Kung Jin bring so much novelty to the table gameplay-wise that it’s hard to be sad about their absence. Takeda is the most eye-catching new design, and he exemplifies what MKX does right with its new characters. He fights like you’d imagine a 21st-century ninja might, with an interesting mix of traditional weaponry and high-tech gadgetry. He’s got remote-controlled laser swords he can plant and recall at will, explosive kunai throwing knives, and arm-mounted, retractable grappling hooks that can open up into imposing blade-covered whips. He wields it all with a confident martial arts swagger that makes it all seem somehow plausible. In fact, everyone conveys their fighting style more effectively than in NetherRealms’ prior games thanks to the much-improved animations. Injustice was a step in the right direction of addressing the shortcomings of 2011’s Mortal Kombat , but MKX gets the rest of the way there: dash and hit animations no longer look like hapless flailing, for instance. Little details like this used to distract me from the fighting all the time, and I’m glad to see them finally ironed out. This helps MKX feel like the smoothest-playing Mortal Kombat ever. Walk speeds are snappier, pokes feel more useful, and with the awesome new variation system, there’s more to explore, discover, and exploit than ever before. Liu Kang has a variation where he can switch on the fly between healing and damaging stances, new grappler Torr employs an assist character to double-team opponents, Kotal Khan can place totems to grant himself temporary buffs – this is the kind of stuff you see in Persona 4 or BlazBlue, and seeing NetherRealms open up so many fun new doors is really refreshing. One mild distraction from the excellent combat though, is the visual inconsistency between characters. Some fighters, like Scorpion or newcomer D’vorah, look excellent, with tons of little details in their faces and costumes. Others, like Sonya and Jacqui, look far less detailed, with comparatively plain facial textures. It stands out because of the high peaks MKX hits during its best moments. With two of the better-looking fighters duking it out against one of the many beautiful backgrounds, it’s one of the best-looking console games around, so it sticks out when everything isn’t up to the same high quality level. The inconsistency that sticks out the most for me though, is the content of MKX’s so-so story mode, and how completely at odds it is with the aesthetic Mortal Kombat has built over the years. Again, NetherRealms has created something substantial for folks who like having a single-player experience, but it’s far less successful than previous attempts. The spotty writing and voice acting are largely to blame, but the real issue is that it’s weaving a tale of family and young adults coming of age in a world about death and brutality. Without the storytelling wit to do something interesting and unpredictable, it’s simply a poor fit. The chapters set in a civil war-torn Outworld fit the Mortal Kombat tone the best, but there is just no reconciling the feel-good tale of a single father who loves his daughter in story mode with the image of him gleefully tearing a hole in her chest and proudly standing over her dead body in every other mode. Yes, of course, Mortal Kombat is ostensibly “about” Fatalities, and they’re gorier and more satisfying here than ever, but MKX’s story mode also wants to be about characters with deep ties to one another: fathers and sons, estranged lovers, budding romance, and long-standing blood-feuds finally laid to rest. Adding all of that drama to a series that began as a thrown-together story of a bunch of loners fighting to their deaths for their own reasons in strange, dangerous-feeling places leaves MKX feeling a bit confused in that regard. There’s a small bit of this inner conflict in the excellent combat engine as well, but fortunately it matters far less. The bi-directional block button is back, and after being free of it in Injustice it simply feels limiting. Scream sacrilege all you’d like, the block button is a poor mechanic. It completely removes the left/right mixup that cross-ups are supposed to create in 2D fighters, eliminating an entire axis of mind games and setups. Still, there’s a ton of depth to mine here. Each character has a long list of attacks and combo chains that serve different purposes, from high/low mixups to safe block strings and juggle starters. X-Rays, the MK equivalent of super moves, have been retuned to be more worth the resources they cost to execute and throws can be canceled out of and linked into full combos, giving you another meaningful way to spend meter. This makes resource management decisions that much richer. Most importantly, the ability to choose between three version of every character means there will be more matchup-specific stuff to learn, since playing against Sonya’s martial arts-focused Special Forces variant won’t prepare you for the setups she can create with her Demolitions style. That’s what really matters in the end. Sure, the three or four-hour story mode experience feels middling and largely out of place, but that’s not what a fighting game is. It’s endless nights in the lab, months and years of experimentation and discovery, and the joy of outsmarting your opponent. Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game – sometimes in spite of its own heritage – but great all the same. The netcode is mostly up to the task of keeping online fights reasonably smooth, but there was usually just enough input lag to throw off my combos or punish timings relative to what I’m used to playing locally. Still, that’s a huge improvement over Mortal Kombat 9, and while online isn’t a replacement for in-person competition, it’s close enough to keep me learning and playing for a long time. One more thing that will keep me coming back is the returning Krypt, where you unlock MKX’s humorously massive cadre of costumes, finishers, and supplemental materials. More than ever before, this interactive unlockable menu feels like a game of its own. There’s a certain thrill to spending your hard-earned “koins” to open up treasure chests that could have anything in them. That joy is somewhat dampened by the knowledge that you can just buy your way out of the entire thing with a separate $20 unlock key. It’s not the only thing that’s been monetized, sadly: new options for executing easy, two-button Fatalities or skipping story or tower fights require tokens, which are also sold on PSN and XBL. It’s worth noting I never felt outright pushed to get any of this stuff, but between all that and the big “push X to buy Goro” message that appears when you cursor over him on the character-select screen, it’s a bit too much in-game marketing for me to be okay with. It didn’t impact my enjoyment of the experience exactly, but even a hair more aggressive, and it would have. It’s sad that we’re even in that territory. Story only matters so much in a fighting game. Combat is king, and there’s a ton of depth to mine from Mortal Kombat X. A much-needed transfusion of new blood, along with the ability to choose between three variations of every character means we’ll be learning, grinding, and discovering for a long time to come. Its universe keeps getting harder and harder to take seriously, and its microtransactions are borderline gross, but Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game all the same.

Read More [Editor’s Note: Be sure to join IGN and Harmonix for the world gameplay premiere of Rock Band 4 in our live stream on Friday, May 15 at 12pm PT/3pm ET/7pm GMT. That's 5am AEST on Saturday.] Many would agree that Rock Band 2 was the peak of Rock Band’s campaign design. Rock Band 4 aims to outperform the 2008 game’s limited story elements and band interaction with a simple, strong new feature: Gigs. “A gig is a new structure that we’ve put into Rock Band 4 to sort of capture the feeling of a live performance,” Lead Designer Chris Foster told IGN. It’s also an incredible way to have an extra layer of fun, or cause tension with, the people you’re playing with. Here’s hoping Rock Band 4 doesn’t cause any band breakups. You'll 'as a band' be able to vote on a setlist. Foster explained that the act of performing live music isn’t represented completely accurately in previous Rock Band games. You don’t hop on stage, play a song, and leave. “It’s sort of the ebb and flow of the arc of a performance over successive songs. So, like, the crowd coming with you, or potentially you needing to win them over…it’s a sense of momentum and pacing. So what we wanted to do with this is capture the sense of a gig and use it for narrative means, for new gameplay and emotional experiences within the Rock Band framework.” Essentially, Gigs operate similar to older games’ Setlists, or Rock Band 3’s Challenges. “It’s a series of songs subdivided into a series of sets with set breaks,” said Foster. A Gig we played involved four songs in two sets of two. A set break between each duo had stuff we’ve never seen in Rock Band before. “If you’re the vocalist, you’re able to perform a sort of stage patter…it’s sort of like adding some LARPing to your Rock Band experience,” Foster said. “You’re sort of role-playing a different event that is sort of happening offstage, or got you to the show in the first place inside the campaign, we’re using them to deliver the narrative experience.” So what does that mean, gameplay-wise? “They need to be really fun to play,” Foster said. “Particularly as the crowd is reacting. So, you’ll do your crowd work as a vocalist, the band will play a couple of songs, and then you’ll take another break. And in those breaks, you’ll be able to do a lot of voting. In some cases, there’ll be a set list that is predefined, like in previous Rock Bands. But in other cases, you’ll – as a band – be able to vote on a setlist.” Choices appear between sets, drawn from your music library and the gig’s theme/genre. Bandmates have a limited time to choose the song they all wish to play -- which could lead to interesting, awkward interactions with you band. Your guitarist may decide on a spectacular, fun song the vocalist doesn’t know, or can’t sing to properly. An exhausted drummer can vote for something laid-back, while the rest of his bandmates troll her with a gnarly drum solo track. “It becomes a really interesting collaborative and competitive experience, as you’ll have people say what they want and what they absolutely don’t want,” Foster said. “It’s fun, because when you’re beat-matching, it’s tunnel vision; you’re focused on your instrument, you’re barely aware of other people if they’re falling out or if you can save them. But the moments between songs, we’re able to come up with these other game experiences, and they can be really fun.” Fighting or messing with your band isn’t necessarily to your advantage of course. You can carry over your multipliers and Overdrive power between songs during gigs, adding a small but interesting extra layer of strategy that can affect your band’s score. Gigs can be played for kicks in a party setting, for sure, but they’re also core to Rock Band 4’s campaign -- which involves an interesting branching narrative similar to an RPG. We’ll have more on that for you later this month.

    "LabBody": "By April 15, 2015. Let’s just get this out of the way: Mortal Kombat X is the best Mortal Kombat, period. It’s deeper, mechanically richer, and more fully featured than any of the nine games before it, hands down. On top of that, developer NetherRealm Studios has taken a bunch of risks by adding eight entirely new characters to the MK roster, while introducing fun, distinct variations to returning ones. Each of these risks pays off to varying degrees, but they also serve to highlight some of the ways in which the franchise is stuck in the past. Mortal Kombat X is an excellent fighter, and the most fun I’ve ever had with a Mortal Kombat game. The first thing MKX does to make itself feel new and exciting to both old series fans and casual fighters is a major roster shakeup. Before DLC ever enters the picture, MKX sports a respectable 24 fighters, and a whopping one third of those are honest-to-goodness new characters; not palette swaps or tweaked alternate versions of existing ones. Few fighting games with such a deep vault of fan-favorite characters have cleaned house so completely, and MKX is so much the better for it. Sure, I go way back with guys like Kabal and Smoke, but fresh faces like Takeda and Kung Jin bring so much novelty to the table gameplay-wise that it’s hard to be sad about their absence. Takeda is the most eye-catching new design, and he exemplifies what MKX does right with its new characters. He fights like you’d imagine a 21st-century ninja might, with an interesting mix of traditional weaponry and high-tech gadgetry. He’s got remote-controlled laser swords he can plant and recall at will, explosive kunai throwing knives, and arm-mounted, retractable grappling hooks that can open up into imposing blade-covered whips. He wields it all with a confident martial arts swagger that makes it all seem somehow plausible. In fact, everyone conveys their fighting style more effectively than in NetherRealms’ prior games thanks to the much-improved animations. Injustice was a step in the right direction of addressing the shortcomings of 2011’s Mortal Kombat , but MKX gets the rest of the way there: dash and hit animations no longer look like hapless flailing, for instance. Little details like this used to distract me from the fighting all the time, and I’m glad to see them finally ironed out. This helps MKX feel like the smoothest-playing Mortal Kombat ever. Walk speeds are snappier, pokes feel more useful, and with the awesome new variation system, there’s more to explore, discover, and exploit than ever before. Liu Kang has a variation where he can switch on the fly between healing and damaging stances, new grappler Torr employs an assist character to double-team opponents, Kotal Khan can place totems to grant himself temporary buffs – this is the kind of stuff you see in Persona 4 or BlazBlue, and seeing NetherRealms open up so many fun new doors is really refreshing. One mild distraction from the excellent combat though, is the visual inconsistency between characters. Some fighters, like Scorpion or newcomer D’vorah, look excellent, with tons of little details in their faces and costumes. Others, like Sonya and Jacqui, look far less detailed, with comparatively plain facial textures. It stands out because of the high peaks MKX hits during its best moments. With two of the better-looking fighters duking it out against one of the many beautiful backgrounds, it’s one of the best-looking console games around, so it sticks out when everything isn’t up to the same high quality level. The inconsistency that sticks out the most for me though, is the content of MKX’s so-so story mode, and how completely at odds it is with the aesthetic Mortal Kombat has built over the years. Again, NetherRealms has created something substantial for folks who like having a single-player experience, but it’s far less successful than previous attempts.

Yes, of course, Mortal Kombat is ostensibly “about” Fatalities, and they’re gorier and more satisfying here than ever, but MKX’s story mode also wants to be about characters with deep ties to one another: fathers and sons, estranged lovers, budding romance, and long-standing blood-feuds finally laid to rest. Adding all of that drama to a series that began as a thrown-together story of a bunch of loners fighting to their deaths for their own reasons in strange, dangerous-feeling places leaves MKX feeling a bit confused in that regard.

    "DiffbotBody": "The most rich and concentrated scriptural data that we have about the condition of the early Christian church after Christ suggests not vigor, optimism and promise but with problems and the need to endure to the end. The earliest Christian movement probably had no settled headquarters; the apostles were always on the move. If it had, though, communications from headquarters would have been at best occasional and slow. Moreover, local leaders lacked a “general handbook of instructions.” Almost none of the members had access to any scriptures; the New Testament didn’t even exist yet. And anyway, most were probably illiterate. They mostly relied upon memories of what some missionary had taught them while passing through. No general authority photographs appeared on their walls or in their magazines; when some visitor claimed to be an apostle, they had to determine whether he really was and which directives and teachings were authentically apostolic. In many ways, it’s a miracle that Christianity survived at all. But how were the early branches actually doing in those first generations after Jesus? The messages sent by the apostle John to “the seven churches of Asia” — “Asia,” here, refers to what is today western Turkey — offer an interesting window onto how things stood near the end of the first century A.D. (They’re recorded in Revelation 2-3.) According to Revelation 2:1-7, the Lord praised the branch in Ephesus because “thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars.” He commended them for their “works,” their “labour,” their “patience” and their unwillingness to tolerate evil. Nevertheless, he said, “thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy first works.” Unless they repent, he says, they’ll be “removed.” The Christians in Smyrna, the modern city of Izmir, are promised blessings only for the life to come. In the meantime, they’ll “suffer.” Some will be imprisoned and endure “tribulation.” But if they’re “faithful unto death,” they’ll receive “a crown of life” and escape “the second death” (see Revelation 2:10-11). Members of the church in Pergamos are praised for their steadfastness, but there is false doctrine and immorality among them and they’re commanded to repent. If they do, they’ll be blessed — in the next life (Revelation 2:12-17). The branch in Thyatira is praised for its charity, service and faith and, simultaneously, condemned for harboring gross immoralty. If the saints there “hold fast” until “the end,” though, they’ll reap glorious blessings in heaven (see Revelation 2:25-27). The Christian community at Sardis is addressed in Revelation 3:1-6. They seem to be alive, says the Lord, but they’re “dead.” “Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.” If they don’t repent, says the Lord, he’ll come upon them for judgment like a “thief,” at an hour they don’t expect. “Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white,” he says, plainly referring not to this life but to the next. “Thou hast a little strength,” says the Lord to the church members in ancient Philadelphia, and someday those who’ve opposed the faithful there will “know that I have loved thee.” But this won’t happen soon. Rather, the prophecy will be fulfilled in the last days, when the New Jerusalem has been established (Revelation 3:7-13). Finally, the Saints of Laodicea are told that because they’re “neither hot nor cold” in their discipleship but “lukewarm,” the Lord will spit them out of his mouth. (The reference is to the ancient city’s notoriously tepid and unpalatable water supply.) They’re arrogant because of their wealth, not realizing their spiritual poverty, their nakedness and blindness. Nevertheless, “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne” (see Revelation 3:14-22). Asia Minor, where these communities were located, had been a fertile field for significant early missionaries such as the apostle Paul, and it eventually became a powerful Christian stronghold. In subsequent centuries, for example, all of the seven great Christian “ecumenical councils” (beginning with Nicea in A.D. 325) were convened by Christian emperors in this region. By contrast, the ancient Latin West (including Rome) was a relative backwater. Yet these messages to the very early Christian communities of Roman Asia offer no optimistic promises of coming popularity and worldly triumph. Instead, they warn against heresy, immorality and fading devotion. The rewards promised to those who remain faithful are for the next life, following tribulations, suffering, imprisonment and death. The apostasy, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints understand it, was already underway.

    "DiffbotBody": "When wide receiver Jermaine Kearse hauled in the 35-yard pass from Russell Wilson for the game-winning overtime touchdown in the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, he was clearly pent up with a plethora of emotions. In what had to have been a cathartic moment, Kearse chucked the football into the stands, and the celebration for the Seattle Seahawks’ second-straight trip to the Super Bowl was officially underway. However, immediately after launching that ball into the ether, Kearse was filled with regret. He had given away a piece of Seahawks history. This was a bad decision on his part. Fortunately for Kearse and the Seahawks organization, it looks like that ball is going to be returned to the receiver who made the big play. Seattle fan Scott Shelton, rather than take the $20k offered to him by a sports memorabilia dealer, is giving the ball back to its rightful owner. Now, that’s the move of a true fan. Kearse plans on compensating Shelton for his gesture, but still that’s a lot of money to turn down. But, in the world of sports, history means money. And that price, albeit high, doesn’t even come close to the amount of money received for some of the bigger ticket items. 7. Babe Ruth’s bat Price sold for: $1,265,000 Babe Ruth hit a lot of home runs during his career as a major league ballplayer — 714, in fact. However, there is always something special about a first. It’s where the journey begins. And for Ruth, joining the New York Yankees was just another step toward greatness. So, when he crushed his first home run at Yankee Stadium, it meant something. This was the bat used to hit that ball. And thus, ‘The House That Ruth Built” was christened. 6. Paul Henderson’s ’72 Summit Series jersey Price sold for: $1,275,707 In 1972, the Canadian hockey team took on the Soviet Union in an eight-game series known as The Summit Series. During this power-house matchup, Paul Henderson scored three game-winning goals for team Canada, and, therefore, cemented his legendary status. People will be huge money to be a part of history. And Henderson’s performance was certainly historical. 5. Sheffield F.C. rulebook Price sold for: $1, 400,000 Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Therefore, it’s no surprise that the first pamphlet depicting the rules of the game would sell for so much. Handwritten in 1857, this piece is believed to be the oldest rulebook in history. And it belonged to the first-ever professional club, Sheffield F.C. Many of the rules in the notebook are still used in the sport today. 4. Honus Wagner baseball card Price sold for: $2,800,000 The most expensive baseball card of all-time does not feature a player many would think. Rather, the face on the card belongs to Honus Wagner. Considered to be the the holy grail of baseball cards, the reason it’s valued so high is because there were only a limited number ever printed. The card that sold for this high amount of money was very rare, and in great condition. 3. Mark McGwire’s 70th home run ball Price sold for: $3,000,000 Although the long balls of this former home run champ are now considered tainted, it doesn’t mean they weren’t valued at the time. Mark McGwire crushed 70 home runs in 1998, and his final one sold for quite a pretty penny. Sports fanatic Todd McFarlane was more than willing to fork over $3 million for this prized possession. At this number, it’s safe to say that McGwire’s home run ball is in a league of its own. 2. James Naismith’s founding rules of basketball Price sold for: $4,338,500 The popularity of the sport of basketball is undeniable. Not to mention, the stars who play this game are some of the most recognizable athletes on the planet. However, without proper rules, there would be no game. Which is why the father of basketball, James Naismith, wrote them down in 1891. These founding documents are among the most important pieces of sports history. Although it would seem that the birth certificate of basketball would be priceless, it appears that was not the case. All it took was a little over $4 million. 1. Babe Ruth Jersey Price sold for: $4,415,658 Babe Ruth, the Great Bambino, is baseball. He is probably the best the sport has ever seen — and will ever see. So it makes perfect sense that something belonging to this icon would sell for the most amount of money. The article of clothing that tops this list: Ruth’s jersey from 1920. This jersey is thought to be the oldest known Babe Ruth Yankee jersey in existence. There is simply nothing else like this out there. Once again, the Babe makes history.

    "LabBody": "Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images. When wide receiver Jermaine Kearse hauled in the 35-yard pass from Russell Wilson for the game-winning overtime touchdown in the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, he was clearly pent up with a plethora of emotions. In what had to have been a cathartic moment, Kearse chucked the football into the stands, and the celebration for the Seattle Seahawks’ second-straight trip to the Super Bowl was officially underway. However, immediately after launching that ball into the ether, Kearse was filled with regret. He had given away a piece of Seahawks history. This was a bad decision on his part. Fortunately for Kearse and the Seahawks organization, it looks like that ball is going to be returned to the receiver who made the big play. Seattle fan Scott Shelton, rather than take the $20k offered to him by a sports memorabilia dealer, is giving the ball back to its rightful owner. Now, that’s the move of a true fan. Kearse plans on compensating Shelton for his gesture, but still that’s a lot of money to turn down. But, in the world of sports, history means money. And that price, albeit high, doesn’t even come close to the amount of money received for some of the bigger ticket items.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Southwest Airlines' controversial CEO Gary Kelly appears to have opened a huge hornets' nest in the wake of news about a tentative agreement on a new contract with more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants who work at the low-fare behemoth. With Southwest's largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, Chicago also is the domicile for the largest number of Southwest flight attendants, more than 1,800 altogether, according to a spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents Southwest flight attendants. Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Another flight attendant with more than a decade of work at Southwest offered a similar sentiment in an email: \"The (Local 556) union does appear to be too cozy with management.\" Though so-called \"educators\" have been used by Local 556 in the past to help members sort through and understand details of proposed contracts, some flight attendants questioned that procedure this time around, suggesting it could be another means of influencing— or pressuring — union members to vote in favor of a new contract. Noted one Southwest flight attendant: \"Our union handpicked 100 people to fly into Dallas for 'tentative agreement' training with our union dollars for two days so they could 'educate' the rest of us on the tentative agreement.\" Some flight attendants also wondered why Southwest management was suddenly able to come to tentative terms with flight attendants, while other major unions, including those representing pilots, ramp agents and mechanics, have been unable to get even a tentative deal. Ramp agents, in particular, have been in talks for some four years. Flight attendant contract negotiations had been ongoing for two years. The rank and file members of Local 556 will be able to get their first look at the full contract starting tomorrow. Then they will have 16 days to obtain the proposed contract, read it, digest it and then vote — a shorter time frame than the 30-day window for previous contracts, according to some flight attendants who wonder why this is all suddenly so rushed. A Local 556 spokesman said the contract would be ratified if a majority of those who actually vote cast a vote in favor of ratification. As for the vocal backlash among some rank and file union members to news of the tentative contract, a Local 556 spokesman noted: \"We are a large group and not everyone is going to see things the same way.\" By the end of July, however, it should be clear whether enough flight attendants see the proposed contract the same way Southwest Airlines management and Local 556's executive board apparently do.",

    "DiffbotBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J. She began working for museums in earnest in 2002 when she became administrator of the Readington museums, where she oversaw three 18th-century buildings depicting Colonial life in New Jersey farming communities. Hollander helped with several restoration efforts and spent a great deal of her time making history accessible to the public. She developed Hands-on History programs centered on themes such as health and hygiene in the Colonial era and traditional crafts such as barrel-making. She would also take on the persona of Vrouw Maritje Bouman, a 36-year-old mother of five in the Colonial era. Donning a white bonnet, embroidered apron and red linen bedjacket, Hollander would tell school groups what life was like in 1755 as she performed daily chores. \"I would show them that I was cooking on a hearth and ask them if they help their moms cook on a hearth,\" she recalled. \"They would say we don't have a hearth. We have a stove. I would ask them what is it? How did it get hot? Wood? Most didn't know, but by asking them questions, if forced them to think about their world.\" Hollander played the part so seriously that a student once stopped her on the street to tell her she looked just like Vrouw Bouman and ask if she was her descendant. \"She got the kids to appreciate history,\" said Margaret Smith, program director at Readington. Hollander kept their attention, she said, through hands-on activities and stories. Hollander left Readington in 2010 when the board made her job part-time and soon after started working at Clinton's Red Mill Village. With 40,000 artifacts and a 10-acre campus along the scenic south branch of the Raritan River, the mill is well suited for exhibits and special events. Hollander tapped that potential, hosting Civil War Days and Revolutionary Days, weekend festivals that featured re-enactors. She also got a quick lesson in crisis management there. The Halloween before she was hired, the nonprofit that runs the mill had transformed the historic spot to the Asylum of Terror, haunted by \"wretched souls\" tormented by \"dementia, paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviors, physical abnormalities and deformities.\" The theme drew criticism from the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma and prompted the National Alliance on Mental Illness to alert the public about the Clinton mill. Mill officials approved a safer \"zombie\" theme the year Hollander came on board and issued a public apology in the newspaper. The board would have left it at that had it not been for Hollander, said Pat Bower, a former mill board member. Hollander reached out to the alliance and the council, creating a history exhibit on how the state had treated the mentally ill. \"She used it as an opportunity to highlight the issue and engage public discussion,\" Bower said. Hollander said some didn't want the exhibit to include the state's mistreatment of the mentally ill and the prejudices held against people with mental illness. But Hollander was insistent that a full story be told, and that the mill was the right place to tell it. \"You can't learn to do things right if you don't recognize the things that happened in the past,\" she said. Hollander left Clinton three years ago for a job as assistant director of communications and outreach at the New Jersey regional office at American Jewish Committee, an advocacy nonprofit. There, she said, she learned about building connections with people and partnerships to advance a cause. Considering just a third of the National Museum of Industrial History's budget will be covered by museum tickets, she said building partnerships — in the form of sponsors, grants and memberships — will be key. She also learned at AJC that history is more significant to people if you can show its impact on people today. She believes she can do that at the National Museum of Industrial History by showing how the machines and innovations that built America continue to have an impact on the world. And here, she'll also have an opportunity to develop programs that inspire the next generation. \"That's where the truly, truly open minds are,\" Hollander said. \"To them, the sky's the limit, anything can happen.\" It takes, she said, just one historical figure, artifact or idea to inspire a future. Just as Grover's Mill did for her.

She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J.",

I would like to start by saying I have been a school custodian for more than 26 years making schools clean and safe for all staff and students. First of all, the floor strippers are of low odor and should not be able to be smelled out on the street let alone by those driving by in a vehicle. Second, the products are water soluble and actually mix with water to work. Third, it is not uncommon for flooring kept up with proper care to last for 20-plus years. I think that’s cost effective.

Mechling Rohnert Park Here’s the problem Editor: I get it: The lure and seduction of wine as a current and potentially harmful phenomena. This is a beautiful place to live and thrive, to grow and to welcome visitors. Yet, there’s the significant question of excessiveness with just too much in order to withstand the impact upon water, use of pesticides and events with increased traffic. In jeopardy is the stability of local agriculture (livestock, produce, grape growers and wineries) to describe the standards of living for local purveyors. While economic development may encourage healthy lifestyles, the current answer reveals mere trends with little consideration toward maintaining a quality of life which truly stabilizes the why in the first place. Soon, the initial attractions will no longer have their attractive place in time. What’s then left is a vacancy unable to reconstruct; just too expensive and inaccessible. The “service” sector will not exist, nor then will the schools, neighborhoods, businesses, security, history, culture and diversity. The danger is an unhealthy environment. Literally. Barbara Harris Sebastopol A better solution Editor: Bill O’Reilly of Fox News is advocating Kate’s Law in response to the recent horrific circumstances resulting in Kate Steinle’s murder in San Francsico. His proposal would mandate five-year prison sentences for first-time illegal felons, 10 years for second-time offenders and 20 years for third-time offenders. This would obligate the American taxpayer to provide total housing, food, medical care and basic needs to an unconscionable increase in the already impacted prison population we have. Might a better solution be to recognize our neighbor country Mexico and direct funds and assistance that are presently going to distant countries with little appreciative benefit and recognition. If we were to partner with the leadership in Mexico, they may be able to improve their economy, incarcerate their own citizens, protect the borders and offer homeland opportunities to their citizens. Thus, the illegal immigration may become less attractive or deemed necessary and be beneficial to each of our countries. Shirley Walker Petaluma How about higher? Editor: “Raise the smoking age to 21” (Editorial, Thursday.) Even better, raise it to 80. Gary Anderson Santa Rosa Not made for this Editor: Gov. Jerry Brown’s audacious prison plan, called “realignment,” began in October 2011. Numerous reports have shown increased crime since the plan took effect. Proponents of realignment have dismissed those reports as being “too early to tell.” Thursday’s paper contained two reports on the subject of “realignment.” A story on page B3 stated that after decades of declines, Los Angeles is experiencing a 13 percent rise in crime. Page B5 showed that currently 54 percent of felons are back behind prison walls within three years compared to 67.5 percent in 2011. Is it still too early to tell? Regardless of one’s political leanings, what is clear is that county jails, which were designed to house inmates for one year or less, are now used to house felons for multiple years. Fifteen-year sentences to serve time inside a county jail is not unheard of anymore. To be sure, some money comes from the state to fund the increased burden counties incurred as a result of realignment. The rest comes from the county’s general budget. Isn’t it ironic that the response to inadequate health care in state prisons is to force counties to shoulder the burden? As Los Angeles is discovering, the costs forced upon local government are more than fiscal. Dale C. Miller Owner, Romelli Bail Bonds Santa Rosa Stand firm Editor: San Francisco must not be dissuaded from maintaining its sanctuary movement to protect undocumented immigrants from cruel and unusual treatment thru the inhumane deportation process. Granted one person, one very undesirable person, fell thru the cracks and murdered a special young woman. That occurrence was not the fault of the city and county of San Francisco. What about the murderer’s country of origin? Why did his country allow him free to leave his country? It seems that much better communication between agencies of the U.S. with the agencies of other countries needs to happen. But, San Francisco must maintain its practice of protecting undocumented immigrants. Cassandra Lista Santa Rosa",

    "DiffbotBody": "It has been a wild afternoon in the NHL as the Bruins picked up the 13th pick for Milan Lucic after they earlier traded Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for the 15th pick as well as a couple of second round selections. They owned the 14th pick heading into the draft and the rumor is that they are interested in defenseman Noah Hanifan and could trade up with their multiple picks. Earlier, the Senators dealt goaltender Robin Lehner and forward David Legwand to Buffalo for the 21st overall selection. Expect a lot more trading to go on in the first round. Don’t forget, for everything NHL, check out Rotoworld's Player News, and follow @Rotoworld_ HK and @mfinewaxhockey on Twitter. 1. Edmonton Oilers - Connor McDavid (C) Erie Connor McDavid is a once-in-a-generational talent who blends together the best skills of Hockey Hall of Famers at warp speed. He is blessed a 6’1, 190-pound frame, great character and an awesome array of moves that produced 169 points in just 67 games through the OHL regular season and playoffs. He is the catalyst for positive plays on every inch of the ice due to lightning-quick decision-making, a powerful stride, brilliant puck skills and his intuitive ability to find the open man or take his shot — no matter the quality or quantity of the defense he is facing. The Newmarket, Ontario-native appears to have the capacity to produce at over a point-per-game pace as a rookie and put together the type of career that ranks amongst the best of all time. His star power to the sport compares to what LeBron James brought to the NBA in 2003 and Andrew Luck brought to the NFL in 2012. 2. Buffalo Sabres - Jack Eichel (C) Boston University Jack Eichel is the best consolation prize since the Pittsburgh Penguins snagged Evgeni Malkin second overall in the 2004 NHL Draft after Alex Ovechkin. The Chelmsford, Massachusetts-native has the size, speed and skill to single-handedly take the game up a notch every time he steps onto the ice. Coming off the most dominating NCAA season for a freshman since Paul Kariya in 1993, Eichel led Boston University to a conference title, led the nation in scoring with 71 points in 40 games and earned the Hobey Baker Award as the league’s best player. Highlighting Eichel’s deep collection of skills are his superior hockey IQ, his heavy shot, relentless work ethic and capable defensive prowess. The 18-year-old comes with all the trimmings of a franchise center and it's highly likely that we'll see him in the NHL next year. 3. Arizona Coyotes - Dylan Strome (C) Erie Otters Strome was the OHL’s leading scorer (129 points in 68 games) and boasts a robust 6’3, 187-pound frame that has number-one NHL center potential written all over it. Strome thrives with the puck in open-ice and can find his teammates with his 360-degree vision, or finish off the play with his quick, accurate shot. While Connor McDavid was sidelined, Strome had a golden opportunity to prove he was not the byproduct of the projected superstar’s brilliance in Erie, and succeeded with 18 goals and 35 points in 21 games. Strome’s points-per-game dipped from two to 1.67 without McDavid, although for the most part the duo only played together on the power play anyways. Strome’s acceleration is a work in progress, as are his defensive game and physicality. Although there is room for fine-tuning, the Missiauga, Ontario-native’s strength, puckhandling skills and creativity have spurred comparisons to some of the best centers in the game. 4. Toronto Maple Leafs - Mitchell Marner (C) London Knights Marner stands out as an impact player in all three zones of the rink — and it’s not because of his frame. At 5’11, 163-pounds, Marner is a lightweight with a heavy dose of electrifying offensive talent that belongs in the top-five of any draft class, including this year’s special crop. With 123 points in 63 games for the London Knights this year, Marner proved to be a tremendously talented force with elite speed, vision, hockey sense, a finishing touch and the ability to make people around him better. He overcomes his lack of size with outstanding elusiveness and deceptiveness with the puck, and answers the call in his own zone and on the penalty kill. Marner needs to get bulkier and stronger, but he has the potential to become a top forward. He's probably not going to play for Toronto next season, but he's a cornerstone of the franchise's rebuild. 5. Carolina Hurricanes - Noah Hanifin (D) Boston College With a wide arsenal of NHL-ready skills, the two attributes that push Noah Hanifin on top of the pack are his size and skating abilities. At 6’2, 203 pounds, the Norwood, Massachusetts-native plays with tremendous composure and finished just five points shy of Boston College’s team scoring race as a 17-year-old (23 points in 37 games). Hanifin excels at rushing up the ice and distributing the puck, but he understands good offense also means good defense. As a result, his transition to the defensive game is exceptional, and as a rookie, he was relied upon for edgy play in his own zone. Hanifin projects to be a top-pairing NHL defenseman because he can dictate the play offensively, absorb and adapt to the game defensively and he rarely makes mistakes. He'll get every opportunity to make the big club out of training camp. 6. New Jersey Devils - Pavel Zacha (C) Sarnia A challenging, inconsistent and injury-shortened rookie season in the OHL was not enough to drown out Zacha’s irresistible blend of size, speed and skill. The 6’3, 214 pounder may be a wild card due to his underwhelming results with Sarnia (34 points in 37 games) highlighting the Czech’s slow transition to North American style hockey. But with tender mitts and overwhelming grit, many scouts see this as a hurdle rather than a roadblock. Zacha’s dynamic stickhandling, blazing foot speed and booming shot parallel the tools of a top-line NHL scorer. His competitive drive is exceptional. He wants to be a difference maker and play physical, but those factors resulted in him taking two suspensions last season totaling eight games. Zacha has an abundance of raw skills and thus, massive potential. But the 18-year-old has a lot to prove and overcome before earning an NHL roster spot. 7. Philadelphia Flyers - Ivan Provorov (D) Brandon There are scouts who allege that Ivan Provorov is the best defenseman of the 2015 NHL Draft class, and the six-foot, 201-pounder certainly makes a case. Though he’s not as big or as fluid a skater as Noah Hanifan, Provorov’s strength, offensive talent and defensive ferocity have spurred comparisons to Duncan Keith and Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Playing on the top pairing for the WHL’s most dominant team, Provorov notched 61 points in 60 games with the Brandon Wheat Kings and took charge of the power play and penalty kill. He’s quick, intelligent, poised under pressure and commonly leads to impact physical plays. Provorov’s adeptness on the rush, at the point and battling in his own zone should lead to him having a long NHL career. Their Flyers' defense has been an ongoing issue for years and while they have made strides towards addressing that, Provorov is a big boost in that regard. 8. Columbus Blue Jackets - Zach Werenski (D) Michigan Much like Connor McDavid overshadowed Jack Eichel, Zach Werenski has the tools to be a top-pairing defenseman in the NHL, but has been overshadowed by fellow American Noah Hanifin. Werenski joined the Michigan Wolverines as a 17-year-old and played big-time minutes. The 6’2, 214 pounder proved to be an intelligent game manager through his skating mobility and poise with the puck. Werenski is aggressive on the forecheck, which can sometimes lead to him overextending himself and forcing plays. But he didn’t look out of place on the American blueline at the World Juniors, and notched 25 points in 35 games for the Wolverines as the youngest player in the NCAA. Werenski has some attributes he needs to refine such as amping up his physicality, but he possesses the raw skill and compete level to be a top-flight NHL defenseman. 9. San Jose Sharks - Timo Meier (RW) Halifax Meier is one of the more NHL-ready players from this year’s draft class and has the ability to step right into game action with his 6’1\", 209-pound body. He played for the Halifax Mooseheads of the QMJHL for the last two seasons and finished second on the team with 90 points (44 goals) in just 61 games last season. He also produced a franchise-record 23 power-play goals in 2014-2015. Meier can be a dominant winger and also play center to add versatility. He is a very bright player and is aware of game situations both in the offensive and defensive zone. The Swiss-born power forward was the highest-ranked player from the QMJHL and is particularly notable for his impeccable passes through traffic and hard, accurate shots on goal. He is the type of player you want on your team with his ability to create offense with his plethora of skill or shut down an opponent’s top line. 10. Colorado Avalanche - Mikko Rantanen (RW) TPS Turku (Finland) Rantanen is an enticing package of size, intelligence, and skill who is always a threat to score while on the ice. The 18-year-old Finnish prospect skated for TPS Turku of the Finnish Elite League last season where he registered nine goals and 19 assists in 56 games. He is an exceptional playmaker and speedy skater but he doesn’t play a physical game despite his 6’4\" frame. He rose to the number one ranked International skater in the Central Scouting final ranking prior to this year’s Draft. His style of play should fit in the NHL as he can protect the puck well and is difficult to check due to his size. In Rantanen, Colorado is getting a prospect that compares favorably to Ryan Getzlaf and Mikko Koivu in terms of upside. continue story » 11. Florida Panthers - Lawson Crouse (LW) Kingston At 6’4, 210 pounds, Crouse is amongst the biggest players in this draft and one of the most powerful. Though his 29-goal, 51-point output in 56 OHL games this season were below production standards for a top-10 forward pick, Crouse consistently made an impact by using his size, strength, positioning and puck skills. During the World Juniors, the London, Ontario-native proved to be a versatile two-way force, succeeding in his shutdown, bottom-six energy role with tournament champions. Crouse's prominence in the offensive zone is evident by his consistent ability to win physical battles, shield the puck, screen goaltenders and bury loose pucks. His NHL potential lies somewhere between a physical force on a top scoring line and a checking third-liner with offensive upside. 12. Dallas Stars - Denis Gurianov (RW) Lada Togliatti (Russia) Gurianov is the prototypical Russian winger. He has great size, speed and skill and he has produced solid offensive numbers throughout his young career. The 6’2, 192 pounder had one assist in eight games with Lada Togliatti in the KHL, but had a fantastic season with the club’s junior team in the MHL where he posted 15 goals and 25 points in 23 games. The risk with Guryanov doesn’t necessarily appear on the ice. Like any Russian who’s attached to a KHL team, there’s always a risk that the player’s arrival in North America may be delayed or worse, he may never show up. If Gurianov is willing to come to North America, he has the potential to be the steal of the 2015 Entry Draft. The Stars better hope so as they took a huge chance picking him at number 12. 13. Boston Bruins (via Los Angeles) - Jakub Zboril (D) Saint John The Bruins acquired the 13th overall pick from Los Angeles as part of the Milan Lucic trade. Zboril could be this year’s home run draft pick as he has the potential to be the complete package. He is one of the smarter players in the draft class and does all the little things right. The 6’2\" Czech-born defenseman is not afraid to get nasty and has no problem defending his teammates as evident by his 73 penalty minutes in 44 games with the Saint John Sea Dogs in the QMJHL last season. But don’t let that paint the full picture of who Zboril is as he tallied 13 goals, which is a franchise record for a rookie defenseman, and 33 points with a plus-two rating last season. The smooth skating defenseman has a never-ending motor, plays with poise and confidence and can even be a potential quarterback to power plays. Zboril’s biggest asset may be his positional play as he is very sound in all three areas of the ice. 14. Boston Bruins - Jake DeBrusk (LW) Swift Current What DeBrusk lacks in size, he makes up for with hard work and the will to battle in the dirty areas on the ice. The 5’11,\" 170-pound left winger has a knack for scoring and finding open ice in the offensive zone. DeBrusk is a natural sniper who has exceptional creativity and individual skill with his greatest strength being his compete level. Even though the 18-year-old, Edmonton-born forward doesn’t play a physical game, he will out work his opponents and is able to put up some big time scoring numbers as evident by his team-leading 42 goals and 81 points scored for the Swift Current Broncos in 72 WHL games last season. The son of former NHL player, Louie DeBrusk, he can create havoc on the forecheck and force defenders into making poor, rushed decisions that lead to goals for DeBrusk. He is an ultra-competitive, two-way forward who could eventually turn into a Zach Parise-type player down the line for the Bruins. 15. Boston Bruins (from Calgary) - Zachary Senyshyn (RW) Sault Ste. Marie Boston surprised many by selecting the 42nd-rated Senyshyn, who is a big, skilled winger with good hands and skating ability. The 6’2, 195 pounder spent his first full junior season with the OHL’s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 2014-15, where he scored 26 goals and 45 points in 66 games. Those numbers may not stand out compared to other offensive-minded players in this draft class, but when you consider that Senyshyn played mostly in a bottom-six role on a stacked Greyhounds team, his production appears to be more than reasonable. The native of Ottawa, Ontario will surely need more time in the junior ranks, but we should see a sizeable spike in his OHL numbers next season. He appears to have all the tools to develop into a top-six winger at the NHL level, but it won't be this season. 16. New York Islanders (from Edmonton via Pittsburgh) - Mathew Barzal (C) Seattle For Barzal, one of his greatest strengths is his lack of glaring weaknesses. As a playmaking center that is quick, smart with the puck and superb on defense, the six-foot, 183-pound Vancouver-native is an elite prospect despite missing 41 games to injury over the past two seasons. The small sample size hasn’t scared anyone off in predicting big things from Barzal, who has put up 107 points in 103 WHL games. Of the 57 points he scored in 2014-15, 45 were assists and 26 of those were primary assists. Barzal is a pass-first speedster who can be a force on either side of special teams. Scouts admire the pivot’s hockey I.Q, and warn his slick wrist shot could be just as lethal as his ability to distribute the puck. The Islanders traded defenseman Griffin Reinhart to Edmonton to get the 16th and 33rd overall picks and in Barzal they have gotten someone with top-six potential. 17. Winnipeg Jets - Kyle Connor (C) Youngstown (USHL) The Jets have a great stable of prospects and were in a position to take the best player available. Connor is a gritty, two-way player who impresses with skating and quickness. He has played for the USHL's Youngstown Phantoms for the past three seasons and led all players with 80 points in 56 games last season. The 6'1\", 177-pound winger is more of a playmaker than goal scorer as he averaged nearly an assist per game over the last two seasons with Youngstown. Connor has also made a name for himself internationally as he won gold with Team USA at the 2014 Under-18 World Junior Championship. During that tournament, the Michigan native scored four goals and three assists and tied for the lead with a plus eight rating in seven games. He has the potential to develop into an effective top-six forward in the NHL, but patience will be needed as he's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2015-2016 season. 18. Ottawa Senators - Thomas Chabot (D) Saint John Chabot is a two-way defenseman with great size and excellent puck skills and mobility. The 6’2\", 180-pound left-hander needs to bulk up in order to make it to the big stage, but has the potential to flourish into a very reliable all-around defenseman in the NHL. He has moved up the draft class ranks very rapidly and has quickly drawn lots of scouts’ attention. Chabot led all QMJHL blueliners with 41 points (12 goals, 29 assists) in 66 games last season and was able to improve his plus minus from a minus-29 in 2013-2014 to a plus-6 last season. In the 2015 Under-18 World Juniors, the Quebec native tied for the team lead among defensemen with five points in seven games. Chabot will need some more seasoning before he will make an impact in the NHL. 19. Detroit Red Wings - Evgeni Svechnikov (LW) Cape Breton Svechnikov is an electric, confident winger who oozes with potential. His 6’2\", 200-pound frame allows him to be aggressive on the forecheck and get physically engaged. The 18-year-old Russian is an incredibly talented and skilled winger who possesses slick skating and a lethal, accurate shot. Svechnikov came over from Russia in 2014 and played the 2014-2015 season with Cape Breton in the QMJHL where he was the team’s third leading scorer as a rookie. He amassed 32 goals and 78 points with 70 penalty minutes and a plus-19 rating in 55 games. He has adapted well to playing in North America and has learned the basics of the English language in just over a year. Svechnikov could develop into a deadly offensive threat in the NHL, but he shouldn't be expected to play at that level any time soon, especially seeing as Detroit loves to give its prospects plenty of development time in the minors. 20. Minnesota Wild - Joel Eriksson Ek (C) Farestads (Sweden) Eriksson Ek is a player that moved up the draft boards very quickly over the past few months and finished the NHL Central Scouting’s final ranks as the fourth best skater among European players. He is a 6'2\", 180-pound centerman who has a lethal shot and can be an offensive catalyst in the NHL for years to come. He uses his size well in tight situations and is a true power forward who is not afraid to go to the net and corners. Eriksson Ek can create scoring chances by using his size, puckhandling skills, and skating ability. In the 2014-15 season, he split time with Farjestad in the Swedish Hockey League, where he scored four goals and two assists in 34 games, and their junior affiliate team, where he posted 21 goals and 32 points in 25 games. Eriksson Ek also represented Sweden at the Under-18 World Juniors and scored a team best five goals and six points. continue story » 21. Ottawa (from Buffalo via New York Islanders) - Colin White (C) NTDP (USA) White is a strong two-way center who plays the game at a high level and can be an effective player even when he doesn’t have the puck due to his superior skating skills. The 6’0\", 183-pound Massachusetts-born forward is highly regarded for making players around him better and his ability to play in both the offensive and defensive zones. White played for the U.S. Under-18 National team in 2014-2015 scoring 23 goals and 54 points in 54 games played. He also notched the gold medal-clinching goal in overtime to defeat Finland at the 2015 Under-18 World Junior Championships. During that tournament, he scored six goals and added three assists in seven games en route to the gold medal. He is committed to playing the 2015-2016 season at Boston College but he should be an impact NHL player down the road. 22. Washington Capitals - Ilya Samsonov (G) Magnitogorsk (Russia) Samsonov is one of the top goaltenders in the 2015 Draft. The young Russian is big (6’3, 200 lbs) and technically sound for such a young player. The 18-year-old made his KHL debut this season with Magnitogorsk, where he allowed two goals in 21 minutes of action. Samsonov spent most of the year in the Russian Junior league, so he will definitely need more seasoning and development before he makes an impact at the NHL level. Washington doesn't have any need to rush him given Braden Holtby and Philipp Grubauer's youth, but that being said Samsonov is reportedly locked into the KHL for another three seasons. That's an awfully long time to wait to gain control of a first round pick and makes this pick a very big gamble in our minds. 23. Vancouver Canucks - Brock Boeser (RW) Waterloo (USHL) Boeser has been compared by scouts to Patrick Sharp with his natural scoring ability and his accurate and quick shot release. He is a two-way power forward who is effective at finding open space on the ice and has the ability to create scoring chances off the rush by finding open teammates with his great vision and ability to read the play. The 6-foot, 195-pound, right winger has an excellent first step and is able to quickly start and stop on the dime creating separation among defenders. At the same time, scouts are looking for Boeser to improve his defensive zone coverage as well as his board play. He played for the Waterloo Black Hawks of the USHL in the 2014-15 season where he tied for the league lead in goals with 35 and finished third in points with 68 in 57 games. He is a complete player who has the potential to become an elite-level scorer in the NHL. 24. Philadelphia Flyers (from Toronto via Nashville) - Travis Konecny (C) Ottawa Konecny is an extremely talented winger who has the ability to play center and has the determination to do anything to win a game. The 5’10\", 172-pound forward has skated for the Ottawa 67’s of the OHL the past two seasons where he scored a combined 55 goals and 138 points in 123 games. He was drafted first overall in the 2013 OHL Priority Selection draft and named the OHL’s Rookie of the Year in the 2013-2014 season. Konecny possesses above average hockey IQ, ultra-quick stickhandling skills, and a knack for scoring with his quick shot release. Combine that with his ability to play in all three zones of the ice and his willingness to play physical when needed and you’re looking at a potential game changer. Konecny will need some further time to develop before he makes his mark in the NHL. This could be a steal for the Flyers at number 24 as Konecny was as high as 11th on some lists. 25. Winnipeg Jets (from Buffalo via St. Louis) - Jack Roslovic (C) NTDP (USA) Roslovic is a fierce competitor with incredible playmaking skills and has been known to be a pass-first type player. He is an explosive skater and uses his speed to create plays and get the puck into high traffic areas. At 6’0,\" 185 pounds, the centerman needs to bulk up a bit, but will have time to mature as he’s committed to Miami University of Ohio for 2015-2016. In 25 games with the U.S. National Under-18 Team last season, Roslovic scored 11 goals and 38 points playing on a line with 2016 highly touted prospects, Austin Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk. His stock has skyrocketed this season as he was ranked 52nd among Central Scoutings midseason North American Skater rankings and ended up climbing to the point where Winnipeg felt confident taking him with a late first round pick. He is, as is the norm with picks at this point, a project, but could turn into a really solid contributor in the NHL in a few years. 26. Montreal Canadiens - Noah Juulsen (D) Everett Going into the 2014-15 campaign, Juulsen had already shown that he was capable of playing a responsible defensive game, but he made great strides at the other end of the ice with nine goals and 52 points in 68 contests. The 6-foot-1, 175-pound defenseman still has a lot of growing to do with the puck though. For example, while he has demonstrated some offensive creativity, he'll be expected to show growth in that regard. He also needs to be smarter in that regard and quicker on the transition when he's carrying that puck. That being said, he's capable of being a leader on the ice and he's willing to play a gritty game. There's certainly enough there to make him worth keeping in the back of your mind even if he's likely at least a couple years away from being an NHL regular. 27. Anaheim Ducks - Jacob Larsson (D) Frolunda (Sweden) Larsson is a 6’2,\" 192 pound, lanky defensemen who models his game after his favorite player, Oliver Ekman-Larsson. The Swedish born lefty is a smooth, mobile skater who makes smart plays and sees the ice well. He is an all-around defenseman who has high-end potential if he is able to bulk up and fill in his frame. Larsson spent the majority of the 2014-15 season with Frolunda’s junior team where he recorded eight goals and 11 assists in 30 games. He also played in 20 games with Frolunda’s top team last season, scoring a goal and two assists. On the international stage, Larsson was able to tally three assists in five games for team Sweden at the 2014 Under-18 World Juniors. His could be a solid top-four defenseman in the NHL down the line once he fills out a bit. Larsson will need more seasoning before he makes an impact in the NHL. 28. New York Islanders (from Tampa Bay via NY Rangers) - Anthony Beauvillier (LW) Shawinigan In order to get the 28th selection, the Islanders sent the 33rd and 72nd overall picks to Tampa Bay. This is a well-traveled pick as it was originally the New York Rangers' and sent to the Lightning as part of the Martin St. Louis deal. At just 5’10\" and 175 pounds, Beauvillier is a slippery, tenacious, hard-working forward who possesses an impressive skill set and plays with a non-stop engine. He is an offensive scorer with above average puck-handling skills, hockey sense, and speed. Scouts have pointed out that he needs to work on his discipline and bulk up, but he is known for leading by example on the ice. He is a relentless forechecker and never quits on the play. The Quebec-native had 42 goals, 94 points, and 72 penalty minutes in 67 QMJHL games last season. He was also a very efficient centerman, leading the league in faceoff wins last season. 29. Columbus (from Toronto via Philadelphia and Tampa Bay) - Gabriel Carlsson (D) Linkopings (Sweden) Carlsson is a big body, who is extremely smart in his own zone, but unlike fellow countrymen Erik Karlsson and Oliver Ekman-Larsson, he doesn't have much offensive upside. The 6’4, 183 pound Swede played for Linkoping in the Swedish junior league where he registered no goals, seven assists and 14 penalty minutes in 39 games. He also represented Sweden at the Ivan Hlinka (U18) tournament, where he registered one assist in five games. Although his ceiling might not be very high, he is an intriguing prospect because scouts know exactly what to expect from him at the next level. If he's able to improve his play with the puck even a little bit, he should be able to develop into a shutdown defenseman on an NHL roster. 30. Arizona Coyotes (from Chicago) - Nick Merkley (RW) Kelowna Merkley is an undersized forward with elite playmaking skills who can also play center at 5’10\" and 187 pounds. He creates scoring chances as good as anyone in this year’s draft class and his work ethic is second to none. Merkley’s critics have said he is not the strongest skater, but due to his extremely high hockey IQ, he can be a valuable asset in the NHL similar to the way Tyler Johnson has become. Despite his small frame, he is still not afraid to do the dirty work by battling in front of the net and pick up scoring chances the hard way. He has spent the last three seasons with the WHL’s Kelowna Rockets and scored 90 points (20 goals and 70 assists) with 79 penalty minutes in 2014-2015. All-in-all, he is a player with high upside due to his exceptional puckhandling ability and decision making. Merkley could be a steal at number 30 as many experts had him ranked in the top 15.",
    "LabBody": "It has been a wild afternoon in the NHL as the Bruins picked up the 13th pick for Milan Lucic after they earlier traded Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for the 15th pick as well as a couple of second round selections. They owned the 14th pick heading into the draft and the rumor is that they are interested in defenseman Noah Hanifan and could trade up with their multiple picks. Earlier, the Senators dealt goaltender Robin Lehner and forward David Legwand to Buffalo for the 21st overall selection. Expect a lot more trading to go on in the first round. Don’t forget, for everything NHL, check out Rotoworld's Player News, and follow @Rotoworld_ HK and @mfinewaxhockey on Twitter. 1. Edmonton Oilers - Connor McDavid (C) Erie. Connor McDavid is a once-in-a-generational talent who blends together the best skills of Hockey Hall of Famers at warp speed. He is blessed a 6’1, 190-pound frame, great character and an awesome array of moves that produced 169 points in just 67 games through the OHL regular season and playoffs. He is the catalyst for positive plays on every inch of the ice due to lightning-quick decision-making, a powerful stride, brilliant puck skills and his intuitive ability to find the open man or take his shot — no matter the quality or quantity of the defense he is facing. The Newmarket, Ontario-native appears to have the capacity to produce at over a point-per-game pace as a rookie and put together the type of career that ranks amongst the best of all time. His star power to the sport compares to what LeBron James brought to the NBA in 2003 and Andrew Luck brought to the NFL in 2012. 2. Buffalo Sabres - Jack Eichel (C) Boston University. Jack Eichel is the best consolation prize since the Pittsburgh Penguins snagged Evgeni Malkin second overall in the 2004 NHL Draft after Alex Ovechkin. The Chelmsford, Massachusetts-native has the size, speed and skill to single-handedly take the game up a notch every time he steps onto the ice. Coming off the most dominating NCAA season for a freshman since Paul Kariya in 1993, Eichel led Boston University to a conference title, led the nation in scoring with 71 points in 40 games and earned the Hobey Baker Award as the league’s best player. Highlighting Eichel’s deep collection of skills are his superior hockey IQ, his heavy shot, relentless work ethic and capable defensive prowess. The 18-year-old comes with all the trimmings of a franchise center and it's highly likely that we'll see him in the NHL next year. 3. Arizona Coyotes - Dylan Strome (C) Erie Otters. Strome was the OHL’s leading scorer (129 points in 68 games) and boasts a robust 6’3, 187-pound frame that has number-one NHL center potential written all over it. Strome thrives with the puck in open-ice and can find his teammates with his 360-degree vision, or finish off the play with his quick, accurate shot. While Connor McDavid was sidelined, Strome had a golden opportunity to prove he was not the byproduct of the projected superstar’s brilliance in Erie, and succeeded with 18 goals and 35 points in 21 games. Strome’s points-per-game dipped from two to 1.67 without McDavid, although for the most part the duo only played together on the power play anyways. Strome’s acceleration is a work in progress, as are his defensive game and physicality. Although there is room for fine-tuning, the Missiauga, Ontario-native’s strength, puckhandling skills and creativity have spurred comparisons to some of the best centers in the game. 4. Toronto Maple Leafs - Mitchell Marner (C) London Knights. Marner stands out as an impact player in all three zones of the rink — and it’s not because of his frame. At 5’11, 163-pounds, Marner is a lightweight with a heavy dose of electrifying offensive talent that belongs in the top-five of any draft class, including this year’s special crop. With 123 points in 63 games for the London Knights this year, Marner proved to be a tremendously talented force with elite speed, vision, hockey sense, a finishing touch and the ability to make people around him better. He overcomes his lack of size with outstanding elusiveness and deceptiveness with the puck, and answers the call in his own zone and on the penalty kill. Marner needs to get bulkier and stronger, but he has the potential to become a top forward. He's probably not going to play for Toronto next season, but he's a cornerstone of the franchise's rebuild. 5. Carolina Hurricanes - Noah Hanifin (D) Boston College. With a wide arsenal of NHL-ready skills, the two attributes that push Noah Hanifin on top of the pack are his size and skating abilities. At 6’2, 203 pounds, the Norwood, Massachusetts-native plays with tremendous composure and finished just five points shy of Boston College’s team scoring race as a 17-year-old (23 points in 37 games). Hanifin excels at rushing up the ice and distributing the puck, but he understands good offense also means good defense. As a result, his transition to the defensive game is exceptional, and as a rookie, he was relied upon for edgy play in his own zone. Hanifin projects to be a top-pairing NHL defenseman because he can dictate the play offensively, absorb and adapt to the game defensively and he rarely makes mistakes. He'll get every opportunity to make the big club out of training camp. 6. New Jersey Devils - Pavel Zacha (C) Sarnia. A challenging, inconsistent and injury-shortened rookie season in the OHL was not enough to drown out Zacha’s irresistible blend of size, speed and skill. The 6’3, 214 pounder may be a wild card due to his underwhelming results with Sarnia (34 points in 37 games) highlighting the Czech’s slow transition to North American style hockey. But with tender mitts and overwhelming grit, many scouts see this as a hurdle rather than a roadblock. Zacha’s dynamic stickhandling, blazing foot speed and booming shot parallel the tools of a top-line NHL scorer. His competitive drive is exceptional. He wants to be a difference maker and play physical, but those factors resulted in him taking two suspensions last season totaling eight games. Zacha has an abundance of raw skills and thus, massive potential. But the 18-year-old has a lot to prove and overcome before earning an NHL roster spot. 7. Philadelphia Flyers - Ivan Provorov (D) Brandon. There are scouts who allege that Ivan Provorov is the best defenseman of the 2015 NHL Draft class, and the six-foot, 201-pounder certainly makes a case. Though he’s not as big or as fluid a skater as Noah Hanifan, Provorov’s strength, offensive talent and defensive ferocity have spurred comparisons to Duncan Keith and Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Playing on the top pairing for the WHL’s most dominant team, Provorov notched 61 points in 60 games with the Brandon Wheat Kings and took charge of the power play and penalty kill. He’s quick, intelligent, poised under pressure and commonly leads to impact physical plays. Provorov’s adeptness on the rush, at the point and battling in his own zone should lead to him having a long NHL career. Their Flyers' defense has been an ongoing issue for years and while they have made strides towards addressing that, Provorov is a big boost in that regard. 8. Columbus Blue Jackets - Zach Werenski (D) Michigan. Much like Connor McDavid overshadowed Jack Eichel, Zach Werenski has the tools to be a top-pairing defenseman in the NHL, but has been overshadowed by fellow American Noah Hanifin. Werenski joined the Michigan Wolverines as a 17-year-old and played big-time minutes. The 6’2, 214 pounder proved to be an intelligent game manager through his skating mobility and poise with the puck. Werenski is aggressive on the forecheck, which can sometimes lead to him overextending himself and forcing plays. But he didn’t look out of place on the American blueline at the World Juniors, and notched 25 points in 35 games for the Wolverines as the youngest player in the NCAA. Werenski has some attributes he needs to refine such as amping up his physicality, but he possesses the raw skill and compete level to be a top-flight NHL defenseman. 9. San Jose Sharks - Timo Meier (RW) Halifax. Meier is one of the more NHL-ready players from this year’s draft class and has the ability to step right into game action with his 6’1\", 209-pound body. He played for the Halifax Mooseheads of the QMJHL for the last two seasons and finished second on the team with 90 points (44 goals) in just 61 games last season. He also produced a franchise-record 23 power-play goals in 2014-2015. Meier can be a dominant winger and also play center to add versatility. He is a very bright player and is aware of game situations both in the offensive and defensive zone. The Swiss-born power forward was the highest-ranked player from the QMJHL and is particularly notable for his impeccable passes through traffic and hard, accurate shots on goal. He is the type of player you want on your team with his ability to create offense with his plethora of skill or shut down an opponent’s top line. 10. Colorado Avalanche - Mikko Rantanen (RW) TPS Turku (Finland) Rantanen is an enticing package of size, intelligence, and skill who is always a threat to score while on the ice. The 18-year-old Finnish prospect skated for TPS Turku of the Finnish Elite League last season where he registered nine goals and 19 assists in 56 games. He is an exceptional playmaker and speedy skater but he doesn’t play a physical game despite his 6’4\" frame. He rose to the number one ranked International skater in the Central Scouting final ranking prior to this year’s Draft. His style of play should fit in the NHL as he can protect the puck well and is difficult to check due to his size. In Rantanen, Colorado is getting a prospect that compares favorably to Ryan Getzlaf and Mikko Koivu in terms of upside. It has been a wild afternoon in the NHL as the Bruins picked up the 13th pick for Milan Lucic after they earlier traded Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for the 15th pick as well as a couple of second round selections. They owned the 14th pick heading into the draft and the rumor is that they are interested in defenseman Noah Hanifan and could trade up with their multiple picks.

He played for the Halifax Mooseheads of the QMJHL for the last two seasons and finished second on the team with 90 points (44 goals) in just 61 games last season. He also produced a franchise-record 23 power-play goals in 2014-2015. Meier can be a dominant winger and also play center to add versatility.

Colorado Avalanche - Mikko Rantanen (RW) TPS Turku (Finland) Rantanen is an enticing package of size, intelligence, and skill who is always a threat to score while on the ice. The 18-year-old Finnish prospect skated for TPS Turku of the Finnish Elite League last season where he registered nine goals and 19 assists in 56 games. He is an exceptional playmaker and speedy skater but he doesn’t play a physical game despite his 6’4\" frame. He rose to the number one ranked International skater in the Central Scouting final ranking prior to this year’s Draft. His style of play should fit in the NHL as he can protect the puck well and is difficult to check due to his size. In Rantanen, Colorado is getting a prospect that compares favorably to Ryan Getzlaf and Mikko Koivu in terms of upside. 11. Florida Panthers - Lawson Crouse (LW) Kingston At 6’4, 210 pounds, Crouse is amongst the biggest players in this draft and one of the most powerful. Though his 29-goal, 51-point output in 56 OHL games this season were below production standards for a top-10 forward pick, Crouse consistently made an impact by using his size, strength, positioning and puck skills. During the World Juniors, the London, Ontario-native proved to be a versatile two-way force, succeeding in his shutdown, bottom-six energy role with tournament champions. Crouse's prominence in the offensive zone is evident by his consistent ability to win physical battles, shield the puck, screen goaltenders and bury loose pucks. His NHL potential lies somewhere between a physical force on a top scoring line and a checking third-liner with offensive upside. 12. Dallas Stars - Denis Gurianov (RW) Lada Togliatti (Russia) Gurianov is the prototypical Russian winger. He has great size, speed and skill and he has produced solid offensive numbers throughout his young career. The 6’2, 192 pounder had one assist in eight games with Lada Togliatti in the KHL, but had a fantastic season with the club’s junior team in the MHL where he posted 15 goals and 25 points in 23 games. The risk with Guryanov doesn’t necessarily appear on the ice. Like any Russian who’s attached to a KHL team, there’s always a risk that the player’s arrival in North America may be delayed or worse, he may never show up. If Gurianov is willing to come to North America, he has the potential to be the steal of the 2015 Entry Draft. The Stars better hope so as they took a huge chance picking him at number 12. 13. Boston Bruins (via Los Angeles) - Jakub Zboril (D) Saint John. The Bruins acquired the 13th overall pick from Los Angeles as part of the Milan Lucic trade. Zboril could be this year’s home run draft pick as he has the potential to be the complete package. He is one of the smarter players in the draft class and does all the little things right. The 6’2\" Czech-born defenseman is not afraid to get nasty and has no problem defending his teammates as evident by his 73 penalty minutes in 44 games with the Saint John Sea Dogs in the QMJHL last season. But don’t let that paint the full picture of who Zboril is as he tallied 13 goals, which is a franchise record for a rookie defenseman, and 33 points with a plus-two rating last season. The smooth skating defenseman has a never-ending motor, plays with poise and confidence and can even be a potential quarterback to power plays. Zboril’s biggest asset may be his positional play as he is very sound in all three areas of the ice. 14. Boston Bruins - Jake DeBrusk (LW) Swift Current. What DeBrusk lacks in size, he makes up for with hard work and the will to battle in the dirty areas on the ice. The 5’11,\" 170-pound left winger has a knack for scoring and finding open ice in the offensive zone. DeBrusk is a natural sniper who has exceptional creativity and individual skill with his greatest strength being his compete level. Even though the 18-year-old, Edmonton-born forward doesn’t play a physical game, he will out work his opponents and is able to put up some big time scoring numbers as evident by his team-leading 42 goals and 81 points scored for the Swift Current Broncos in 72 WHL games last season. The son of former NHL player, Louie DeBrusk, he can create havoc on the forecheck and force defenders into making poor, rushed decisions that lead to goals for DeBrusk. He is an ultra-competitive, two-way forward who could eventually turn into a Zach Parise-type player down the line for the Bruins. 15. Boston Bruins (from Calgary) - Zachary Senyshyn (RW) Sault Ste. Marie. Boston surprised many by selecting the 42nd-rated Senyshyn, who is a big, skilled winger with good hands and skating ability. The 6’2, 195 pounder spent his first full junior season with the OHL’s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 2014-15, where he scored 26 goals and 45 points in 66 games. Those numbers may not stand out compared to other offensive-minded players in this draft class, but when you consider that Senyshyn played mostly in a bottom-six role on a stacked Greyhounds team, his production appears to be more than reasonable. The native of Ottawa, Ontario will surely need more time in the junior ranks, but we should see a sizeable spike in his OHL numbers next season. He appears to have all the tools to develop into a top-six winger at the NHL level, but it won't be this season. 16. New York Islanders (from Edmonton via Pittsburgh) - Mathew Barzal (C) Seattle. For Barzal, one of his greatest strengths is his lack of glaring weaknesses. As a playmaking center that is quick, smart with the puck and superb on defense, the six-foot, 183-pound Vancouver-native is an elite prospect despite missing 41 games to injury over the past two seasons. The small sample size hasn’t scared anyone off in predicting big things from Barzal, who has put up 107 points in 103 WHL games. Of the 57 points he scored in 2014-15, 45 were assists and 26 of those were primary assists. Barzal is a pass-first speedster who can be a force on either side of special teams. Scouts admire the pivot’s hockey I.Q, and warn his slick wrist shot could be just as lethal as his ability to distribute the puck. The Islanders traded defenseman Griffin Reinhart to Edmonton to get the 16th and 33rd overall picks and in Barzal they have gotten someone with top-six potential. 17. Winnipeg Jets - Kyle Connor (C) Youngstown (USHL) The Jets have a great stable of prospects and were in a position to take the best player available. Connor is a gritty, two-way player who impresses with skating and quickness. He has played for the USHL's Youngstown Phantoms for the past three seasons and led all players with 80 points in 56 games last season. The 6'1\", 177-pound winger is more of a playmaker than goal scorer as he averaged nearly an assist per game over the last two seasons with Youngstown. Connor has also made a name for himself internationally as he won gold with Team USA at the 2014 Under-18 World Junior Championship. During that tournament, the Michigan native scored four goals and three assists and tied for the lead with a plus eight rating in seven games. He has the potential to develop into an effective top-six forward in the NHL, but patience will be needed as he's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2015-2016 season. 18. Ottawa Senators - Thomas Chabot (D) Saint John. Chabot is a two-way defenseman with great size and excellent puck skills and mobility. The 6’2\", 180-pound left-hander needs to bulk up in order to make it to the big stage, but has the potential to flourish into a very reliable all-around defenseman in the NHL. He has moved up the draft class ranks very rapidly and has quickly drawn lots of scouts’ attention. Chabot led all QMJHL blueliners with 41 points (12 goals, 29 assists) in 66 games last season and was able to improve his plus minus from a minus-29 in 2013-2014 to a plus-6 last season. In the 2015 Under-18 World Juniors, the Quebec native tied for the team lead among defensemen with five points in seven games. Chabot will need some more seasoning before he will make an impact in the NHL. 19. Detroit Red Wings - Evgeni Svechnikov (LW) Cape Breton. Svechnikov is an electric, confident winger who oozes with potential. His 6’2\", 200-pound frame allows him to be aggressive on the forecheck and get physically engaged. The 18-year-old Russian is an incredibly talented and skilled winger who possesses slick skating and a lethal, accurate shot. Svechnikov came over from Russia in 2014 and played the 2014-2015 season with Cape Breton in the QMJHL where he was the team’s third leading scorer as a rookie. He amassed 32 goals and 78 points with 70 penalty minutes and a plus-19 rating in 55 games. He has adapted well to playing in North America and has learned the basics of the English language in just over a year. Svechnikov could develop into a deadly offensive threat in the NHL, but he shouldn't be expected to play at that level any time soon, especially seeing as Detroit loves to give its prospects plenty of development time in the minors. 20. Minnesota Wild - Joel Eriksson Ek (C) Farestads (Sweden) Eriksson Ek is a player that moved up the draft boards very quickly over the past few months and finished the NHL Central Scouting’s final ranks as the fourth best skater among European players. He is a 6'2\", 180-pound centerman who has a lethal shot and can be an offensive catalyst in the NHL for years to come. He uses his size well in tight situations and is a true power forward who is not afraid to go to the net and corners. Eriksson Ek can create scoring chances by using his size, puckhandling skills, and skating ability. In the 2014-15 season, he split time with Farjestad in the Swedish Hockey League, where he scored four goals and two assists in 34 games, and their junior affiliate team, where he posted 21 goals and 32 points in 25 games. Eriksson Ek also represented Sweden at the Under-18 World Juniors and scored a team best five goals and six points. 21. Ottawa (from Buffalo via New York Islanders) - Colin White (C) NTDP (USA) White is a strong two-way center who plays the game at a high level and can be an effective player even when he doesn’t have the puck due to his superior skating skills. The 6’0\", 183-pound Massachusetts-born forward is highly regarded for making players around him better and his ability to play in both the offensive and defensive zones. White played for the U.S. Under-18 National team in 2014-2015 scoring 23 goals and 54 points in 54 games played. He also notched the gold medal-clinching goal in overtime to defeat Finland at the 2015 Under-18 World Junior Championships. During that tournament, he scored six goals and added three assists in seven games en route to the gold medal. He is committed to playing the 2015-2016 season at Boston College but he should be an impact NHL player down the road. 22. Washington Capitals - Ilya Samsonov (G) Magnitogorsk (Russia) Samsonov is one of the top goaltenders in the 2015 Draft. The young Russian is big (6’3, 200 lbs) and technically sound for such a young player. The 18-year-old made his KHL debut this season with Magnitogorsk, where he allowed two goals in 21 minutes of action. Samsonov spent most of the year in the Russian Junior league, so he will definitely need more seasoning and development before he makes an impact at the NHL level. Washington doesn't have any need to rush him given Braden Holtby and Philipp Grubauer's youth, but that being said Samsonov is reportedly locked into the KHL for another three seasons. That's an awfully long time to wait to gain control of a first round pick and makes this pick a very big gamble in our minds. 23. Vancouver Canucks - Brock Boeser (RW) Waterloo (USHL) Boeser has been compared by scouts to Patrick Sharp with his natural scoring ability and his accurate and quick shot release. He is a two-way power forward who is effective at finding open space on the ice and has the ability to create scoring chances off the rush by finding open teammates with his great vision and ability to read the play. The 6-foot, 195-pound, right winger has an excellent first step and is able to quickly start and stop on the dime creating separation among defenders. At the same time, scouts are looking for Boeser to improve his defensive zone coverage as well as his board play. He played for the Waterloo Black Hawks of the USHL in the 2014-15 season where he tied for the league lead in goals with 35 and finished third in points with 68 in 57 games. He is a complete player who has the potential to become an elite-level scorer in the NHL. 24. Philadelphia Flyers (from Toronto via Nashville) - Travis Konecny (C) Ottawa. Konecny is an extremely talented winger who has the ability to play center and has the determination to do anything to win a game. The 5’10\", 172-pound forward has skated for the Ottawa 67’s of the OHL the past two seasons where he scored a combined 55 goals and 138 points in 123 games. He was drafted first overall in the 2013 OHL Priority Selection draft and named the OHL’s Rookie of the Year in the 2013-2014 season. Konecny possesses above average hockey IQ, ultra-quick stickhandling skills, and a knack for scoring with his quick shot release. Combine that with his ability to play in all three zones of the ice and his willingness to play physical when needed and you’re looking at a potential game changer. Konecny will need some further time to develop before he makes his mark in the NHL. This could be a steal for the Flyers at number 24 as Konecny was as high as 11th on some lists. 25. Winnipeg Jets (from Buffalo via St. Louis) - Jack Roslovic (C) NTDP (USA) Roslovic is a fierce competitor with incredible playmaking skills and has been known to be a pass-first type player. He is an explosive skater and uses his speed to create plays and get the puck into high traffic areas. At 6’0,\" 185 pounds, the centerman needs to bulk up a bit, but will have time to mature as he’s committed to Miami University of Ohio for 2015-2016. In 25 games with the U.S. National Under-18 Team last season, Roslovic scored 11 goals and 38 points playing on a line with 2016 highly touted prospects, Austin Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk. His stock has skyrocketed this season as he was ranked 52nd among Central Scoutings midseason North American Skater rankings and ended up climbing to the point where Winnipeg felt confident taking him with a late first round pick. He is, as is the norm with picks at this point, a project, but could turn into a really solid contributor in the NHL in a few years. 26. Montreal Canadiens - Noah Juulsen (D) Everett. Going into the 2014-15 campaign, Juulsen had already shown that he was capable of playing a responsible defensive game, but he made great strides at the other end of the ice with nine goals and 52 points in 68 contests. The 6-foot-1, 175-pound defenseman still has a lot of growing to do with the puck though. For example, while he has demonstrated some offensive creativity, he'll be expected to show growth in that regard. He also needs to be smarter in that regard and quicker on the transition when he's carrying that puck. That being said, he's capable of being a leader on the ice and he's willing to play a gritty game. There's certainly enough there to make him worth keeping in the back of your mind even if he's likely at least a couple years away from being an NHL regular. 27. Anaheim Ducks - Jacob Larsson (D) Frolunda (Sweden) Larsson is a 6’2,\" 192 pound, lanky defensemen who models his game after his favorite player, Oliver Ekman-Larsson. The Swedish born lefty is a smooth, mobile skater who makes smart plays and sees the ice well. He is an all-around defenseman who has high-end potential if he is able to bulk up and fill in his frame. Larsson spent the majority of the 2014-15 season with Frolunda’s junior team where he recorded eight goals and 11 assists in 30 games. He also played in 20 games with Frolunda’s top team last season, scoring a goal and two assists. On the international stage, Larsson was able to tally three assists in five games for team Sweden at the 2014 Under-18 World Juniors. His could be a solid top-four defenseman in the NHL down the line once he fills out a bit. Larsson will need more seasoning before he makes an impact in the NHL. 28. New York Islanders (from Tampa Bay via NY Rangers) - Anthony Beauvillier (LW) Shawinigan. In order to get the 28th selection, the Islanders sent the 33rd and 72nd overall picks to Tampa Bay. This is a well-traveled pick as it was originally the New York Rangers' and sent to the Lightning as part of the Martin St. Louis deal. At just 5’10\" and 175 pounds, Beauvillier is a slippery, tenacious, hard-working forward who possesses an impressive skill set and plays with a non-stop engine. He is an offensive scorer with above average puck-handling skills, hockey sense, and speed. Scouts have pointed out that he needs to work on his discipline and bulk up, but he is known for leading by example on the ice. He is a relentless forechecker and never quits on the play. The Quebec-native had 42 goals, 94 points, and 72 penalty minutes in 67 QMJHL games last season. He was also a very efficient centerman, leading the league in faceoff wins last season. 29. Columbus (from Toronto via Philadelphia and Tampa Bay) - Gabriel Carlsson (D) Linkopings (Sweden) Carlsson is a big body, who is extremely smart in his own zone, but unlike fellow countrymen Erik Karlsson and Oliver Ekman-Larsson, he doesn't have much offensive upside. The 6’4, 183 pound Swede played for Linkoping in the Swedish junior league where he registered no goals, seven assists and 14 penalty minutes in 39 games. He also represented Sweden at the Ivan Hlinka (U18) tournament, where he registered one assist in five games. Although his ceiling might not be very high, he is an intriguing prospect because scouts know exactly what to expect from him at the next level. If he's able to improve his play with the puck even a little bit, he should be able to develop into a shutdown defenseman on an NHL roster. 30. Arizona Coyotes (from Chicago) - Nick Merkley (RW) Kelowna. Merkley is an undersized forward with elite playmaking skills who can also play center at 5’10\" and 187 pounds. He creates scoring chances as good as anyone in this year’s draft class and his work ethic is second to none. Merkley’s critics have said he is not the strongest skater, but due to his extremely high hockey IQ, he can be a valuable asset in the NHL similar to the way Tyler Johnson has become. Despite his small frame, he is still not afraid to do the dirty work by battling in front of the net and pick up scoring chances the hard way. He has spent the last three seasons with the WHL’s Kelowna Rockets and scored 90 points (20 goals and 70 assists) with 79 penalty minutes in 2014-2015. All-in-all, he is a player with high upside due to his exceptional puckhandling ability and decision making. Merkley could be a steal at number 30 as many experts had him ranked in the top 15. continue story »",

    "DiffbotBody": "There’s nothing wrong with snacking – provided you’re choosing the right snacks, which don’t include the ones on the list below. We’ve read label upon label and picked out the very worst snacks, in no particular order, that should never go in your face. 1. Cheetos Many people ask, “What is a Cheeto, anyway?” Well, it’s highly processed corn that’s fried, infused with sodium and showered in orangey-red chemical dust. Serving size: Cheetos Flamin’ Hot, 1 ounce, about 21 pieces Fat: 11 grams Calories: 160 Sodium: 250 milligrams Carbs: 13 g Protein: 1g Sugar: 0g 2. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts The ingredient list alone in Krispy Kremes reads like an advanced chemistry class. Not to mention, bleached white flour that’s deep-fried and rolled in sugar is just never a good idea. Serving size: 1 original glazed doughnut Calories: 190 Fat: 11g Carbs: 21g Protein: 2g Sodium: 75mg Sugar: 10g 3. Pork rinds These may seem like a hearty, protein-filled snack, but are really just sodium-filled strips of crunchy pig fat. Serving size: 1 cup Calories: 174 Fat: 10g Carbs: 0g Protein: 19.62g Sodium: 588mg 4. Ruffles Cheddar and Sour Cream Potato Chips It’s no surprise that chips aren’t great for you, but the ones flavored with “cheese” or other dairy products are the worst. How about a sprinkling of some artificially-flavored and dyed chemical powder? No, thanks. Serving size: 11 chips (1 oz) Calories: 160 Fat: 11g Carbs: 14g Protein: 2g Sodium: 230mg 5. Skittles Taste the rainbow of artificial coloring and flavoring. A package of Skittles is like a bag of mini sugar bombs brimming with corn syrup and trans fats. Serving size: 1 bag Calories: 231 Fat: 2.49g Carbs: 51.66g Protein: .11g Sodium: 9 mg Sugar: 43.33 6. Haagen Dazs Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream Chocolate and peanut butter is delicious, but the calories, fat and sugar content in this one is through the roof. (And will you really limit yourself to half a cup?) Try a chocolate peanut butter smoothie bowl instead. Serving size: ½ cup Calories: 340 Fat: 23g Carbs: 26g Protein: 8g Sodium: 85 mg Sugar: 22g 7. Easy Cheese Easy cheese is kinda cheese, but not really. It also has a slew of chemicals and preservatives added in order to pour the stuff in a can and make it soft enough to squirt out of a one-centimeter spout. Serving size: 1.1 oz (about two tablespoons) Calories: 90 Fat: 6g Carbs: 2g Protein: 4g Sodium: 430mg Sugar: 2g 8. Ritz Crackers While you’re ditching the Easy Cheese, dump these crackers as well. Crackers seem harmless, but if you want to be healthy, don’t put on this Ritz. There’s little nutritional value and zero fiber, but what they do contain is high fructose corn syrup and saturated fat. Serving size: 5 crackers Calories: 77 Fat: 3.5g Carbs: 9.5g Protein: 1.2g Sodium: 86mg Sugar: 1.3g 9. Twinkies Twinkies are such a processed weird wonder that someone actually wrote a book about its 37 ingredients, which include sulfuric acid, ethylene, lime, and phosphoric acid. What are those? Not food. Try a healthier version. Serving size: 1 Twinkie Calories: 270 Fat: 9g Carbs: 46g Protein: 2g Sodium: 360mg Sugar: 33g 10. Mrs. Fields Milk Chocolate Chip Cookies Of all the store-bought cookies, Mrs. Fields topped the list in terms of calories and fat content. With 210 calories in just one cookie, it’s best to stay away. Serving size: 1 cookie Calories: 210 Fat: 10g Carbs: 29g Protein: 2g Sodium: 170mg Sugar: 19g 11. Hot Pockets What’s in your pocket? Let’s see: partially hydrogenated soybean oil, corn syrup solids, fake mozzarella cheese, artificial butter flavor, distilled monoglycerides and L-Cysteine hydrochloride. Oh, and in 2014, Hot Pockets were pulled from store shelves for containing “diseased and unsound animals.” Definitely not a pocket full of sunshine. 1 sandwich (Pepperoni Pizza) Calories: 290 Fat: 11g Carbs: 35g Protein: 11g Sodium: 590mg Sugar: 5g 12. Peanut butters with hydrogenated oil Yes, peanut butter can be good for you, but not all peanut butters are the same. Hydrogenation is a chemical process that converts liquid vegetable oil into solid fat – unnecessary for peanut butter. Check the labels – PB really only needs peanuts and salt. Yes, you’ll have to stir it, but it’s so worth it, and once you make the switch, you’ll never go back. Serving size: 2 tablespoons Calories: 190 Fat: 16g Carbs: 8g Protein: 7g Sodium: 135mg Sugar: 3g 13. Microwave Popcorn While popcorn in general is not bad for you, the lining of microwave popcorn bags includes substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a chemical the EPA lists as a carcinogen that has been linked to infertility and cancer. In addition, many brands include trans fats – and just look at all that sodium! Pop Secret Butter 1 bag Calories: 540 Fat: 36g Carbs: 45g Protein: 6g Sodium: 930mg Sugar: 0g 14. Toaster pastries Another “food” devoid of any nutritional value but containing plenty of bleached white flour, high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated palm oil. Serving size: Toaster Strudel, strawberry, 2 pastries Calories: 340 Fat: 14g Carbs: 50, Protein: 3g Sugar: 18g Sodium: 340mg 15. Frozen Chicken Nuggets Rumors of pink slime aside, an abundance of fat (including saturated fat) and sodium make chicken nuggets a nope. Serving size: Tyson Fun Nuggets, 5 pieces Calories: 276 Fat: 17.7g Carbs: 15.8g Protein: 13.8g Sodium: 483mg Sugar: 0g 16. Diet Soda Although it’s got no calories or fat, the artificial sweeteners and chemical dyes make this a poor choice. In fact, the sweeteners can mess up your metabolism and have been linked to an increased risk of weight gain and depression. Serving size: 1 can Calories: 0 Fat: 0g Carbs: 15.8g Protein: 0g Sodium: 67mg Sugar: 0g 17. Cheez-Its Sadly, Cheez-Its are mostly flour, oil and a little bit of cheese. You’ll find no fiber in this cracker, but you will find a preservative called TBHQ (tertiary butylhydroquinone), a form of butane. Serving size: 27 crackers Calories: 150 Fat: 8g Carbs: 17g Protein: 3g Sodium: 230mg Sugar: 1g 18. Three Musketeers The good ol’ Three Musketeers bar sounds harmless – I mean, it’s just chocolate and that creamy nougat filling, right? Yeah, but that nougat is basically a boatload of fluffy sugar with some corn syrup and hydrogenated palm oil thrown in. Serving size: 1 bar Calories: 240 Fat: 7g Carbs: 42g Protein: 1g Sodium: 90mg Sugar: 36g 19. Sugary coffee shop drinks One innocent drink from Starbucks might be delicious, but its got enough calories, sugar, and fat to replace an entire meal. Serving size: Starbucks White Chocolate Mocha, Venti (large) Calories: 510 Fat: 15g Carbs: 77g Protein: 19g Sodium: 300mg 20. Canned fruit Fruit is a wonderful snack! But eat it fresh, please. Canned fruits are stripped of many nutrients, contain added sugars and the cans are lined with chemical preservatives. Serving size: 1 can peaches Calories: 100 Fat: 0g Carbs: 25g Protein: 0g Sodium: 10mg Sugar: 22g To find out the worst 30 foods at your favorite chain restaurants, CLICK HERE.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Scott Disick has cancelled a Las Vegas club appearance scheduled for Friday night. The 32-year-old pulled out of a stint at 1Oak a day before he was scheduled to appear, according to TMZ. It was set to be Scott's first public appearance since it was revealed that he has split from Kourtney Kardashian after nine years and three children together. Scroll down for video Scott posted a flyer for the event on his Instagram page on Tuesday, asking fans to 'come party' with him. He has since deleted it. The news comes on the same day it was claimed that the reality star went in and out of rehab in Florida on Sunday. Us Weekly reports that Scott spent just a few hours in the centre, which is believed to be near where he is staying with rumoured ex-girlfriend Chloe Bartoli. 'Come party with me': The reality star posted a flyer promoting his nightclub stint on Instagram on Wednesday, but he has since deleted it While photos of Scott looking very cosy with Chloe in France are thought to be what led to Kourtney ending their relationship, it has been claimed that his partying also contributed. It's unclear if the reality star cancelled his club appearance in a bid to show his ex-girlfriend that he is trying to reform his bad boy ways, or if he wants to avoid being grilled about the split on the red carpet. Kourtney and Scott have three children together, Mason, five, Penelope, who turned three on Wednesday, and six-month-old Reign. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star took Penelope to Disneyland for her third birthday, and Scott posted a forlorn message to his only daughter on Instagram. Along with a collage of photos of his little girl, he wrote: '1 of the only things I'm proud off [sic] about myself. Happybdayp.' On Thursday, TMZ claimed that Kourtney packed up Scott's belongings at their home and sent them to his bachelor pad in Beverly Hills. Although Scott appears to be sad about the end of his almost decade long relationship, he apparently is not necessarily convinced that it is over for good. 'Scott says that he's doing fine,' a source told People, adding that he is not taking the break-up seriously. 'He says that he is not upset that the relationship is over, because \"over\" doesn't always mean \"over.\" He has left open the door to getting back with her.' The insider added: 'But he's open to the idea that she may not forgive him and it may really be over for good, and he's okay with that, too. Right now his feeling is, whatever happens, happens.'",

'Scott says that he's doing fine,' a source told People, adding that he is not taking the break-up seriously. 'He says that he is not upset that the relationship is over, because \"over\" doesn't always mean \"over.\" He has left open the door to getting back with her.' Caught on camera: Lord Disick was seen looking very cosy with rumoured ex Chloe Bartoli in France last week. Kicked out: Kourtney has allegedly packed up Scott's belongings and sent them to his Beverly Hills bachelor pad.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Scientists have figured out how to separate the pain relieving qualities of medical marijuana from its psychological side-effects in an effort to offer people a new high-free option. The research focussed on the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, known as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is not only responsible for the high associated with the drug - plus hallucinations, delusions, memory loss, and feelings of anxiety or calm - it’s also been shown to slow tumour growth in mice. And now, scientists have figured out that the mechanisms by which the drug delivers its desired medical effects and negative psychological effects work independently from one another - which means that one can be switched off while the other one works its magic. \"There has been a great deal of medical interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms at work in THC, so that the beneficial effects can be harnessed without the side-effects,\" one of the team, Peter McCormick from the University of East Anglia in the UK said in press release. \"THC acts through a family of cell receptors called cannabinoid receptors. Our previous research revealed which of these receptors are responsible for the anti-tumour effects of THC. This new research demonstrates how some of the drug's beneficial effects can be separated from its unwanted side effects.\" When investigating how THC is able to shrink tumours, the researchers figured out that negative psychological side-effects of the drug, such as memory defects, mood swings, anxiety, and paranoia, were triggered by a single pathway in the brain that was separate from the pathway that triggers the drug’s cancer-killing properties. In an effort to better understand the drug’s ability to cause these negative effects, the team isolated this particular pathway and experimented on it in mice. They noticed that two types of cell receptors were present in this pathway - the cannabinoid receptor and the serotonin receptor - and these happened to be positioned very close together, which suggested that the drug was acting on both at the same time. To figure out what effect this was having, the team blocked the activity of a specific type of serotonin receptor - called 5HT2AR - in the brains of mice, and gave them a dose of pure THC. The mice were then put through memory, behaviour, pain, and motor skills tests. \"These animals, lacking the serotonin receptor, showed differences only in the memory and mood tests - not in the pain tests,\" McCormick told Liat Clark at Wired. \"There were no side effects in memory, and that's exactly what we were looking for.\" Reporting the results in PLOS Biology, the team says with 5HT2AR turned off in mice, the THC was still able to reduce pain as well as tumour growth, but without the negative psychological effects. What they want to do now is figure out if the same mechanisms are in play in human brains, and then see if they can mimic the same serotonin receptor-blocking effect they achieved in the mice. McCormick calls this effect a \"Chinese wall\" that sits between the serotonin and cannabinoid receptors, and thinks it could be the key to medical marijuana without the negative side effects. \"For me, the ideal drug would be in one of two scenarios: a drug that does not recognise the THC cannabinoid receptor when near serotonin, or alternatively a drug you could add with THC that would provide that Chinese wall between the two,\" he told Wired.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With the majority of head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad back in pre-season training, preparations for Tottenham Hotspur's 2014-15 campaign are well underway. For supporters, glimpses of the team's sessions on social media are better than nothing after a month away. But the opportunity to actually see their team in action—players new and old working together for the first time—that is when things begin to feel real again. Over the following pages Bleacher Report looks at Tottenham's announced opponents for this summer's friendlies. We begin with the League One outfit hosting a Spurs XI side (likely consisting of development squad talent and any auxiliary players Pochettino needs to run the rule over), right up to the big-name opposition the first team will face just days prior to the Premier League season opener. Pre-season only tells us so much, but they are nonetheless fascinating steps toward the proper action beginning. Begin Slideshow » Tottenham's first opponents of the summer, Peterborough United, got their pre-season off to a winning start this past week with a 3-2 win over Dulwich Hamlet. On the scoresheet was striker Joe Gormley, signed in June after netting 40 goals for Northern Irish side Cliftonville last season. The 26-year-old's scoring exploits saw him mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by UEFA.com's Darren Fullerton in the spring. Now Peterborough manager Dave Robertson is hoping Gormley can help fire his team out of League One. \"I'm over the moon, he's a fantastic signing for us,\" Robertson told The Posh TV. \"We know that Joe is going to bring goals to the team next season.\" Ninth in England's third tier last season, Posh have also added former West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison to a squad that includes former Spurs goalkeeper Ben Alnwick. The new blood, coupled with last season's experience, has suitably raised expectations. \"Anything but promotion is failure in my eyes,\" defender Michael Smith admitted to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, per BBC Sport. With a game against West Ham already under their belts by then, Peterborough should be in shape to provide Spurs a decent examination of their burgeoning fitness levels. After 2014's three-match North American tour, Tottenham make a briefer visit to the States this year as they participate in the MLS All-Star Game. The eighth English club to be invited to take on the league's best since the old East vs. West All-Star format was abandoned, Spurs follow Bayern Munich who were defeated 2-1 in last year's match. Preferring to keep most of his team's preparations closer to home, the fixture is Pochettino's one pre-season concession to the now-routine activity of Premier League clubs heading overseas to further their global brand. Despite being a primarily commercial exercise, Spurs should find an exacting on-pitch challenge in the form of an MLS select group attempting to again demonstrate their ability against one of European football's famous old names. The still-to-be-confirmed team could well feature former Spurs striker Robbie Keane, in his fifth year with the division's reigning champions Los Angeles Galaxy. For several of Pochettino's team, it will be their first opportunity to get some important minutes in their legs ahead of the Premier League season. Those not making the trip to Colorado will be heading to Hertfordshire as Spurs open August away at . A frequent pre-season opponent over the years, Stevenage's Lamex Stadium also hosts the club's under-21 fixtures that don't take place at the training ground or White Hart Lane. This latest meeting carries extra intrigue in that it is one of the first games for recently installed Stevenage boss and Spurs Hall of Fame inductee Teddy Sheringham. \"The aim is to do better than last season,\" said Sheringham to his new club's official website following his appointment, while understanding that will be difficult given they reached the League Two play-off semi-final. The existing Spurs links at the club did not escape him either. \"I know a few of the boys, the likes of Chris Day were at Tottenham, I think Charlie Lee might have kicked me once or twice when he was coming through the ranks. I know Ronnie Henry too.\" Defender Mark Hughes, midfielder Steven Schumacher and centre-forward Brett Williams have all been drafted in to join those already there. Sheringham told the club's website he intends \"to bring in two or three more players at least\" but also stated \"I like what I have got now, the base of what we have looks really good.\" The Boro first team plays Wealdstone in its first friendly this weekend before visiting St Neots Town next week. Prior to taking on Tottenham in the final warm-up before the season begins, Sheringham's squad will take on another two of his old clubs, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, , have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him. Indeed, the Mirror's Liam Corless reports Real fans were chanting not-so-secret target David De Gea's name during the unveiling of the aforementioned signing from Porto. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid, Tottenham will have one more match in Munich the following day. They will face either or hosts Bayern in either the third/fourth play-off or final. Last season's 10th-place finish in Serie A has prompted change on and off the pitch at Milan. Pippo Inzaghi has been replaced with Sampdoria boss Sinisa Mihajlovic in the San Siro hot seat (almost as toasty as that found at the Bernabeu). Luiz Adriano and Carlos Bacca formerly of Shakhtar Donetsk and Sevilla, respectively, have been brought in to bolster the team's flagging attack. From within Italian borders they have drafted in Andrea Bertolacci and Luca Antonelli to try and improve things in midfield and defence. The Rossoneri would kill for the kind of season Bayern Munich had. Despite a dominant run to the Bundesliga title, the failure to win the Champions League has upped the pressure on Pep Guardiola. Bayern have been brilliant more often than not on his watch. Yet Guardiola's inability thus far to replicate the success enjoyed by the team in Jupp Heynckes' final season two years ago could count against him soon enough, no matter the difficulty of matching 2012-13's extraordinary treble. Should Spurs cross paths with Bayern in August, and depending on the circumstances, they could be witness to a fascinating atmosphere at the Allianz Arena. Iffy performances from the German side in their own tournament do not necessarily mean anything at such an early stage. But Guardiola and his team would prefer to launch their latest pursuit for glory and history in the most positive fashion possible.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment PEORIA — A former Manual Academy principal who resigned abruptly over differences with Grenita Lathan in 2011 has been named to replace Lathan as superintendent of Peoria School District 150 for the next year. District 150 board members voted 4 to 2 to appoint Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat as acting superintendent until Aug. 7, when Lathan’s resignation becomes effective — and as interim superintendent until June 30, 2016, when Lathan’s contract would have expired. Desmoulin-Kherat, currently associate superintendent of Danville Public Schools District 118, has been rumored as a top contender to replace Lathan for months. Board members Linda Butler and Rick Cloyd said they voted against her appointment because they disagreed with the process, not the person. Cloyd noted that Change150, the citizens’ group that has been a prime force behind a movement to oust Lathan, has consistently called for the district to be more transparent, accountable and communicative. “My concern is the process we’ve entered into doesn’t meet any of the criteria we’ve heard from the public or the podium for a great deal of time,” Cloyd said. “The way we’ve accomplished this resolution falls well short of expectations of the community and those who were passionately concerned about how we do our work.” No potential candidates, including Desmoulin-Kherat, were interviewed, Butler added. Butler said she had suggested board members interview three out of the several people who had expressed interest in serving as acting superintendent. But her colleagues opted to make the decision based on resumes and their opinions. Board president Martha Ross said the district needs stability. “This does not preclude us from putting together a team to look at someone permanent down the line,” Ross said. “We’re in such a dilemma right now, we need to have someone in place.” Sea Stipe, a spokesman for Change150, said all of the players in Change150’s coalition support Desmoulin-Kherat, including District 150’s employee unions, retired District 150 administrators and the NAACP. Board members went into executive session to discuss the terms of a contract offer to Desmoulin-Kherat. They are scheduled to vote on the contract at the next board meeting July 20. Desmoulin-Kherat’s appointment comes after a whirlwind week in which Lathan announced her resignation a day before board members were scheduled to discuss terminating her contract. Desmoulin-Kherat also made a splash when she announced she was resigning as Manual’s principal the week school started in 2011. Sources said she and Lathan had clashed over how much autonomy she would have to run Manual. She served as transformation officer for Springfield Public Schools District 186 from 2011 to 2013, when she became associate superintendent in Danville. Desmoulin-Kherat had recently been an unsuccessful candidate for superintendent’s jobs in Danville and Freeport.

Board to consider terminating Superintendent Grenita Lathan or placing her on administrative leave, plus appointing an acting superintendent. Board members Lynne Costic and Martha Ross said they had the item placed on the agenda for discussion. June 30: Lathan resigns. During a news conference, she says she was honored to serve as superintendent, but does not answer questions. Outgoing board Vice President Linda Butler questions the timing and motivation of Costic and Ross’ move. Wednesday: New board members Dan Adler and Ernestine Jackson, who had pledged to oust Lathan, sworn in. Ross, the board’s longest-serving member, finally elected president. Instead of discussing terminating Lathan’s contract in executive session, they discuss terms of her separation agreement. Thursday: In a special meeting, board unanimously approves Lathan’s offer to resign. She asked to use vacation days until Aug. 7, when her resignation becomes effective, and a letter of recommendation. She also will be paid for 67 remaining unused vacation days, less than $60,000. Friday: Houston Chronicle education blog reports Lathan hired for newly created position of elementary school transformation officer at Houston Independent Public Schools. Monday: Board names former Manual Academy Principal Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat to replace Lathan. Desmoulin-Kherat is current associate superintendent of Danville public schools.

Newstell Marable Sr., longtime president of the Pottstown Chapter of the NAACP, died at the age of 84 in January, two days after Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Over the past few months borough council has discussed naming something in his honor. It will make a decision in August about naming the half-acre park at Chestnut and North Washington streets after conferring with Marable's widow, Millicent. Councilwoman Sheryl A. Miller suggested the park at Monday's meeting, at which Mayor Sharon Valentine-Thomas also read a proclamation honoring Marable's work advocating fair labor and housing, among other social justice causes. Marable's sister, Margaret Seltmann, and other family members attended the meeting to receive the written recognition. \"Until his passing, he was still trying to say we must find something in this community to provide jobs for our adults and keep them in this town,\" Seltmann said. Councilman Joseph L. Kirkland said Marable was a mentor to him. \"I always appreciated his input and followed his advice,\" Kirkland said, adding that the biggest lesson he learned was to always listen to opposing viewpoints. Bishop Everett V. Debnam, senior pastor at Invictus Church on Hanover Street, said Marable was one of the first people he met when he moved to Pottstown 28 years ago. \"He had the same goals I had,\" Debnam said. Debnam, Marable and about 300 others visited the Pottsgrove and Boyertown school districts at various times as advocates for integration and equality. Debnam said the 1990s were a particularly difficult time in Boyertown because the Ku Klux Klan was still active in the area. But, he said, Marable was never intimidated. \"He stood for people of color,\" Debnam said. \"And don't get offended. White is a color, too. He stood for people. He stood for humanity.\" Contact Paige Cooperstein: 610-371-5021 or pcooperstein@readingeagle.com.",

    "LabBody": "A study by a Cornell sociologist showed that the children of more affluent parents frequently pick majors in college that might not yield lucrative careers. Sociologist Kim Weeden looked at data from National Center for Education Statistics and determined that wealthy kids major in English. Or history. Or the visual and performing arts. Students from lower-income families study more pragmatic subjects like computer science, medicine, nursing and education. The reason for this result might not simply be that rich kids get to be more whimsical with what they study in college. Different types of schools also offer different majors. From The Atlantic: Most of the priciest, top-tier schools don’t offer Law Enforcement as a major, for instance. There is also the possibility that children from higher-income families were more exposed to the sorts of art, music, and literature that colleges deem worthy of study, an exposure that might inspire them to pursue those subjects when they get to college. See the gallery to learn to which majors correlate with big paychecks for that student’s parents.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Big Agnes This tent will change the way you think about camping. The free-standing, three-season design boasts an 81-square-foot floor and a height of 75 inches--room enough to sleep six if you’re good friends, and plenty of room to accommodate lesser parties. Pair the Big House with the Tent Vestibule ($120), which attaches to the tent door to proffer another 44 square feet of dry storage and shelter. Color-coded poles make assembly a breeze, and the welcome mat helps keep the outside from getting tracked in. Cascade Designs This award-winning camp bed includes four inches of open-cell padding along with Thermarest’s inflatable NeoAir mattress--one of the best backcountry sleeping pads on the market. The stuff sack doubles as a pump, and the soft fleece lining feels heavenly against your skin. Better yet, the NeoAir mattress can be removed for when you’re ready to branch out into overnight backpacking. Primus Camping Dodge the woes of wet wood and cook with a roaring 24,000 BTUs of heat with the Firehole 200--that’s enough to get boiling water in three minutes. It folds up like a suitcase, and has adjustable feet to handle uneven surfaces. The stainless steel grate can support cast iron pots and pans, and the windscreens double as a small prep area. It runs on easy-to-find one-pound propane canisters, and lights up with a twist-click. Alps Mountaineering Most drive-up campsites have picnic tables--but you’ll still love the extra space afforded by this fold-up table. Assembly is a breeze. The top accordions out from its packed size to sit on a sturdy anodized aluminum X frame, it stands 28 inches tall and comes with a stuff sack. REI This lightweight, collapsible camping chair adds a bit of front porch luxury to your campsite. The fabric sling sits on durable aluminum poles and offers full back support, and the bamboo rockers are wide and long enough to keep you rockin’ without worry, even as the evening turns to night and things start to get rowdy. BioLite Stove The three-in-one PowerLight lantern/flashlight/powerbank can recharge up to three iPhones and burn at 250 lumins for up to 72 hours on a single charge (via USB). But add the SiteLight accessory and suddenly your camp has the ambient light you never knew you needed. The twin lanterns (each with an illumination range of ten feet) are strung together on 20 feet of cord. Just plug ‘em into the PowerLight and string ‘em up; they’ll run for 22 hours on a single charge. Snow Peak One light system for your camp, another for your tent. This ingenious lantern takes its design lead from the Japanese Hozuki plant and hangs off a strong magnetic fastener that you can thread through loops inside your tent. It casts 60 lumens of light at full bore, running off three AAA batteries. But the silicone shade mellows out the glare. You can also adjust it to low or strobe mode--or take advantage of the Mini Huzuki’s playful flicker setting; the low-cast light that actually flickers like a candle when there are variations in wind or sound. We love the city—and as the summer sets in and the asphalt turns scorching—we love leaving the city for the wild beyond afforded by car camping. National, regional, or state, any park with unfettered access to nature will suffice, and these products provide the right amount of comfort without going full-on glamping.

Vacation romances, cross-cultural connections, and even long-distance relationships could be our new normal. Venus turns retrograde from July 25 to September 6, which could bring some blasts from the past. If an ex sends a Snapchat, think twice before you open it. If you’re getting married while Venus is in reverse, it’s always wise to do a vow renewal on your first anniversary — just for certainty’s sake.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENT Both the AFL and Gold Coast have continued to suggest that Karmichael Hunt has done so much good for the game in placing it on the map in foreign territory that his sorry parting gesture should be judged in that context. Photo: Getty Images It is disappointing that Gold Coast Suns' chiefs have chosen to adopt the AFL's line about Karmichael Hunt. Both the competition's governing body and its young club have continued to suggest that the code-hopper has done so much good for the game in placing it on the map in foreign territory and that his sorry parting gesture should be judged in that context. No one is asking them to publicly savage Hunt's character, but this is misguided spin. No one, least of all the Gold Coast community, would be hoodwinked by it. And it is distasteful to extol the promotional value of a sportsman, then almost 28, who in 2014 deliberately purchased illegal drugs to be shared at an end-of-season celebration involving significantly younger players, including impressionable teenagers. It is understood that three of the current Suns footballers named by Hunt to the Queensland Crime Commission last week self reported their illicit drug use. They will not be charged or further investigated as a result of Hunt's evidence, but now face ongoing target testing. Either way it is that self-reporting loophole in the AFL's three strikes drug code that riles so many clubs including the Gold Coast. Club president John Witheriff has been silent throughout the public fallout from the Suns' drug revelations but is reportedly determined to push for reform. He has been debating the key elements of the proposed changes with AFL boss Gillon McLachlan over the past week. Even the AFL medical directors Peter Harcourt and Harry Unglick appear close to accepting the self-report mechanism may be removed given its potential for abuse. While advocates of the system say it was working as intended until a group of Collingwood footballers took advantage of it three years ago, the appetite for a tougher approach is expected to see it removed as part of the illicit drugs review. That review moves further towards its final stage next week when the AFL Players Association take the review to footballers across every team around Australia. Witheriff was reportedly scheduled to publicly address his club's issues and proposed reforms on the eve of Saturday's clash in Cairns with the Western Bulldogs. However the precarious nature of Harley Bennell's circumstances, sensitivity surrounding Bennell's current emotional state and the fact Gold Coast has not yet formulated a full program for his rehabilitation nor an official return date saw the president, shell-shocked and angry at various stages over the past fortnight, postpone press conference plans. All of that along with proposed reform at the club will be outlined by Witheriff next week. With the players union and Bennell pushing to return in round 16 against GWS, the process-driven Witheriff is expected to next week announce as much, along with a series of preventative mechanisms put in place by the club particularly surrounding the players' downtime, Mad Mondays and post-season trips and other celebrations. The Suns have a poor post-season reputation largely thanks to Campbell Brown. Serious problems remain but a series of investigations at the club over the past fortnight have supposedly satisfied both the Suns and the AFL that drug abuse within the team was neither systemic nor widespread. Fairfax Media has no reason to disbelieve this. The Gold Coast listed players were individually interviewed by AFLPA staffers and lawyers in the week that followed the Hunt revelations and over recent days the club has been investigated by the AFL's integrity unit. Both players union bosses and AFL integrity chief Brett Clothier reportedly told Witheriff and his executive the Gold Coast had work to do but did not boast a playing group with a drug culture. But it would be misguided of Witheriff to back away from his club's annus horribilis by focusing upon improved infrastructure at Metricon or point to corporate, government and community support by way of whitewashing the matter at hand. The club has already failed the competition, itself and its pioneering mission by failing to see the wood for the trees. And Hunt? He has made a fool of some of the AFL's most respected executives from Andrew Demetriou down. David Matthews, Travis Auld and Scott Clayton must all now be questioning the due diligence — or lack thereof — which went into the multimillion move to headhunt him. The competition looks even more foolish now given that its initial response after Hunt was charged was that the alleged actions took place after Hunt had officially departed the AFL system. To continue to defend Hunt's value to the game is embarrassing. He worked hard to achieve his 44 AFL games but the AFL and the Gold Coast paid him $5 million over five years to do so. Given that the large proportion of that money was ambassadorial, it was surely not too much to ask that he stayed away from illegal drugs while fulfilling the role. Meanwhile the Suns are right to be regarding a future without Bennell and Charlie Dixon. Both will find plenty of suitors and both would benefit from a new home and the tough love thrust upon them by a new leadership group. Both are repeat offenders now with attitude issues and the stakes are too high for the one-time \"community club\" to accommodate them. The seemingly never-ending supplements saga is set to spread into another preseason. Photo: Phil Carrick The World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal of the verdict in the Essendon case is set to be heard from mid-November in Sydney. The Court of Arbitration for Sport is understood to have determined that the hearing begin from mid-November and parties also have been informed that it will be in Sydney, as Fairfax Media has previously reported. While to have the hearing in November means that the 34 current and former Essendon players - 17 of whom remain on the Dons' list - will have completed the 2015 season, the Bombers will endure another post-season exchange period and free agency period with their players not knowing their ultimate fate. It also means the saga will drag into a fourth preseason. The case may be ongoing when the national draft is held. The CAS's decision to hold the appeal in Sydney clearly takes into account that many of those acting for the parties - particularly the players and expert witnesses - are based in Australia and sources suggested it would be a less costly exercise than the alternative of holding the hearing in Switzerland, where the CAS has its headquarters. Essendon's list management has been hampered by the doping saga, due to the uncertainly surrounding whether players would be suspended, and the fact that players from rival clubs - as James Hird recently said - have been reluctant to cross to the club in this period. The club also lost draft picks in 2013 and 2014 but has no restrictions this year. The players were cleared by the AFL's anti-doping tribunal on the eve of the season before WADA reviewed the evidence and launched its appeal against the verdict. It is unclear how long the case would take, and while the hearing is a fresh one- with either party permitted to introduce new material - the three man panel that judges it does not have to re-hear evidence that was submitted in the first hearing, at the AFL tribunal. The WADA case is being led by renowned Colorado-based anti-doping expert and lawyer Richard Young, who helped to write the WADA code and was among those who prosecuted the Lance Armstrong case in the United States.",

    "DiffbotBody": "President Obama this week has found himself at odds with allies in Congress and in organized labor over lifting the 40-year ban on U.S. crude oil exports, with the White House still blocking efforts to ship American fuel abroad despite growing support for the idea and mounting evidence that exports will drive down domestic gasoline prices. Just this week, two powerful labor unions — the Laborers’ International Union of North America and the International Union of Operating Engineers — joined in a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation lifting the ban, which has stood since the energy crisis years of the 1970s. Bills to remove the prohibition are gaining steam in both houses of Congress, where more and more Democrats are bucking the administration and calling for the U.S. to take full advantage of its abundance of energy. At the same time, a recent Government Accountability Office review found evidence that lifting the ban could reduce domestic gasoline prices by as much as 13 cents a gallon and “would lead to additional investment in crude oil production and increases in employment.” For Mr. Obama, the crude oil debate has once again pitted him against his traditional friends in organized labor. Major labor unions also have criticized the president for refusing to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the administration admits would create more than 40,000 jobs. On oil exports, some unions say the White House is missing a golden opportunity to spur economic growth at a time when fewer and fewer Americans are participating in the workforce. Studies from Harvard and the GAO show that lifting a ban on ... more \u003e “Opening global markets to U.S. producers will support added domestic production that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and contribute tens of billions of GDP dollars in the supply chain within the next few years. At the same time, we will put downward pressure on domestic fuel prices, while we provide our allies and trading partners with an alternative to sourcing energy from unfriendly and unstable sources,” reads the letter to House leaders, signed by labor unions, manufacturing groups and a host of others who support repealing the ban. The letter specifically calls for the passage of House Bill 702, which would dramatically ease restrictions on exports. The bill has more than 70 co-sponsors, and similar bipartisan legislation also has emerged in the Senate. Crafted four decades ago, the ban was meant to conserve all American oil and protect the country from fuel shortages in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo that sought to punish the U.S. for its support of Israel. Today, fears of fuel shortages no longer exist, with the U.S. now entrenched as the world’s largest producer of both oil and natural gas. While the administration slowly has opened the door to gas exports, shipping crude oil around the world remains forbidden. The White House confirmed Thursday it has not changed its position on crude oil exports. Officials previously have expressed concern that lifting the ban would lead to higher gas prices at home. But a host of studies, including one from Harvard Business School and the Boston Consulting Group, along with the recent review, say otherwise. With the gas prices question seemingly answered, a growing number of Democrats are joining with Republicans in pushing legislation to overturn the ban. “The advantages of lifting the ban on crude oil exports are not just theoretical talking points discussed in the halls of Congress, but rather supported by a large and growing body of research by government agencies, academic institutions and think tanks across the political spectrum,” Rep. Joe Barton, Texas Republican, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, Texas Democrat, wrote in a joint op-ed for Roll Call on Thursday. “We will continue to push our colleagues and the president to take action to end the decades-old ban on oil exports and make the U.S. a global energy superpower. Anything short of repeal would be a missed opportunity,” the two men wrote. Mr. Barton serves on the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power, which held a hearing Thursday on legislation to revoke the ban. In addition to the economic benefits — which now are nearly impossible to deny — the subcommittee also heard from U.S. allies who say access to American crude oil would bring significant national security benefits to their nations by making them less dependent on politically motivated embargoes and cutoffs from nations such as Russia. “The larger the number of stable democracies among the world’s exporters, the more robust the energy security of the Czech Republic and the European Union will be,” Petr Gandalovic, the Czech Republic’s ambassador to the U.S., told the subcommittee. But the export ban still has passionate supporters inside and outside Washington. Some argue that once the ban is lifted, exports naturally would flow to China, not Europe, giving Beijing access to relatively cheap energy as it continues to increase its economic clout. Backers of the ban also say lawmakers should consider that the U.S., despite being the world’s No. 1 oil producer, still imports some of its supply in order to meet high demand. Changing the law to ease exports could come back to bite the U.S. if global energy markets shift, said Commander Kirk Lippold, president of the consulting firm Lippold Strategies, who also served 26 years in the Navy. “The day may come when the U.S. is no longer overly dependent on oil imports, and we may be in a position to change our crude oil export policy. But for the sake of national security, that day is not today,” he told the House subcommittee Thursday. Some House Democrats say lifting the ban will lead directly to the production of more fossil fuels, thereby accelerating climate change and destroying the planet. Indeed, the GAO review did say that increased crude production “may pose risks to the quality and quantity of surface groundwater sources; increase greenhouse gas and other emissions; and increase the risk of spills from crude oil transportation.” “What are the environmental and climate impacts of lifting the export ban? We have to choose the cleanest and most sustainable path forward,” said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., New Jersey Democrat and his party’s ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Those in charge of safety on local rivers and lakes have strengthened their plea for people to learn to swim or put on a life jacket before heading into the open water, after a teenage boy and a young man drowned in Sonoma County waterways on the Fourth of July. Marquette Gross, 14, died after falling off an inflatable water toy being towed across Lake Sonoma on the same day 20-year-old Jose Campos-Campos perished in the Russian River near Monte Rio Beach. Neither knew how to swim and neither was wearing a life jacket, officials have said. “If you can’t swim, wear a flotation device. It’s so simple,” said an exasperated-sounding Steve Baxman, chief of the Monte Rio Fire Department. He’s responded to numerous drownings on the Russian River over the years and helped save many others from the same fate. “I wish it wouldn’t happen. These people are too young to be dying.” As he and others were out scouring the river near Monte Rio Beach for Campos last Saturday, they assisted in the rescue of three other near-drowning victims, he said. And there are many other close calls each year that go unnoticed, said David Robinson of Sonoma County Regional Parks, which in 2013 created a river safety patrol whose three-person team also has prevented many drownings. Baxman, Robinson and officials with the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake Sonoma say much already is being done to prevent such tragedies, but that more work is needed, including expanding swim class offerings and overcoming a perception of life vests as uncool and unmanly so that more teenage boys and men will wear them. Baxman sits on the board of the Monte Rio Recreation and Park District, which oversees the beach where Campos accessed the water before he drowned. While signs there warn of river hazards, not everyone reads them, he said. Board members want to offer river swim lessons so people can learn the specific challenges of swimming in moving water. But they have struggled to find swim instructors, he said. “If we get instructors it will happen this summer,” he said. For now, some of the nearest swim lessons to the Russian River are provided at Ives Pool in Sebastopol. It’s one of the many locations around the county a bilingual swim program called Vamos a Nadar, or Let’s Go Swimming, is offered. Organized now by Sonoma County Regional Parks, Vamos a Nadar was developed more than a decade ago by a county water safety coalition created in response to a spike in drownings on the Russian River between 2001 and 2003. About 75 percent of the 21 who died in that short period were Latino, prompting the creation of lessons in both English and Spanish. Parents must accompany their children to the one-day program, which provides an introduction to water safety and swimming. Kids go home with a voucher for steeply discounted swim lessons. comments powered by Disqus",

Parents must accompany their children to the one-day program, which provides an introduction to water safety and swimming. Kids go home with a voucher for steeply discounted swim lessons. As of last year, parents can also return for adult swim lessons at Ives Pool, pool manager Ricardo Freitas said. Donors Chris and Virginia Anderegg have provided scholarships for adults who otherwise couldn’t afford the lessons, funding the classes for 11 of about 15 people so far this summer. The pool also provides swim lessons to every Sebastopol and Graton second-grader each spring through a collaboration with the Sebastopol Rotary Club. “It’s very sad to me to see a kid, 14 years old, and a man in his twenties die because they don’t know how to swim,” Freitas said. “It’s on my heart to teach the most people we can.” The efforts appear to be working: Just one person drowned in the Russian River each year from 2009 to 2011, compared to five in 2003, according to data from the Sonoma County Regional Parks department. But in 2012, the county saw another spike in river drownings. The people who died were either too old to participate in Vamos a Nadar or were from outside the county, Robinson said. Recognizing the need to reach people on the river who might be from out of town and without access to local swim lessons, county parks in 2013 created the Russian River Water Safety Patrol, where a park ranger and two open-water lifeguards are stationed at popular county beaches to educate the public about water safety. Robinson said many underestimate the river’s danger, unaware of how strong the current can be or that ankle-deep water can suddenly drop off into a 12-foot hole. Part of the safety patrol’s job is to educate people about those holes and how they change from year to year. And both the county parks department and the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake Sonoma have set their sights on getting life jackets into the hands of as many people as possible. Starting this month, Sonoma County Regional Parks brought on bilingual interns to distribute the vests at popular county beaches Thursday through Monday. Part of their challenge is finding new donors so they can buy enough life vests to meet demand, Robinson said. On July Fourth, they ran out by noon after passing out about 400. But it’s not a matter of simply providing life jackets: They must also overcome cultural resistance to wearing them. State law requires that any water-going vessel must be equipped with a life vest for each person on board; additionally those under 13 must be wearing a properly fitted life jacket, said Mike Dillabough, chief of operations and readiness for the Army Corps of Engineers San Francisco district. However, there are no laws requiring swimmers of any age to wear them, he said. “What we’ve found out is that across the nation, mothers are generally pretty good at this stuff, at wearing their own and getting their kids to wear (life jackets),” Dillabough said. “But teenage boys and men tend not to wear them.” He says the Army Corps has studied making life vests mandatory but found that doing so was not particularly effective. Instead they’re trying to get people to don them voluntarily. “That’s where you wonder how we can do better,” he said. “We’re trying to make the safety message more interesting.” Efforts include stationing “trees” of free life vests at every public access point on Lake Sonoma. On busy weekends like July 4, rangers come by frequently to restock and offer vests to those without them, he said. Bins where the vests can be returned are provided. Free life vests were also available at the private marina where 14-year-old Marquette Gross’s family was visiting, he said. The Army Corps of Engineers is developing a new advertising campaign that speaks to teenage boys and men and tries to make wearing a life jacket seem tough. Already, a sign near a stand of free vests at Yorty Creek Recreation Area shows Navy Seals crawling on a beach and says, “The toughest guys in the world wear life jackets!” At the Russian River, Robinson said concerted efforts to get children to wear life vests have begun to rub off on adults who see their kids having fun with them. “It’s kind of the theme of our beaches,” he said. “Peer pressure in a really positive way: ‘You wear a life jacket, I wear a life jacket.’” Staff Writer Jamie Hansen blogs about education at extracredit.blogs.pressdemocrat.com.

    "DiffbotBody": "Raising a child is a challenge, and it’s exponentially harder when you’re doing it solo. Just ask Bay Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer and mother of three boys. In her book, “Bay and Her Boys: Unexpected Lessons I Learned as a (Single) Mom,” she writes about bringing up kids alone after her husband left when she was pregnant with their third child. Here, she offers parenting tips. They’re geared for single moms, but they’re equally applicable to two-parent families… So much is written and spoken that suggests single parents can’t succeed. Our children, they tell us, are more likely to be low achievers, suffer depression, abuse drugs and alcohol, be sexually promiscuous and drop out of school. There is more, but you get the point. The statistics are disturbing. But numbers don’t tell our story. We do. We are moms. We make the difference for our kids – we give them what they need to defy these odds. We write the story of our families and we do it with our lives. Single moms can succeed – and you must. It’s the most important job you’ll ever do, so put your heart, mind, and soul into it and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it. For the sake of your kids, reach deep inside yourself and find the strength, courage and tenacity to be the mom they need. The first step is to accept all the responsibility – and to hold yourself accountable to the task. Then give it everything you have.

    "LabBody": "Raising a child is a challenge, and it’s exponentially harder when you’re doing it solo. Just ask Bay Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer and mother of three boys. In her book, “Bay and Her Boys: Unexpected Lessons I Learned as a (Single) Mom,” she writes about bringing up kids alone after her husband left when she was pregnant with their third child. Here, she offers parenting tips. They’re geared for single moms, but they’re equally applicable to two-parent families… So much is written and spoken that suggests single parents can’t succeed. Our children, they tell us, are more likely to be low achievers, suffer depression, abuse drugs and alcohol, be sexually promiscuous and drop out of school. There is more, but you get the point. The statistics are disturbing. But numbers don’t tell our story. We do. We are moms. We make the difference for our kids – we give them what they need to defy these odds. We write the story of our families and we do it with our lives. Single moms can succeed – and you must. It’s the most important job you’ll ever do, so put your heart, mind, and soul into it and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it. For the sake of your kids, reach deep inside yourself and find the strength, courage and tenacity to be the mom they need. The first step is to accept all the responsibility – and to hold yourself accountable to the task. Then give it everything you have. Change your life and make whatever sacrifices are needed to put your kids first in your life. I have eight rules for single moms. They work for all parents, but when you’re raising kids on your own, there’s no getting around any one of them. Every rule is essential. So commit yourself to the course, the whole course, and put your kids on the path to becoming the men and women they were meant to be. Rule #1: Take Charge It doesn’t matter how you got here, how traumatic the trip has been, or how discouraged you are. What matters is that you are now a single mom. Walk away from that other life and leave the baggage behind. Throw yourself into the world of single parenting. It’s going to take every bit of your strength, energy and time to be the parent your kids need. Take charge of your life, so you can take charge of theirs. Their lives hinge on you getting it together. Yes, the responsibility is enormous, as is the challenge. But you can do it. Believe in yourself. Be strong. Be proud. Rule #2: Let Their Dad Be Their DadGive your kids every opportunity to have a close and healthy relationship with their father. It is unequivocally one of the most important things you can do for them. Kids know instinctively that their dad belongs in their life, and they desperately want him there. What’s more – they need him there. No matter what you think of him, do what is right for your kids. Never bad-mouth their dad. Don’t tell them anything that would make them think less of him or feel bad about him. But do tell them good things about him so they are comfortable openly loving him in their own home. Then do all in your power to see that they spend time with him. Right behind time with you, it’s the greatest gift you can give them. Ancillary to Rule #2: Compensate for the Lack of a Dad in the Home Kids learn so much and develop so well when they are raised in a loving two-parent family. You can’t give your children that – not now – but you can find good two-parent families and strong male role models and make them part of your kid’s world. Through their example these friends can give your children an understanding and appreciation of the indispensable role of husband and father – and teach them priceless lessons that come with this knowledge. Rule #3: Put Your Kids FirstHere’s the bottom line to raising kids as a single mom: The kids need you – your time, your energy, your heart, your guidance, your understanding, your discipline – they need all of you. Just being nearby doesn’t cut it. They have to know that they are the center of your world, that they can lean on you for strength, that you will never let them down. That kind of trust requires constant sacrifice. Forget about blocks of time for yourself and high-powered jobs; forget about dating and romantic getaways. Spend your evenings and weekends with your kids. Give them a deep sense of belonging that comes with being part of a strong family. Do whatever it takes to put your kids first in your life. Then keep them there. Rule #4: Strip Parenting Down to the Basics You’re one person with the job of two. It’s not easy, but you can do it. Strip parenting down to the basics. It’s the only way to know for certain that you’re focusing your time and energy on the important stuff. Cut expectations down to size. Throw overboard the high, unrealistic ideals of the past. Keep only what matters. Simplify, prioritize and chop until you find the right balance for your family. Scrap the nonessentials and give your kids what they need the most – time with you. Rule #5: Give Your Kids a Home to LoveThe home you give your kids is as important to them as the air they breathe and the food they eat. It needs be like a giant security blanket wrapped tightly around them, providing them with a powerful sense of belonging and a guaranteed refuge from the outside world. For kids to thrive, their home has to be where they feel the comfort and confidence that comes with being part of something bigger than themselves. They learn their home isn’t just where they live – it’s where they belong because it’s where their family lives. Give your kids a home to love – a family-centered, magical place where they live together with you, talking and laughing, playing and sharing, loving and caring. Put televisions, computers and game systems in a family room. Drive your kids out of their bedrooms and into family space. Time together is what makes families, and this happens in the home. It’s your job to see it happens in yours. Rule #6: Be Their Parent, Not Their Friend – Set Rules and Enforce Them Single moms have to establish – and enforce – rules. You can’t avoid either step. One doesn’t work without the other. Your kids will have plenty of friends in their lifetime, but only one mom. You need to be their parent – friend doesn’t cut it. Expectations and limits – and enforcement – are vital to your kids. Simply talking to them is totally inadequate. In fact, it’s nothing but a cop-out. Your kids need absolutes from you, not chit-chat. Give them clearly defined rules, explain the driving principles behind them, and tell them that as a member of your family they’re expected to live by those rules. Then enforce them and never stop. Good parenting requires consistent and fair enforcement of established rules; single parenting demands it. If you want your kids to succeed, you have to be relentless when it comes to keeping them in line. With rules, kids thrive; without them they get lost. Rule #7: Establish Family Traditions – Make Time With Your Kids’ Routine in Your HomeFamily traditions are the most powerful tools in your possession. They ground your kids and give their lives structure. Your children see and feel a strong, undeniable attachment to their family, which creates within them an invaluable sense of belonging. Traditions establish a familiar and special world for your kids. It’s what they do and who they are. They grow comfortable with the routine and secure in their roles. The traditions you choose for your family will define the culture in which your kids are raised, give direction to their lives and leave them with precious memories that will last a lifetime. As one single mom to another: do right by your kids – eat with them, go to church with them and establish other family traditions that put you together with your kids for quality time every single day. Then watch the magic flow. Rule #8: Love Being Your Kids’ Mom As a single mom, appreciate what you have – kids who love you, a home full of family, years packed with great memories. It’s a good life, so live it right and enjoy it to its fullest. Let your kids see how much you love your life with them. Let them know how grateful you are to be their mom, how proud you are to call them your own. Every day look for the joy of being their mom. You’ll find it in their smiles and in the tears you wipe away, in their funny expressions and in their hugs and kisses. You’ll feel the joy when they wake and when they sleep, when they struggle and when they succeed. And it will overwhelm you when they turn and say, “I love you.” Raising kids alone is enormously challenging – and at times brutally difficult. But it’s the most amazing job you’ll ever have – and the most crucial. There is no greater accomplishment in life than being a good parent. So be the mom your kids need. Nothing will fill your heart, your home, or your life with more joy.Adapted from \"Bay and Her Boys: Unexpected Lessons I Learned as a (Single) Mom\" by Bay Buchanan.

    "DiffbotBody": "“Journalist” George Stephanopoulos, the baby-faced chief anchor of ABC “News,” misled the public about his ties to the Clintons. His failure to disclose his recent donation of $75,000 to the Clinton Crime Foundation brings into further question the credibility of what is considered news in the mainstream media. Comment “Journalist” George Stephanopoulos, the baby-faced chief anchor of ABC “News,” misled the public about his ties to the Clintons. His failure to disclose his recent donation of $75,000 to the Clinton Crime Foundation brings into further question the credibility of what is considered news in the mainstream media. In reality, 95% of those pretending to be independent journalists “reporting the news” are nothing more than politically driven, left- wing operatives with agendas. From NBC’s anchor, “Lyin’ Brian” Williams to Dan Rather of CBS (who made up phony documents to hurt George W. Bush), all major media stations have issues. Uber-liberal Keith Olbermann has been terminated from KCBS, ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC Sports and Current TV. Olbermann has been fired more times than George Zimmerman’s gun. The credibility of these male anchors is so low that TV executives are checking to see if Barbara Walters or Larry King is still alive. The last solo male anchor that I liked was Osama bin Laden at his Navy SEAL burial at sea. What made Stephanopoulos’ sneaky non-disclosure so egregious is that he angrily grilled Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer on his Sunday show, ABC This Week. “This Weak” would be a better name for the program — and for his apology. Clinton Cash, the book by Peter Schweizer, laid out the case that the Clintons received money from nefarious international donors in return for political favors while Hillary was Secretary of State. He found a “troubling pattern” of Clinton Crime Foundation donors being rewarded with lucrative contracts in foreign countries. The Clintons live in New York, where no one sees this as a problem. The Clinton camp (a camp you really should not send your kids to) has been actively trying to nuance the story through its surrogates. They say their foundation didn’t receive money until after they had helped the donor. So the money is not a bribe because it comes after the service; it’s really more like tips. And donors can write the “donations/tips” off their taxes. Write offs are important to Democrats with the high taxes they like. In fact, Obama seems to have written off his entire second term. Since leaving office, Bill and his accessory, Hillary, have amassed a net worth of $140 million. In 2014 alone, they made $25 million for 104 speeches. Just imagine how rich they would be if they were not “share the wealth” Democrats. Stephanopoulos makes $8 million a year. When these rich libs speak of the problems besetting middle-class Americans, it’s pure speculation. According to The Federalist, only 15% of the Clinton Foundation take was donated to pragmatic programs. $25 million went to fund travel and $110 million to salaries. An astounding $290 million, 60% of all money raised, was classified as “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation is so corrupt that Charity Navigator won’t rate it since they can’t understand it. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

Even Stephanopoulos’ explanation, which reads in part “Though I made them [his donations] strictly to support work done to stop the spread of AIDS, help children and protect the environment in poor countries, I should have gone the extra mile to avoid even the appearance of a conflict” is a self-serving, weaselly statement. He is saying, “So sorry I am such a good guy.” Remember, the whole pretense of the scam propagated on us by liberals is that their intentions are noble and, therefore, they are noble — no matter the lies. Stephanopoulos worked as Clinton’s White House Communications Director, so he is good at hiding the truth. He was so adept at lying that his Secret Service code name was “Hillary.” Giving the Clintons the checkbook of a foundation is like giving your PIN to a Nigerian prince based on an email he sent you. Trusting ideologue news anchors to give you the facts on such political matters is also naïve. The media and non-profits are the revolving door job market for ex-Democrats, giving them employment while most Republicans find work as presidential candidates. The media will circle the wagons to protect Democrat Stephanopoulos. There is a club there, and it is all about “the cause.” Leaving the media’s leftist cabal is harder than leaving the Church of Scientology.

    "DiffbotBody": "Update July 17th - Microsoft has now updated its lifecycle support page to list Windows 10. It states the end of Mainstream Support as October 13, 2020 and the end of Extended Support (security) as October 14, 2025. This is great news and I think these time periods are fair and inline with previous Windows releases. Windows 10 is famously ‘free’, but Microsoft has been worryingly silent about just how free it really is. Now, only 17 days before release, leaks suggest ‘free’ Windows 10 might not be a good deal at all… The news comes from ComputerWorld which attained Microsoft internal slides that strongly suggest many Windows 10 owners will have to start paying to receive updates within two years. The key lines ComputerWorld discovered are: “Revenue allocated is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades are expected to be provided by estimated device life…. [The estimated device life] can range from two to four years.” ‘Device life’ is the key phrase here. Microsoft has already stated revenue earned from Windows 10 must be deferred because of the free upgrade model (cash isn’t taken upfront), but it repeatedly stressed Windows 10 owners can expect to get free updates for the “supported lifetime of the device”. The problem is Microsoft hadn’t defined how long the ‘supported lifetime of the device’ will be and now we see it: “two to four years”. Edit: I am in ongoing communication with Microsoft and it states the slides in question are from a financial analyst briefing which did not focus on the servicing model. I have asked for clarification of the terms used in these slides including “supported lifetime of the device” but have been told Microsoft is “not yet sharing full details of the service model”. With Windows 10 going on sale in just over two weeks I have asked Microsoft to reconsider and will update if it does. Is This A Two Year Con? So what does “two to four years” mean? Is it two or is it four? In light of no official clarification from Microsoft the slides can help – if not result in formal conclusions. In a change of language Microsoft states device lifetime will be determined by “customer type” whereas it had previously stated it would be determined by “form factor”. This may prove crucial. For example ‘Form factor’ should mean a phone where two years of support isn’t great, but survivable and similarly four years support for a tablet or PC which isn’t great but it is survivable. But defining by ‘customer type’ invokes Microsoft’s two main customer licence types: Home (average consumer) and Professional (prosumer/business). By this new definition “two to four years” would mean two years free support for Windows 10 Home users regardless of their device type and up to four years free support for Windows 10 Pro users regardless of their device type. Two years free support on a PC is garbage. It would see Windows 10 free support expire in 2017 while Windows 7 and Windows 8 free support doesn’t expire until January 2020 and 2023 respectively. Could this really happen? Again without Microsoft spelling it out we can’t say. What’s more it also opens up an even bigger question: what follows the expiry of free support? There are several ways of looking at this. Most charitably Microsoft could release ‘Windows 10.1’ and then kickstart another two years of free support, the same again for ‘Windows 10.2’ and so on which pushes users to keep updating. It’s a nice thought, but Microsoft already has a strict threat in place for those who lag behind. The other perspective returns us to the “deferred revenue” Microsoft says it will encounter with Windows 10. The interesting part is Microsoft claims the money it loses from the free upgrades will be made up within three years. If there’s a free upgrade plus two years of free support (for all consumers) then the introduction of subscription based charging, this suddenly fits together and angry conspiracy theories run wild. What To Believe So what’s the answer? Frustratingly, infuriatingly, mystifyingly we have no way of knowing because – even with just three weeks to go before launch – Microsoft’s controlled drip feed of Windows 10 information shows no sign of speeding up. Yes it’s mad. Microsoft is releasing arguably the most important version of Windows in its history this month and we don’t know how long it will be supported or what future costs we will be charged after this unknown period. Instead Microsoft simply keeps shouting: “It’s Free! It’s Free! It’s Free!*” (*for the lifetime of the device – and we won’t define ‘lifetime’ or what happens after that) This sucks. It sucks because there could be a perfectly good explanation but Microsoft is not being open about it. It sucks because upgrading Windows versions is not an easy task for many users and even more of a hassle to downgrade if users find they’ve been shortchanged. And it really sucks for those who buy a new Windows 10 PC and are locked into the unknown. But most tragically it sucks because Windows 10 is actually a great OS. Throughout my participation in the Windows Insider testers program it has been the fastest, most stable series of Windows betas I’ve used, but Microsoft may be about to hamstring the whole thing. Promising ‘Free Windows 10′ then delivering ’Freemium-Windows-10-Get-Your-Credit-Cards-Out-In-Two-Years’ would be a disaster and right now Microsoft’s ongoing silence about how everything works feels ever more suspicious. Ultimately at this stage the company is either playing us or its naivety is now bordering on idiotic. It’s a crazy situation to be in where we all have to hope and pray it is the latter… ___ Hello Mr. Kelly, It appears my previous post may have been accidentally deleted. I’ll try again. 1. It’s concerning that you didn’t attempt to speak to Microsoft about this. As you are making claims about their behavior, their opinion would likely be a strong addition to your article’s credibility. 2. “It’s Free! …. *” (*for the lifetime of the device – and we won’t define ‘lifetime’ or what happens after that) The location of your text, directly above a truncated image of the Windows 10 upgrade details, implies that they are Microsoft’s words, but they are not. If you go to the windows 10 update details you can read them and see that there is no mention of the lifetime of the device anywhere. For your reader’s convenience, the update details are located here, towards the bottom of the page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/features From Microsoft: “Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.” Notice the lack of the asterisk. 3. I’m curious as to what wording in the slides “strongly suggests” many windows 10 owners will start paying to receive updates? I read the slides and saw nothing. Please provide evidence of this strong suggestion with a direct excerpt. It seems very unlikely that Microsoft would claim it’s free only to then start charging for it and deal with the insane PR failure that would bring. While I’m not a business major or an accountant, I would take a position contrary to yours. I interpret the slides as warning to investors or other stakeholders that all the revenue from purchases of Windows 10 licenses will not be recognized as income in the year that the purchase was made. In slide 5, it clearly shows that with the Window 10 model there will be unearned revenue which gets passed on to the following year. It doesn’t show zero revenue for 2 years, at which point revenue suddenly starts pouring in from the masses it has duped into paying for security updates it could have gotten for free with the product they already had. Much like when a business purchases a building, it defers the purchase price across the expected useful life of the building. That doesn’t mean when that period of time expires, the building is demolished and the business must pay for a new one to replace it. Counter to point 3 above, it doesn’t even remotely suggest that users will start paying for their updates after the expected lifetime of the device has passed. This “expected lifetime of the device” is obviously for Microsoft’s internal bookkeeping for financial statements; it is when Microsoft estimates certain “customer types” will have acquired a new piece of hardware which comes with a newly purchased OEM license, thus injecting a new set of Windows 10 revenue into the income deferral process. Finally, months ago Rafe Needleman from Yahoo spoke with a Microsoft representative and cleared this up. The result? If you aren’t in the special case of an enterprise or running windows 10 on virtual machines: It’s Free! It’s Free! It’s Free! … without an asterisk. I look forward to more explanation of your points.",

He’s Nike’s golden boy, the current face of the sport, and a four-time majors winner. Not since the glory days of Tiger Woods has there been a player on tour who you expect to be at the top of the leaderboard during each and every event. But that’s who McIlroy’s become. But even with all the praise and accolades, success and rankings, this European is not the best golfer on the planet. Not right now, anyway. That honor belongs to a 21-year-old from Texas who continues to play with a composure well beyond his years. A kid who, regardless of the stage or conditions, manages to block out the noise, stay within himself, and get it done. And with his victory on Sunday at the 2015 U.S. Open — at Chambers Bay — there shouldn’t be any doubt that at this moment in time, is the top golfer in the world. Anyone who refutes this statement hasn’t been watching lately. Because what this young man has done so far this season, is beyond impressive. It’s historic. There’s an argument to be made that Spieth didn’t win this major, so much as Dustin Johnson gave it away. After all, if Johnson doesn’t three-put on 18, then the kid is never in a position to sink a birder for the win. But don’t forget there was a moment — after grabbing a three-stroke lead following a birdie on 16 — when it appeared this tournament was Spieth’s for the taking. However, once he double-bogeyed the next hole, all bets were off. Yet, he never got frazzled; never lost his cool. He regrouped. And now finds himself the owner of two major championships before his 22nd birthday. “I’m still in shock,” Spieth said with the gleaming U.S. Open trophy at his side. “I’ve never experienced a feeling like this. It was a very intense back nine.” Intense, sure. That still didn’t stop Spieth from shooting a 1-under 69 in the final round, finishing with a 5-under 275 for the tournament, and capturing his second straight major this season. What Spieth did at Augusta National was inspiring. What he did at the U.S. Open was courageous. The conditions at Chambers Bay were far from ideal; especially on the greens. He overcame all that to become the youngest player in history to win the Masters and the U.S. Open in the same year. Now he’s halfway home to winning the Grand Slam. Some even believe he has the chops to do it. Four majors in one year. Could you imagine that? It’s never been done before. It’s seems improbable to think that anyone could actually do it. But Spieth has proved himself more than capable. It’s hard to bet against a guy like that. “Jordan is good enough to win the Grand Slam,” USGA executive director Mike Davis told ESPN.com. “Somebody who can win on a course like this and the Masters, these are just two different animals. So he’s enough of a shot-maker. And the thing about Jordan is, when you watch him, he doesn’t do anything spectacular. You look at his entire game and say, ‘He’s not one of the best drivers, he’s not one of the best putters, but he does everything really well.’ “And he’s an incredible thinker … Think about what he went through standing on the 18th tee, having a 3-shot lead and doing what he did [on 17] and then hearing the roar from Dustin’s group. And now all of a sudden he goes, ‘I’ve got a 3-shot lead, too, I’m tied.’ Think about the emotions going through it. The chances of him winning [the Grand Slam], the odds are not great. But he is absolutely capable of it.” We probably shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves. Not since Ben Hogan in 1953 has a player won the first three consecutive majors during the same year. Plus, Spieth can’t go for four in a row if he doesn’t take home The Open Championship at St. Andrews. Therefore, we’ll just have to wait and see if the 21-year-old can make that happen. Right now, though, we should savor the moment. You have to believe that’s what Jordan Spieth is doing. After all, it’s not every day you become the best golfer in the world.

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment Advocates for Cambridge’s homeless all agree on one thing: they can’t solve the problem on their own. The city held two community-wide meetings last week to get the public’s input on the most critical issues facing the homeless population. One of the main concerns of the second meeting held Thursday, June 25, was how to service those in need with the city’s constraints in affordable housing, and whether the city needs to look elsewhere. “We need to approach all of this within the context of where we live and work; there is an incredible affordable housing crisis,” said Rise Mednick, executive director of Transition House, a Cambridge nonprofit that offers housing and support to those overcoming domestic violence. “Part of the reason people are homeless is cause they can’t afford a place to live, not just in Cambridge, but Greater Boston. If we as a culture cannot manage to create affordable housing and sustain that affordable housing, there will be increasing homelessness. We have an opportunity to look at this in a holistic way.” Cambridge is known for its array of services for the homeless, which attendees acknowledged may play a part in such a large homeless population in the city. Easy access through public transportation is also a factor, they said. “We provide a lot of services in Cambridge. There’s a belief that we have more homeless cause we offer more services,” said George Metzger, a local architect. “The solution may not be 6 square miles; it may be trying to solve the problem in a greater way.” Metzger and others mentioned the need to work with other communities in the area that may not offer their own services, but have more housing potential. Participants in Thursday’s meeting tried to whittle down the most important issues the city needs to focus on during its homelessness planning in the coming months. A Steering Committee — made up of 15 local advocates representing a range of community organizations from the Cambridge Police and Development Department to CASPAR and Transition House — is leading the effort, along with help from Larry Oaks, director of Corporation for Supportive Housing, a national nonprofit that offers guidance on housing solutions. The brainstorming, which began in May, will culminate during a weeklong planning process the city is calling Charrette Week, Sept. 15-18, named after the charrette process, which means intense planning, according to Oaks. Oaks has participated in more than 25 charrettes across the country. During last Thursday’s meeting, the group discussed eight potential issue areas for the upcoming charrette, including prioritizing people for different interventions; preventing homelessness; serving people who use emergency services frequently; housing first-service models; services in housing to prevent returns to homelessness; employment and income strategies for homeless individuals and families; working with landlords and property management companies; and strategies for increasing investment.

When planning what sort of services are important, some said it was critical to gather more concrete data on how many homeless people are in the city and how much it would cost per person to get them off the street. “We need finely-tuned data, so we know how to prioritize and know which resources are appropriate,” said Metzger. “If some homelessness occurs because they’re getting priced out, which is related to development, then it seems fair to say, it costs $300 [for example] to support someone in the community. …There’s a cost. …We need to figure out what homelessness can be eliminated and how do we put the right resources to eliminate that.” Metzger said it wasn’t a one-size-fits-all solution since people enter homelessness for different reasons. To know what those solutions are, he believes the city must figure out which types of homelessness are the most prevalent in the city. Oaks said the city annually conducts a “point-in-time count” which assesses how many homeless people are in Cambridge at a given time. Liz Mengers of the Department of Human Service Programs said the count is broken down geographically and is posted on the city’s website. The last test was conducted in February, in the midst of a brutal winter, and there were 206 individuals in emergency shelters, 32 outdoors and 100 in transitional housing. There were also 126 homeless families, 61 of whom were in transitional housing and 65 in emergency shelters. (Click here to read the full report.) “Even if we housed those 300 people permanently, there will be another set replacing them,” Mengers said. “I think being in metro Boston, Quincy and other communities on the Red Line, resource-rich communities in accessible areas … people who are here fall into homelessness.” Need for more detox options. During the meeting, Bruce Sullivan, a once-homeless man who currently lives in Caritas Communities’ Central Housing inside the YMCA at 820 Mass. Ave., said he believes the city should offer more detox programs. “With all the services Massachusetts has … I don’t understand why all these people are on the streets,” said Sullivan, a former substance abuser. “What I’ve seen, and I’ve been in recovery since 1992, the young kids chose to be homeless, they’re thrown out of the house. It boils down to a lot of it is drug addiction. I think you need the detoxes; I know I relied on them.” “Being addicted should not be synonymous with being homeless,” said Sandler. Oaks added that the charrette should look into what sort of barriers prohibit the homeless from getting housing. “The idea is to get them into housing as soon as possible and then wrap them in services so they can stop that cycle,” he said. Shelly Chevalier, planning and development manager at the Department of Human Service Programs, said the department will continue to reach out to the public throughout the planning process. “This is a really challenging issue, so we get it that we have to really try to do this differently,” she said. “What this process is about is pushing beyond what we know. That requires us, very much, reaching out and talking to folks about what their current experiences are.” For information, visit cambridgecharrette.yolasite.com.

I'm fully ensconced just 10 minutes' stroll from London Bridge and with brilliant views of the city's new Lego skyline: the Shard, the Walkie-Talkie, the Cheese Grater and the Gherkin (and now hotly anticipating the Botox Syringe and the Barclays Private Bank Safe Key). The local newsagent knows me, the charcuterie around the corner knows me and the bartenders certainly know me. I'm practically a native. Yet I still can't summon any energy.

Buildings, along with train carriages, have provided the canvas for graffiti artists since the practice of scribbling over someone else's property took off in its modern form in New York City in the 1960s. Now, graffiti-covered trains are adorning buildings. Those who see graffiti as a blight already probably avert their eyes from the letter-laden walls of Melbourne's gritty inner-north. In Collingwood's Easey Street they're advised to also avoid looking up. A new five-storey building, modelled on a train platform, features three retired Hitachi electric engine cars perched on its roof gutted to create habitable space. It's a permanent marker of graffiti's role in Melbourne's evolving history and shows how far graffiti has come by giving it a physical form. \"It's part of the landscape now,\" says Theo Tzaros, one of three partners in the $8-million End to End building. \"[Graffiti]'s fused with architecture.\" Like it or hate it, it's certainly a feature of Melbourne, where tourists wander with smartphones among the city's many graffitied laneways. Graffiti works by big-name street artists can pull huge sums – auction house Sotheby's sold UK artist Banksy's Untitled (F--- The Police) in February for £209,000 ($436,000). The scope of the transformation from vandalism to cultural pin-up is personified in developer Tzaros. He's better known by his alter ego, Prowler, a revered figure in Melbourne's graffiti and street art circles.

    "DiffbotBody": "Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has most definitely got people talking over the past few weeks. Truth be told, when it comes to U.S. politics, the media don’t have to look much beyond Trump if they want a story. As most people will know by now, the media feeding frenzy started four weeks ago when property tycoon Trump announced that he intended to seek the GOP’s nomination for another tilt at the presidency. Trump used the announcement that he was seeking the nomination to describe Mexican immigrants as “criminals, drug dealers and rapists.” Trump’s comments obviously stirred up a huge amount of controversy, and his comments have been attacked by many, including some within his own party. Trump, however, has remained unapologetic. Last week, Trump even called for a wall to be built between the U.S. and Mexico to stop immigrants crossing the border illegally. Yesterday, SF Gate compared Trump to Lord Voldemort, saying, “[T]o thinking Republicans who don’t want to go through another circle of hell like the 2012 presidential primary, Trump is He Who Must Not Be Named.” The Huffington Post calls Trump “America’s narcissist in chief” and says that for Trump the word “egomaniac” is an understatement. They point out that “when challenged on the inaccuracy, outrageousness and viciousness of his remarks,” Trump simply attacks those who challenge him, calling them unpatriotic. Trump also claims that he is the only one with the courage to tell the truth. Interviewed by NBC’s Katy Tur on Wednesday, Trump attacked the interviewer, telling her that she “didn’t know what she was talking about” when she confronted Trump with figures that show that undocumented immigrants in America actually have much lower crime rates than natural born American citizens. Earlier this week, Trump announced his plan to deal with the growing problem of Islamic State. Trump’s plan is to bomb “the hell” out of the oil fields in Iraq. Trumps said, “If I win, I would attack those oil sites that are controlled and owned — they are controlled by ISIS, I wouldn’t send many troops because you won’t need ’em by the time I’m done.” Trump’s plan has been described as “deranged” by military analysts according to Politicus USA. Despite his attacks on Mexican people, Trump is convinced that he will win the Hispanic vote. Trump claimed that he had “great relationships” with Mexican people, including his employees. According to ABC News Trump said, “I will win the Hispanic vote. I’m going to get people jobs. Nobody else is going to.” According to the New York Times, Donald Trump is the “Frankenstein monster who is driving the GOP bus.” [Photo by Andrew H.

Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Americans typically celebrate the Fourth of July with family, friends, fireworks, food, and flags. But alas, some people are incapable of swinging with the holiday spirit. Advertisement I’m referring, of course, to the Obama haters. They never take a day off, and they’re constantly off their meds. Their latest freakout occurred last weekend, when the president voiced cheery remarks about Independence Day. Granted, Obama did laud the military (“we are so grateful for their service and for their sacrifice”), he plucked the chords of patriotism (“we honor everyone who continually strives to make this country a better, stronger, more inclusive, and more hopeful place”), and he praised the Founding Fathers (“this is the day when, 239 years ago, our founding patriots declared our independence, proclaiming that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”). But the haters’ heads exploded anyway. Why? Because he didn’t say the word “God.” The right-wing Washington Examiner announced, “Obama omits ‘God’ from Fourth of July address.” An Examiner reader duly tweeted, “Obama omits ‘God’ from Fourth of July address Obama is a secular Muslim with communist leaning.” Elsewhere, the right-wing Infowars website announced, “Obama leaves out ‘God’ from 4th of July weekly address.” An Infowars reader duly tweeted, “Closet Muslim leaves out ‘God’ from 4th of July weekly address.” Others duly re-tweeted and contributed their own scholarship, such as, “The godless little man — Is anyone surprised?” and “This proves he is a muslim” and “Devil only mentions God when damning him.” I could go on. The right-wing Gateway Pundit blog opined, “Who the man is, and what he truly stands for, is beginning to seep out” and a blogger at BizPac Review lamented, “He may as well have said, ‘Tell all your friends you love Obamacare’....I’m beginning to think he does things like this just to tick people off.” But that’s enough troll bilge for one day. Perhaps a few hundred sessions of anger management would help school these people in the benefits of rational thought. The word “Creator,” which Obama referenced in his holiday address, is listed in the dictionary as a synonym for “God.” And last time I checked, Obama concludes virtually every formal address, including the State of the Union, with variations of “may God bless the United States of America.” In fact, Obama recently delivered a formal address in Charleston, eulogizing nine victims of racist domestic terrorism, and if my ears were functioning correctly, I could’ve sworn that I heard him say the G-word. Like, for instance: “Giving all praise and honor to God....Blinded by hatred, (the terrorist) failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood — the power of God’s grace....According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It’s not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God....May God continue to shed His Grace on the United States of America.” Any anger-management candidate with a keyboard can search the transcript and discover that Obama mentioned “God” 17 times. By the way, if the haters have truly convinced themselves that Obama is God-lite, they might want to extend their ire to Thomas Jefferson — because our Fourth of July author was notoriously indifferent about religion in general. For instance, we have this passage he wrote in 1782: “It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty Gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket or breaks my leg.” And this letter he wrote in 1813: “History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance...” And this letter in 1820: “Priests...dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight.” Heck, when he ran for president in 1800, his opponents warned that if he won, he would shutter all the churches. The Fourth of July is a secular holiday and Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence is a secular document. But if the haters prefer to stay fixated on Obama’s G-word omission, perhaps they should play his remarks backward and listen carefully for coded praise of Allah. The task could take a while, but these people seem to have the time. Dick Polman is the national political columnist at NewsWorks/WHYY in Philadelphia. Email him at dickpolman7@gmail.com.",

In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.'

    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "State House Bureau | The Record Print RECORD FILE PHOTO/CHRIS PEDOTA New Jersey won’t pay for Bridget Anne Kelly’s legal bills. That decision followed a months-long fight by her attorney who argued she was being treated differently from other state employees who, like her, all believed it was a traffic study that caused the lane closings at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. The details of the state’s decision and the legal fight with Kelly’s lawyers were made public on Friday after The Record obtained the documents related to Kelly’s request as well as correspondence between her attorney and state officials through an Open Public Records Act request that was filed in May. Kelly, the only state employee fired by Governor Christie in the scandal and later cast as an overly emotional woman in a report by his legal team clearing him, at one point offered to have a retired federal judge hear her side of the story in the effort to have the state pay her legal costs. Kelly has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that she conspired with Christie appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to close the lanes. New Jersey is paying to cover attorney costs for some current and former state employees but has only disclosed the law firms being paid and has declined to release the names of those public workers. Also on Friday, a federal court judge ruled that the law firm that wrote the report that cleared Christie must turn over any handwritten notes or recordings of interviews it conducted with dozens of administration officials during its investigation. Several people in Christie’s administration, including the governor, knew that Kelly, his former deputy chief of staff, was allegedly communicating with Port Authority officials about lane closings as part of a traffic study at the George Washington Bridge before they occurred, her attorney Michael Critchley said in a letter to the director of the state Division of Law, Jeffery Jacobson, on May 19, 2014. GWB scandal archive: Click here to read all of The Record's past coverage Critchley implied in that letter that Kelly believed at the time that the lane closings were part of a legitimate traffic study and said the communications with the Port Authority were part of her job. Federal officials now allege that there was no traffic study and that claims of a study was a cover up for an act of political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. Christie fired Kelly in January 2014 in the wake of the lane-closing scandal. She first asked the state to pay for her legal bills a month after losing her job. The state notified Kelly through Critchley on May 22 — more than 15 months after she first asked — that it was denying her request, citing the federal grand jury indictment against her, a civil lawsuit related to the lane closings and the plea agreement entered by the former Port Authority employee David Wildstein, among other documents. “This office has determined that it is more probable than not that Ms. Kelly acted or failed to act based on actual fraud, willful misconduct or actual malice,” Jacobson wrote in five-page letter denying Kelly’s request. The letter also said the state had concluded that Kelly acted outside the scope of her job as a deputy chief staff. Critchley said on Friday that he plans to revisit having Kelly’s legal bills paid for by the state once she is cleared of federal criminal charges. Just over a week before the state denied her request, Critchley offered to have Kelly sit with a retired federal judge of the state’s choosing to settle the dispute over her legal bills. The state Attorney General’s Office had been requesting that Kelly meet with it to share her side of the story. In a May 13 email, Critchley proposed that the state retain a retired federal judge because he had concerns the state Department of Law and Public Safety and the Attorney General’s Office “have numerous actual and potential conflicts of interest.” Critchley said on Friday that he had concerns that the state was citing as fact the report compiled by the team of attorneys Christie hired to investigate his office. Their findings largely blamed Kelly and Wildstein for the lane closings. They cited her now infamous email to Wildstein, “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee” and portrayed Kelly as being overly emotional. “In my judgment, and I could be wrong, I didn’t think they had the institutional courage to render a decision, which by definition would have to reject the underpinnings of the Mastro report,” Critchley said, referring to Randy Mastro, the lead lawyer on the Christie report. Critchley said he suggested a retired federal judge because Kelly is facing federal charges and he thought such a person could offer an unbiased view of whether the state should pay her legal bills. Before denying Kelly’s request, the state Attorney General’s Office went back and forth with Critchley for more than a year in an effort to have her personally meet with the Attorney General’s Office to provide additional information. Critchley argued that Kelly was being held to a different standard than other current and former employees who were granted legal fees and questioned why his client was being subjected to such a process. Jacobson, in an email dated July 29, 2014, told Critchley he couldn’t comment on discussions with other clients but said that Kelly was in a “unique position” in his view. Critchley subsequently met with Assistant Attorney General Kevin Jespersen, who later agreed that anything Kelly told him would fall under attorney-client confidentiality and that he would not disclose any information without her consent. But Critchley also wanted the state to decide simultaneously whether to cover her legal bills in both civil and criminal cases. Jespersen said that the state would consider the civil case first because of a pending suit against her and others related to the lane closings but that it couldn’t immediately decide on whether it would pay for her defense against criminal charges. Critchley wrote in an Oct. 24 email that without those assurances he couldn’t recommend that Kelly speak to the Attorney General’s Office. “This disparate treatment, combined with the state’s arbitrary, unjustified and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to deny Ms. Kelly unemployment benefits to which she was legally entitled to, causes me great concern,” he wrote. “Given the AG’s Office’s refusal to treat Ms. Kelly as it has treated everyone else, I believe it would be irresponsible for Ms. Kelly to divulge all her information on this matter.” Critchley said on Friday that New Jersey initially denied Kelly’s request for unemployment, claiming that she was not a state employee. However, she was able to get the benefits after he contested that decision. “The state’s first position when she applied for unemployment was that she was not a state employee, that she was just working on a particular transaction and the transaction was over,” he said. “We had to appeal it.” ",

The liberal media quickly jumped on the story, making it go viral in an attempt to slander the name of Selleck due to his conservative views. Unfortunately for these liberal haters, however, this story is about to come to an end. According to Daily Mail, Selleck has reached a tentative agreement with the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County, located just north of Los Angeles. The agreement will now go to the agency’s board for approval, and they will be meeting to decide on that next Wednesday. “We’re happy about it,” commented Eric Bergh, the district’s resources manager. “It’s good news.” He added that details of the agreement are confidential. Selleck and his wife of nearly 30 years Jillie Mack were accused of dispatching a white truck to retrieve gallons of water from a valley close to their ranch on 12 occasions in 2013. The water district spent $22,000 on a private investigator to catch the Hollywood couple. This agreement, however, means that this story is now coming to a close, so it’s time for the liberal media to back off and leave the Sellecks alone!",

    "DiffbotBody": "SAADA, YEMEN – Every few miles on a drive north of Yemen's capital, a charred hulk or massive bomb crater blocks the highway – the result of airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition against the Houthi rebels who have taken over much of the country. While most of the destroyed vehicles appear to be tankers and cargo trucks, some are clearly local traffic, like a charred flatbed surrounded by dozens of dead goats. As we speed along the nearly deserted highway, we can hear the occasional roar of jets in the sky. Most of the Houthi checkpoints we pass are abandoned. It makes for nerve-wracking driving. Since March, Houthis have launched attacks on southern Saudi Arabia from the mountainous province of Saada. In May, the Saudis declared the entire province a military target. Leaflets were dropped, telling the area's civilian population of nearly 1 million to flee. An all-out aerial assault ensued. Two reports published last week, by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Saudi Arabia of \"attacks that appeared to violate international humanitarian law\" and \"possible disproportionate or indiscriminate attacks.\" A month later, Saada City is utterly devastated, its main roads lined with shattered buildings. A local activist led us through its deserted old market, where a 30-foot crater sits outside the gate of a damaged 1,200-year-old mosque. The airstrikes targeted homes, shopping malls, cold-storage facilities, car dealerships, restaurants and gas stations. At one pump we were told 17 people were killed and 49 injured while waiting in line to fuel up – a column of blackened cars still stood in a row. According to a UN satellite analysis conducted on May 17, a total of 1,171 structures in Saada have been damaged or destroyed by airstrikes. The situation may be even worse in rural areas near the border. At a hospital in Saada City supported by Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French initials, MSF), a stream of cluster bomb victims arrived from the village of Radha.\"We're just farmers,\" said Saleh Khairan, who had brought in his wounded uncle. In a separate incident, members of the MSF team told me they had recently received ten dead bodies from nearby Sabr, and that five of them had been children. When we traveled to the village, witnesses showed us the names and ages of 51 people they claim were killed in airstrikes on June 3rd — 36 of them were children. \"We don't know why they targeted us,\" said Salem Ali, a resident of Sabr. He surveyed his destroyed village and a Saudi-coalition jet passed overhead. Many of Saudi Arabia's weapons and aircraft were purchased from the U.S. We have encountered remnants of both conventional and cluster bombs likely made in the U.S.A., including BU-97 cluster bomb submunitions, which were transferred to Saudi Arabia by the U.S. in the Nineties. The U.S. has also provided both in-flight refueling and targeting intelligence to bombing missions. As a result, there is a widespread perception among the Yemenis that the American government is equally responsible for the air war. Matthieu Aikins and Sebastiano Tomada recently ran the blockade into Yemen, traveling from Djibouti by boat across the Gulf of Aden. 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",
    "LabBody": "SAADA, YEMEN – Every few miles on a drive north of Yemen's capital, a charred hulk or massive bomb crater blocks the highway – the result of airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition against the Houthi rebels who have taken over much of the country. While most of the destroyed vehicles appear to be tankers and cargo trucks, some are clearly local traffic, like a charred flatbed surrounded by dozens of dead goats. As we speed along the nearly deserted highway, we can hear the occasional roar of jets in the sky. Most of the Houthi checkpoints we pass are abandoned. It makes for nerve-wracking driving. Since March, Houthis have launched attacks on southern Saudi Arabia from the mountainous province of Saada. In May, the Saudis declared the entire province a military target. Leaflets were dropped, telling the area's civilian population of nearly 1 million to flee. An all-out aerial assault ensued. Two reports published last week, by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Saudi Arabia of \"attacks that appeared to violate international humanitarian law\" and \"possible disproportionate or indiscriminate attacks.\" A month later, Saada City is utterly devastated, its main roads lined with shattered buildings. A local activist led us through its deserted old market, where a 30-foot crater sits outside the gate of a damaged 1,200-year-old mosque. The airstrikes targeted homes, shopping malls, cold-storage facilities, car dealerships, restaurants and gas stations. At one pump we were told 17 people were killed and 49 injured while waiting in line to fuel up – a column of blackened cars still stood in a row. According to a UN satellite analysis conducted on May 17, a total of 1,171 structures in Saada have been damaged or destroyed by airstrikes. The situation may be even worse in rural areas near the border. At a hospital in Saada City supported by Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French initials, MSF), a stream of cluster bomb victims arrived from the village of Radha.\"We're just farmers,\" said Saleh Khairan, who had brought in his wounded uncle. In a separate incident, members of the MSF team told me they had recently received ten dead bodies from nearby Sabr, and that five of them had been children. When we traveled to the village, witnesses showed us the names and ages of 51 people they claim were killed in airstrikes on June 3rd — 36 of them were children. \"We don't know why they targeted us,\" said Salem Ali, a resident of Sabr. He surveyed his destroyed village and a Saudi-coalition jet passed overhead. Many of Saudi Arabia's weapons and aircraft were purchased from the U.S. We have encountered remnants of both conventional and cluster bombs likely made in the U.S.A., including BU-97 cluster bomb submunitions, which were transferred to Saudi Arabia by the U.S. in the Nineties. The U.S. has also provided both in-flight refueling and targeting intelligence to bombing missions. As a result, there is a widespread perception among the Yemenis that the American government is equally responsible for the air war. Matthieu Aikins and Sebastiano Tomada recently ran the blockade into Yemen, traveling from Djibouti by boat across the Gulf of Aden.",

    "DiffbotBody": "What’s an Independence Day celebration without fireworks? Turns out a Fourth of July without fireworks, would be a Fourth of July free from extra air pollution. Fireworks displays, as it turns out, significantly increase air pollution. You can smell fireworks in the air, but many people don’t realize that that familiar smell of fireworks is polluting their lungs. A new study, which was featured in the journal Atmospheric Environment, claims that fireworks from Fourth of July celebrations directly cause an average of a 42 percent rise in air pollution. There is a rise in fine particulate matter, called “PM2.5,” in the evening on Independence Day in the United States and on July 5 every year. The particles that the researchers are concerned with are 2.5 micrometer in diameter and smaller, and they are a big health concern, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “Particle pollution — especially fine particles — contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems.” The EPA says that exposure to air pollution from the fine particles, like those released during fireworks displays, increase risks of heart attacks, lung conditions, and stroke. More often, fireworks increase the incidences of irregular heartbeat, increased attacks, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms.

Seidel, of NOAA’s Air Resources Laboratory, explained. “These results will help improve air quality predictions, which currently don’t account for fireworks as a source of air pollution. The study is also another wake-up call for those who may be particularly sensitive to the effects of fine particulate matter.” The EPA doesn’t regulate fireworks, according to Medical News Today, but the EPA does have a 24-hour limit on PM2.5 concentrations higher than 35 mcg per cubic meter. In one monitored fireworks site, the PM2.5 concentration was so bad on the Fourth of July that it was about 370 percent more polluted than normal, far exceeding the tolerable level of air pollution for healthy breathing.

Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

Eldora was born on June 20, 1946 in Stoughton, WI to Ivan Lee and Ruby Mae (Heyen) Shantz. She was raised in Janesville, WI. At an early age, she professed her faith and made a commitment to follow Christ her entire life. After high school graduation, she earned her bachelor's degree in Missionary Nursing from St. Paul Bible College (now Crown College). She returned to Janesville to work as an RN prior to her marriage to Terry Huffman in 1970. Advertisement The next several years were spent in preparation for Eldora and Terry's anticipated missionary ministry overseas with The Christian and Missionary Alliance and their pastorate in Renville, MN. Eldora's calling to overseas ministry was fulfilled in January 1978, when they departed for the Philippines. During their 26 years there, she was involved primarily with numerous translation projects and teaching responsibilities. Following their overseas ministry, Eldora and Terry came to Baxter, MN to pastor Heartland Alliance Church. Eldora renewed her RN license, giving end of life care to her parents and returning to work as a home health care nurse. Prior to her illness, she enjoyed accompanying Terry on his over the road trucking trips. She had many other interests and activities including bird watching, cooking, reading, and in-depth studies of God's word-her lifelong passion.

    "DiffbotBody": "By now, your social media feed will will have shown you a link from the Huffington Post’s new long-form site Highline to the story about former Runaways bassist Jackie Fuchs/Fox being discovered, groomed, and ultimately drugged and raped by the band’s producer/Svengali Kim Fowley in front of a motel roomful of onlookers—allegedly including Fuchs’s bandmates Cherie Currie and Joan Jett—on New Year’s Eve of 1975. Fuchs was 16 years old. Fowley was 36. Click that link. The 6,000-word article, written by former Washington City Paper crime reporter Jason Cherkis, is lurid, graphic, melodramatic, infuriating, and unbearably compelling. Whether or not you care about the Runaways, you should go read it. It’s long, but you won’t notice till it’s over. The following excerpt gives a good indication of how brutal the whole piece is: Fowley invited other guys to have sex with Jackie before removing his own pants and climbing on top of her. “Kim’s fucking someone!” a voice shouted from the door of the motel room to the partygoers outside, calling them in to watch. Arguelles returned to the room to see if this was all a big joke. On the bed, Fowley played to the crowd, gnashing his teeth and growling like a dog as he raped Jackie. He got up at one point to strut around the room before returning to Jackie’s body. “I remember opening my eyes, Kim Fowley was raping me, and there were people watching me,” Jackie says. She looked out from the bed and noticed Currie and Jett staring at her. She says this was her last memory of the night. Jett, through a representative, denied witnessing the event as it has been described here. Her representative referred all further questions to Jackie “as it’s a matter involving her and she can speak for herself.” Though the story is shocking, the worst thing about it is that it isn’t surprising. The Runaways’ iconography was all about their jailbait sexuality, and Fowley’s persona was all about fucking any girl he could get his hands on, the younger the better. And yet the idea that somehow he never interfered with this band of teenage girls that he recruited, produced, styled, controlled, and profited from has persisted for decades—abetted by the official accounts of the women themselves, several books, a sanitized feature film, and, more broadly, the agonizing process by which monstrous acts are subsumed by a collective will not to disrupt the romance we still attach to rock ’n’ roll’s hedonistic glory days. The desire not to examine the past too closely is powerful, but so is the yearning for acknowledgement felt by people who have suffered. This has led to an excruciating, seemingly irreconcilable cul-de-sac of discourse on social media about famous men accused of monstrous acts. The most obvious recent example is Bill Cosby. Fuchs, who has never before told her story publicly (though rumors of it have circulated for years), says she was moved to come forward last fall when one woman after another began to come forward with stories of being drugged and raped by Cosby. Fuchs’s circumstances were slightly different, but the effects of the decades of shame and anguish she felt were not. Kim Fowley was nowhere near as famous or beloved as Bill Cosby, and their public faces could hardly have been less similar. While Cosby cloaked himself as a wholesome, and later self-righteously upright, entertainer, Fowley flaunted his lasciviousness. He made the threat of sexual violence a primary component of his persona. And he was richly rewarded for it by the commercial and journalistic machinery that rewards rock ’n’ roll stars for being outlaws. Though the Cosby-as-rapist revelations surely send a deeper jolt into the American psyche (and though it certainly isn’t a contest), the news about Fowley feels worse—at least today, anyway—because it barely counts as news. Though he always denied ever having abused the Runaways, he typically did so with knowing euphemism (“in my mind, I didn't make love to anybody in the Runaways”) that left the door wide open; the wink lay in legally credible, blatantly implausible phrases like “in my mind” and “make love.” Because of the way things are in the world, he got credit for being clever enough to reap the benefit of the doubt. Not for nothing was his 2013 autobiography entitled Lord of Garbage. As portrayed in the brilliant rock journalist Evelyn McDonnell’s book Queens of Noise: The Real Story of the Runaways, Kim Fowley was a guy who always knew exactly what he was getting away with. When Fowley died in January, he was mostly celebrated as an American original whose darker tendencies were generally subsumed by his undeniable creative energy and charismatic eccentricity. (McDonnell’s obit was a bit more circumspect.) This is because he made a lot of great records, and because he was a remarkably colorful character, and because human lives are complex. But it’s really way more because he never got caught. Reading Fuchs’s story makes it—or should make it—impossible to ever again consider Fowley’s legacy without also considering its human cost. Something that is rarely remembered about showbiz hustlers: The people they fuck over on their ceaseless quest for glory have to keep on living. (A personal note: It’s very difficult to avoid sounding sanctimonious when writing about crimes that stir a legitimate sense of moral outrage. But I also don’t want to deny the power of Fowley’s appeal as an enigma. The likelihood that he had made victims of many young girls was a cloud that loomed behind the silver lining of the fascinating rock ’n’ roll story [and records] he represented. One of the damaging aspects of lifelong immersion in art and culture is how easy it has always been to ignore the reality that belies the legend. Though I didn’t know Fuchs’s story on the two occasions when I met Fowley—at the Troubadour in LA in 1999 and at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010—I certainly knew he was a legendary sleaze. I would like to be the kind of person who refuses to shake the hand of the kind of person Fowley never made any bones about being, but I must confess: I was mildly starstruck and totally charmed by him, not to mention flattered that he knew and remembered who I was.) One of the great moments in the past 20 years of American cultural life came when Jerry Falwell died on May 15, 2007. Another came that same day when Anderson Cooper lobbed Christopher Hitchens the fattest, slowest softball question of either man’s career: “I’m not sure if you believe in heaven, but if you do, do you think Jerry Falwell is in it?” “No,” Hitchens replied, “and I think it’s a pity there isn’t a hell for him to go to.” Burn on, Kim Fowley. You don’t have to like codeine, molly, or benzos to agree that this Future shit is nasty. \"It's time, man. Damn, it's time.\" —The Education of Sonny Carson Rapper OG Maco recently sparked the internets by tweeting that his ATL neighbor Future has \"ruined countless lives\" with the drug advocacy in his music. I think it's absolutely super crucial that we have somebody in rap right now (and I don't mean you, dude—I mean somebody who people actually listen to) who is questioning the endless glamorization of drug consumption—if not the attendant brain/organ damage—that lots of young people (whose brains haven't even finished developing yet) are being absolutely saturated with via rap music. Which they should be, because rap is the most honest music in America. That said, this is Young Super Future, who just released the best work of his life with Dirty Sprite 2—and no, you don't have to like codeine, molly, or benzos to agree that this shit is nasty. Future's blues bemoan—just as much as they celebrate and exalt—his cold soul, his heartbreak, his addiction. (\"I gave up on my conscience, gotta live wit it/This remind me when I had nightmares.\") If you really like rap—and not just the way that rap informs your self-image, and not only the rap you or your friends make, or the rap you grew up on (or the shit that just sorta sounds like it, which you also might make yourself)—well goddamn, you really might just be enjoying all this good shit dropping in 2015 right now. Or that could all be bullshit. All I really know is that I am loving it. No, not your shit. Now sir, please, sit down. Okay, but maybe we need something more than the voices arguing about whose fault it is that people are fucked up on drugs (a tired argument I've been hearing since I was a kid). Something more soul-balming than yet another rock star's out-loud self-examination (no matter how great it is). What we need most are those rare voices who speak to the struggle, the only struggle. The struggle for existence and freedom—for breath. The breath that white supremacists, imagining their power slipping away, would deny black people. The breath denied Jonathan Sanders, choked to death by an officer who allegedly said, \"I'm gonna get that nigger.\" Breath denied Sandra Bland, found dead in her cell two days after being pulled over for switching lanes without a signal and \"assaulting an officer.\" Breath denied Kindra Chapman, also last week—another alleged jail suicide. More names, more dead from this war. If you want to hear somebody who knows these names and who's been on the front lines, connecting struggles worldwide since Ferguson, go check St. Louis's Tef Poe, who just released his opus War Machine 3. Go buy it on iTunes—I'll wait. Tef rightfully extols 2Pac as the patron saint of revolutionary rider shit, screaming holy war on his enemies—who possibly include street rivals, but definitely include tools of white supremacy: specific Missouri officials, neo-Nazis, even the Democratic Party. \"Now follow as we ride,\" as Makaveli said. Or as Sandra Bland herself said in one of her videos: \"It's time, y'all. It's time.\" Ticktock.",

As portrayed in the brilliant rock journalist Evelyn McDonnell’s book Queens of Noise: The Real Story of the Runaways, Kim Fowley was a guy who always knew exactly what he was getting away with. When Fowley died in January, he was mostly celebrated as an American original whose darker tendencies were generally subsumed by his undeniable creative energy and charismatic eccentricity. (McDonnell’s obit was a bit more circumspect.) This is because he made a lot of great records, and because he was a remarkably colorful character, and because human lives are complex. But it’s really way more because he never got caught. Reading Fuchs’s story makes it—or should make it—impossible to ever again consider Fowley’s legacy without also considering its human cost. Something that is rarely remembered about showbiz hustlers: The people they fuck over on their ceaseless quest for glory have to keep on living. (A personal note: It’s very difficult to avoid sounding sanctimonious when writing about crimes that stir a legitimate sense of moral outrage. But I also don’t want to deny the power of Fowley’s appeal as an enigma. The likelihood that he had made victims of many young girls was a cloud that loomed behind the silver lining of the fascinating rock ’n’ roll story [and records] he represented. One of the damaging aspects of lifelong immersion in art and culture is how easy it has always been to ignore the reality that belies the legend. Though I didn’t know Fuchs’s story on the two occasions when I met Fowley—at the Troubadour in LA in 1999 and at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010—I certainly knew he was a legendary sleaze. I would like to be the kind of person who refuses to shake the hand of the kind of person Fowley never made any bones about being, but I must confess: I was mildly starstruck and totally charmed by him, not to mention flattered that he knew and remembered who I was.) One of the great moments in the past 20 years of American cultural life came when Jerry Falwell died on May 15, 2007. Another came that same day when Anderson Cooper lobbed Christopher Hitchens the fattest, slowest softball question of either man’s career: “I’m not sure if you believe in heaven, but if you do, do you think Jerry Falwell is in it?” “No,” Hitchens replied, “and I think it’s a pity there isn’t a hell for him to go to.” Burn on, Kim Fowley.",

    "DiffbotBody": "On the Grid From the shale fields to the cooling towers, Trib Total Media covers the energy industry in Western Pennsylvania and beyond. For the latest news and views on gas, coal, electricity and more, check out On the Grid today. 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Saturday, July 11, 2015, 12:01 a.m. WASHINGTON — Parents may hesitate to hand teens the keys to the family car, but Congress is proposing to allow drivers as young as 18 to get behind the wheel of big rigs on the nation's interstates. Federal regulations require drivers be at least 21 before they can drive commercial trucks across state lines, but a bill introduced this week by Republican senators would allow contiguous states that join together in “compacts” to drop the age threshold to 18 for interstate trips. There is no limit on the number of states that could join the compacts. After four years, the Transportation secretary is supposed to report to Congress on whether teens have “an equivalent level of safety” in comparison with older truckers. In 2013, all drivers ages 18-20 had a fatal crash involvement rate, per 100,000 licensed drivers, that was 66 percent higher than drivers who were age 21 years or older, according to the Transportation Department's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, although the total number of crash deaths among teens has been declining since 2002. The change was sought by the trucking industry to help address a shortage of truck drivers. The American Trucking Association estimates that the current shortage of drivers is roughly 35,000 to 40,000, but because of retirements and individuals leaving the industry, trucking companies will need to recruit nearly 100,000 new drivers a year over the next decade to keep pace with the country's freight needs. But Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said allowing teens to drive trucks weighing as much as 80,000 pounds and to work as many as 82 hours a week, as is permitted in the truck industry, is a “catastrophe waiting to happen.” “The combination of inexperience, high-risk driving and large trucks can cause unbelievable devastation,” she said. Dave Osiecki, chief of advocacy for trucking associations, said states already allow teens to drive commercial trucks unlimited miles within their borders. For example, it makes no sense to allow a teen truck driver to drive hundreds of miles from one end to the other of a state like Virginia, but prohibit the same driver from crossing the Potomac River into Washington, he said. “We absolutely support” lowering the age limit, he said. “It would be good for our industry, it would be good for commerce, it would be good for the economy.” Legislation to allow states to lower the age for a commercial, interstate license to 18 was first introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and was incorporated into a larger transportation bill introduced this week by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Fischer. The bill would restrict teen truckers from hauling hazardous materials or operating “special configurations,” which are generally defined as oversized or overweight loads. States and the U.S. Department of Transportation would also be allowed to impose other restrictions if they wish. States wouldn't be obligated to join the compacts, but Gillan said she expects state officials would be under pressure from the trucking industry to do so. To obtain an interstate commercial driver's license, drivers must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test administered by a state motor vehicles department. But there is no requirement that drivers first receive on the road training or attend a training school, Gillan said. Labor unions have said the driver shortage could be eliminated by raising truckers' wages and improving working conditions. A decade ago the Bush administration looked at lowering the commercial truck driving age to 18, but ultimately decided against doing that because the public comments the government received were overwhelmingly against the idea.

    "DiffbotBody": "Africa's elephants are at risk of going extinct in large part because of poaching for the ivory, and advocates are hopeful that the U.S. government can stop the crisis with new rules at home. But there's a diverse and fierce lobbying coalition against the proposed rules barring the trade of ivory, and a House vote this week shows that it's going to be an uphill battle to protect them. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected this summer to propose rules banning the commercial trade of elephant ivory in the U.S. unless a product is shown to be in compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The rules wouldn't directly affect elephant poaching in Africa, but supporters say they will help turn the market against illegal ivory and put a dent in poaching, which has doubled since 2007. The U.S. is the second-largest market for illegal wildlife products, trailing only China. As many as 35,000 elephants were killed by poachers in 2012, according to the Interior Department, and their numbers are now below a half million in Africa. The Obama administration has made a crackdown on illegal wildlife trade a priority, highlighted by a spectacular crushing of a ton of illegal ivory in Times Square last month. \"The U.S. is a stunningly large black market for illegal wildlife products and most Americans don't realize it,\" said Don Barry, senior vice president of conservation programs for Defenders of Wildlife. \"A huge amount of illegal ivory is pouring in here that's smuggled, and then it's very difficult to keep it away from the ivory that's here legally. And trying to regulate it is like wrapping your lips around a fire hose.\" But the rule has found an unusual set of opponents. There's not a collaborative effort, but several parties are raising their own concerns. Hunting groups have said the rule is an overreach, while antiques dealers claim it would hurt their dealings. The National Rifle Association has said it would trample gun owners' rights to have guns with ivory handles. Even musicians, including the League of American Orchestras, have raised concerns with the rules, saying they would make it impossible to move pianos with ivory keys across international borders (FWS says there will be flexibilities in the proposed rule to address those concerns and last year built in allowances for musical instruments and museum specimens). Although the LAO has raised concerns about international travel, in a statement the group said it did not have a position on the broader Interior bill and was awaiting the rules on interstate commerce before taking a policy stance. Republicans, thus, have vowed to fight the rules, saying there are less-intrusive ways to protect the endangered elephant population. Their first strike came Tuesday over the debate on the Interior Department's fiscal 2016 appropriations bill, which contained a rider that would scrap the rules. Democrats, led by Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, offered up an amendment to remove the rider, which was seen as a trial balloon to gauge congressional support for protecting the FWS rules. In a sign of its importance, the NRA even scored the vote, putting pressure on the Republican base to stick together. Explaining its decision, the NRA said the regulations would be \"disastrous\" for sportsmen and gun owners, making \"American owners of legal ivory potential criminals overnight.\" The end result? It failed 183-244 largely along party lines. (The underlying spending bill was pulled Thursday due to controversy over the Confederate flag.) But it won't be the last attempt to attack the ivory rules, and it's possible that future vehicles will be tougher for Democrats to turn down. Chip Burkhalter, director of government relations for Safari Club International, said he was encouraged to see the Republican majority block the rules, saying it was an \"effective\" message. Similar language ditching the rules is included in a package from Republican Rep. Robert Wittman of Virginia that wraps up several measures to open up land for hunters and sportsmen. Traditionally the sportsmen's packages have attracted bipartisan support, and Wittman's bill has three Democratic cosponsors. A similar package in the Senate from Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski and New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich does not include the ivory language, although in previous sessions, lawmakers included it as an amendment. Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said he's planning to introduce legislation soon that would address the interstate regulations, adding that a sportsmen's package could be a possible vehicle. To be sure, nobody's trying to reopen illegal ivory trading and put elephants back at risk. The opponents just see the FWS rules as too heavy-handed and harmful for Americans. \"We want to promote conservation and protection in Africa, but ensure we protect the rights of those who have antique musical instruments and antique firearms,\" Daines said, adding that he'd like to see closer work with legal hunting groups. \"Hunters are the best conservationists, because they believe in the conservation of the species.\" Conservation groups, however, say the regulations are a necessary step that shifts the burden of proof away from the overtaxed Fish and Wildlife Service and onto owners and dealers. Beyond addressing the import and export of ivory, the FWS has also clarified the definition of \"antique,\" requiring an owner to certify that an item is more than 100 years old to qualify. Before the amendment vote, Grijalva had said he'd feel good if he was able to get just 140 members to vote for it, a target he cleared. Still, he said, there's been \"intense\" lobbying that has targeted Democrats, and nine members did cross over to vote in favor of the rider. Six Republicans, including Rep. Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, voted for Grijalva's amendment and in favor of the federal rules. \"Overall, getting a rule that works towards a ban while still allowing those legitimate functions to occur is a good idea,\" Grijalva said. He said the hope was that Democrats could hold off further attacks until the rule is published, which would allow opponents to see what sort of exemptions the government would allow. Barry said the rider was like \"trying to kill a mosquito with a shotgun\" because it was using slivers of opposition to try to defeat the entire effort. It is important, he added, to act quickly and convince members that the rule won't be as painful as critics say, before a stronger effort came forth. \"I've seen few issues that had a compelling reason for tougher regulatory control and restriction than to protect elephants,\" Barry said. \"Elephants are the symbol of the Republican Party and they're dying. If this isn't a crisis, I don't know what is.\" CORRECTION: The original version of this article said there were concerns about the rules affect transport of instruments across state lines rather than international borders. This article has also been updated to clarify the position of the League of American Orchestras.",

Al­though the LAO has raised con­cerns about in­ter­na­tion­al travel, in a state­ment the group said it did not have a po­s­i­tion on the broad­er In­teri­or bill and was await­ing the rules on in­ter­state com­merce be­fore tak­ing a policy stance. Re­pub­lic­ans, thus, have vowed to fight the rules, say­ing there are less-in­trus­ive ways to pro­tect the en­dangered ele­phant pop­u­la­tion. Their first strike came Tues­day over the de­bate on the In­teri­or De­part­ment’s fisc­al 2016 ap­pro­pri­ations bill, which con­tained a rider that would scrap the rules. Demo­crats, led by Rep. Raul Gri­jalva of Ari­zona, offered up an amend­ment to re­move the rider, which was seen as a tri­al bal­loon to gauge con­gres­sion­al sup­port for pro­tect­ing the FWS rules. In a sign of its im­port­ance, the NRA even scored the vote, put­ting pres­sure on the Re­pub­lic­an base to stick to­geth­er. Ex­plain­ing its de­cision, the NRA said the reg­u­la­tions would be “dis­astrous” for sports­men and gun own­ers, mak­ing “Amer­ic­an own­ers of leg­al ivory po­ten­tial crim­in­als overnight.” The end res­ult? It failed 183-244 largely along party lines. (The un­der­ly­ing spend­ing bill was pulled Thursday due to con­tro­versy over the Con­fed­er­ate flag.) But it won’t be the last at­tempt to at­tack the ivory rules, and it’s pos­sible that fu­ture vehicles will be tough­er for Demo­crats to turn down. Chip Burkhal­ter, dir­ect­or of gov­ern­ment re­la­tions for Sa­fari Club In­ter­na­tion­al, said he was en­cour­aged to see the Re­pub­lic­an ma­jor­ity block the rules, say­ing it was an “ef­fect­ive” mes­sage. Sim­il­ar lan­guage ditch­ing the rules is in­cluded in a pack­age from Re­pub­lic­an Rep. Robert Wittman of Vir­gin­ia that wraps up sev­er­al meas­ures to open up land for hunters and sports­men. Tra­di­tion­ally the sports­men’s pack­ages have at­trac­ted bi­par­tis­an sup­port, and Wittman’s bill has three Demo­crat­ic co­spon­sors. A sim­il­ar pack­age in the Sen­ate from Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski and New Mex­ico Demo­crat­ic Sen. Mar­tin Hein­rich does not in­clude the ivory lan­guage, al­though in pre­vi­ous ses­sions, law­makers in­cluded it as an amend­ment. Montana Re­pub­lic­an Sen. Steve Daines said he’s plan­ning to in­tro­duce le­gis­la­tion soon that would ad­dress the in­ter­state reg­u­la­tions, adding that a sports­men’s pack­age could be a pos­sible vehicle. To be sure, nobody’s try­ing to re­open il­leg­al ivory trad­ing and put ele­phants back at risk. The op­pon­ents just see the FWS rules as too heavy-handed and harm­ful for Amer­ic­ans. “We want to pro­mote con­ser­va­tion and pro­tec­tion in Africa, but en­sure we pro­tect the rights of those who have an­tique mu­sic­al in­stru­ments and an­tique fire­arms,” Daines said, adding that he’d like to see closer work with leg­al hunt­ing groups. “Hunters are the best con­ser­va­tion­ists, be­cause they be­lieve in the con­ser­va­tion of the spe­cies.” Con­ser­va­tion groups, however, say the reg­u­la­tions are a ne­ces­sary step that shifts the bur­den of proof away from the over­taxed Fish and Wild­life Ser­vice and onto own­ers and deal­ers. Bey­ond ad­dress­ing the im­port and ex­port of ivory, the FWS has also cla­ri­fied the defin­i­tion of “an­tique,” re­quir­ing an own­er to cer­ti­fy that an item is more than 100 years old to qual­i­fy. Be­fore the amend­ment vote, Gri­jalva had said he’d feel good if he was able to get just 140 mem­bers to vote for it, a tar­get he cleared. Still, he said, there’s been “in­tense” lob­by­ing that has tar­geted Demo­crats, and nine mem­bers did cross over to vote in fa­vor of the rider. Six Re­pub­lic­ans, in­clud­ing Rep. Ed Whit­field of Ken­tucky, voted for Gri­jalva’s amend­ment and in fa­vor of the fed­er­al rules. “Over­all, get­ting a rule that works to­wards a ban while still al­low­ing those le­git­im­ate func­tions to oc­cur is a good idea,” Gri­jalva said. He said the hope was that Demo­crats could hold off fur­ther at­tacks un­til the rule is pub­lished, which would al­low op­pon­ents to see what sort of ex­emp­tions the gov­ern­ment would al­low. Barry said the rider was like “try­ing to kill a mos­quito with a shot­gun” be­cause it was us­ing sliv­ers of op­pos­i­tion to try to de­feat the en­tire ef­fort. It is im­port­ant, he ad­ded, to act quickly and con­vince mem­bers that the rule won’t be as pain­ful as crit­ics say, be­fore a stronger ef­fort came forth. “I’ve seen few is­sues that had a com­pel­ling reas­on for tough­er reg­u­lat­ory con­trol and re­stric­tion than to pro­tect ele­phants,” Barry said. “Ele­phants are the sym­bol of the Re­pub­lic­an Party and they’re dy­ing. If this isn’t a crisis, I don’t know what is.” COR­REC­TION: The ori­gin­al ver­sion of this art­icle said there were con­cerns about the rules af­fect trans­port of in­stru­ments across state lines rather than in­ter­na­tion­al bor­ders. This art­icle has also been up­dated to cla­ri­fy the po­s­i­tion of the League of Amer­ic­an Or­ches­tras.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Matti Makkonen died last week and was celebrated as the father of SMS. He’s been described as being too modest to acknowledge his involvement. It seems, however, that the story of how Short Messaging came to be is far more complicated than we originally thought, and the system has many fathers. In fact, not only did Makkonen not invent SMS, he also reneged on an agreement with those who did to stop claiming that he did. Makkonen’s lie – inadvertent or not – saw him recognised by the Finnish Government as one of the Great Finns, alongside composer Sibelius, and he was awarded the 1999 Economist Innovation Award alongside Tim Berners-Lee and Bill Gates. The true story is told in the book Short Message Service (SMS): The Creation of Personal Global Text Messaging, edited by Friedhelm Hillebrand with contributions by Finn Trosby, Kevin Holley and Ian Harris. It’s published by Wiley. Hillebrand has a chronology on his website. The authors were all part of the teams which produced the specifications for GSM, including SMS. The second chapter of the book documents the creation of SMS and treads carefully around the terms “invent” and “discover” – which is relevant, since pagers and other text services had been around long before the development of GSM started in 1982, so the book claims. Someone using a different technology might therefore be seen as a “pioneer”, rather than an “inventor”. One different technology that comes into play here is ISDN, the digital phone service which predated broadband. This was able to transmit faster speeds than a regular telephone modem, despite also working on a dial-up basis. A channel was a heady 64kbps and you often got two channels. 128kbps seemed lightning-fast in a world of 14.4kbps modem connectivity. ISDN had a control channel – a low-bandwidth, 16kbps signalling channel. When the GSM standards were created, ISDN was used to inform some of the decisions. Although it was quite an esoteric feature, there was some discussion of text message handling over ISDN, but no standards emerged. The SMS inventors approached the ISDN standards people in the name of interworking, but their suggestions fell on deaf ears. Kevin Holley (left), Friedhelm Hillebrand (centre), Finn Trosby (right) The book debunks quite a bit of SMS folklore, including the idea that it was created by engineers for testing and the story that it was an epiphany in a pizzeria. To try and get to the bottom of who invented SMS, Hillebrand, Trosby, Holley and Harris met with Thomas Beijer, Philippe Dupuis, Thomas Haug, Seppo Tiamen and Matti Makkonen – all people who’d had their names attached to the creation of SMS. It is not recorded whether they had pizza. As is often the way with people who have spent their whole lives writing tight technical specifications, it's not exactly riveting narrative. It takes a bit of decoding, so where the official document doesn't name names, we've spoken to those involved and annotated the definitive history of how SMS happened: Text messaging was a known telecommunications service years before the development of GSM started in 1982. Proposals for text messaging as a service for GSM were made by the co-operating Nordic operators, as well as by co-operating German and French operators (France being represented by Bernard Ghillebaert and Germany by Friedhelm Hillebrand). The Nordic operators focused their work on text messaging by using it as access to a message handling system (similar to email). This was standardised by the GSM committee and it led to a technical report on the technical realisation of access to message handling systems (the Nordic person being Finn Trosby). The German and French operators focused their work on Short Message Transmission. The proposed service used a dedicated service centre and transmitted the text messages over existing signalling paths of the GSM telephony system on a lower-priority basis. This transmission method meant that the messages had to be short. Packet length was initially estimated at 128 octets, but this was later optimised to 160 characters – still sufficiently long enough for most personal and professional purposes. The concept was developed in the Franco-German co-operation in the 1983/4 timeframe (again, Ghillebaert and Hillebrand). In a first phase of work from Feb 1985 to the end of 1986, the GSM Committee specified the service features of the Short Message Service. Most contributions came from Germany and France (ditto). From 1987 onwards, the technical realisation of SMS was standardised in a small group called DRAFTING GROUP on Message Handling. The first chairman of this group and the editor of the key technical specification were provided by Norway (later the UK) and the technical work mostly provided by Finland, France, Norway and the UK (Norway: Finn Trosby, UK: Kevin Holley \u0026 Alan Cox, Finland: Eija Altonen (the only woman in the history), France: Didier Luizard). The further evolution of the SMS was standardised in the same small group led by the UK, where the technical work was mostly provided by the UK. Examples of enhancements from this period are auto replacement of messages, so called “flash” SMS and voicemail icons, followed by colour and picture capabilities and long SMS. The meeting concluded that it had been a team effort. What is notable about the agreement is that it doesn’t name names, so the generally held view that the true inventor of SMS was too modest to acknowledge his invention certainly holds some truth. It has been separately reported that no-one on the team had dreamed of the success of SMS, and thought instead that it might steal a little of the pager market. Message in a battle One person not mentioned in the approved history is Arthur Gidlow, who determined that text messages should be up to 160 characters in length, based on that being twice the length of a pager message at the time, as Holley explained to The Register. You can learn a little more about Kevin Holley’s involvement on his website, and find a history of SMS on Prof Stephen Temple’s site. This includes a copy of Holley’s 1991 paper (PDF) on SMS. The history is also told in various other books by Friedhelm Hillebrand. It is not true that Short Message Service was named after Holley’s boss at the time, Mike Short. We corroborated the facts in this story with Dr Mike Short CBE – who is now a VP at Telefonica – and we are grateful for his help. So how did it come to pass that Matti Makkonen became credited with the invention? It seems that a throwaway line from Makkonen got blown out of proportion and the fame then went to his head. Following our enquiries, Thomas Haug, the chairman of GSM at the time, checked the early GSM attendance lists and found that Matti Makkonen did indeed attend a few early GSM meetings, but had absolutely nothing to do with the creation of the Short Message Service. Prof Temple told El Reg that it was \"a set of circumstances which rolled out of control\". It appears that Makkonen, then a local Nokia manager, went out for a pizza with a journalist from a local Finnish paper. During the interview, he made a casual remark that he had imagined the potential of sending text messages on mobile phones. The journalist then embellished the story that he was the “father of SMS”. As much as he may have had that thought, it’s clear that he didn’t ever submit it to anyone working on GSM standards. As turgid as all the standards documentation is, it’s amazingly comprehensive on who attended which meetings, which are minuted in detail. It’s worth bearing in mind that decisions made in the committees can have massive financial effects for the participating companies which own any related IP. Makkonen later claimed to have tried to correct this with the local paper. He told them he was not claiming to be the father of SMS, but this was spun by the journalist into an even better story of “the modest hero” who was the father of SMS. This was put on file and then found its way into a national Finnish newspaper, apparently with no fact-checking, and from there it became “established fact”. At the Helsinki conflab where the people who did invent SMS tried to put the record straight – the one published in the Wiley book listed above – he admitted to them that he had nothing to do with the creation of texting. The engineers took pity on him. All reports – including one from a Reg reader who was related to him – show him as a well-meaning, gentle person who just had his head turned by fame and celebrity. It was agreed that they would not expose his lie, in return for his assurance that he would no longer claim to have created SMS and would pass on all future enquiries about the origins of SMS to them. This gentlemen’s agreement did not last. He accepted an interview with the BBC on the 20th anniversary of SMS that put the myth firmly back on track. There is a huge irony in this: the true creators of SMS remain so modest about their invention that they have been usurped in the public eye by someone who didn't do the work and yet has been accused of being too modest. They bear him no malice and see it as the fault of circumstances. To this day if you ask the men whose names are on the GSM documents \"So, which one of you came up with the idea of using the signalling channel for text messages?\" they hedge and hide behind it being a group effort. ®",
    "LabBody": "Matti Makkonen died last week and was celebrated as the father of SMS. He’s been described as being too modest to acknowledge his involvement. It seems, however, that the story of how Short Messaging came to be is far more complicated than we originally thought, and the system has many fathers. In fact, not only did Makkonen not invent SMS, he also reneged on an agreement with those who did to stop claiming that he did. Makkonen’s lie – inadvertent or not – saw him recognised by the Finnish Government as one of the Great Finns, alongside composer Sibelius, and he was awarded the 1999 Economist Innovation Award alongside Tim Berners-Lee and Bill Gates. The true story is told in the book Short Message Service (SMS): The Creation of Personal Global Text Messaging, edited by Friedhelm Hillebrand with contributions by Finn Trosby, Kevin Holley and Ian Harris. It’s published by Wiley. Hillebrand has a chronology on his website. The authors were all part of the teams which produced the specifications for GSM, including SMS. The second chapter of the book documents the creation of SMS and treads carefully around the terms “invent” and “discover” – which is relevant, since pagers and other text services had been around long before the development of GSM started in 1982, so the book claims. Someone using a different technology might therefore be seen as a “pioneer”, rather than an “inventor”. One different technology that comes into play here is ISDN, the digital phone service which predated broadband. This was able to transmit faster speeds than a regular telephone modem, despite also working on a dial-up basis. A channel was a heady 64kbps and you often got two channels. 128kbps seemed lightning-fast in a world of 14.4kbps modem connectivity. ISDN had a control channel – a low-bandwidth, 16kbps signalling channel. When the GSM standards were created, ISDN was used to inform some of the decisions. Although it was quite an esoteric feature, there was some discussion of text message handling over ISDN, but no standards emerged. The SMS inventors approached the ISDN standards people in the name of interworking, but their suggestions fell on deaf ears. The book debunks quite a bit of SMS folklore, including the idea that it was created by engineers for testing and the story that it was an epiphany in a pizzeria. To try and get to the bottom of who invented SMS, Hillebrand, Trosby, Holley and Harris met with Thomas Beijer, Philippe Dupuis, Thomas Haug, Seppo Tiamen and Matti Makkonen – all people who’d had their names attached to the creation of SMS. It is not recorded whether they had pizza. As is often the way with people who have spent their whole lives writing tight technical specifications, it's not exactly riveting narrative.

The airline, promoted by former Congress MP and actor K Chiranjeevi’s son and actor Ram Charan Tej, has two 72-seater ATR 72-500 aircraft obtained on dry lease from an Irish company, and hopes to acquire five aircraft in total in a phased manner.According Turbo Megha Airways Director Prem Kumar, the promoters have so far invested Rs 500 crore in the venture and expect to break even in the next 3-4 years of time. The airline, which has an agreement for maintenance with the GMR airports MRO at Shamsabad airport here, will have its own Component MRO in place at a cost of Rs 20 crore, which will be operational by the end of this year.In terms of routes and destinations, the airline is targeting a wide range of places. “Initially, the airline will offer its service towards linking Rajahmundry with Hyderabad, Tirupati and Chennai to meet the Godavari Pushkaram time. From July 26 onwards, we will operate flights from Hyderabad linking Tirupati, Aurangabad and Rajahmundry,” Managing Director and co-promoter V Umesh told reporters here.Ram Charan Tej added that the new airline will offer 10 per cent rebate on basic ticket fare for senior citizens, and South Indian movie fraternity, and 10 seats for students under 18 years of age in each flight, while the base fare is fixed at Rs 1,499. “Unlike other cost-conscious airlines, we are also offering free meals for all our passengers,” he added. The airline is also offering free pick-up and drop for passengers of Shirdi, Chittoor and Nellore to their nearest airport.",

The decision could be construed as a throwback to the setting of the original books written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a contemporary to his own fictional creations.

And when doing the Victorian, the press came in and said how can he do this without his iPhone?\" \"It's very much the show you know. It's the Sherlock as you know it, but in the correct era.

    "LabBody": "Dog Abandoned at Train Station with His Suitcase. Tuesday, a picture of dog in Scotland went viral. He had been tied to a railing at Ayr station, and was found with a small suitcase containing his belongings: a food dish, a pillow, a dog toy, and some dog food. The dog, a mixed breed resembling a shar-pei, was taken to the SSPCA. Officials there found a microchip, but the last record said the dog named Kai had been sold on the internet site Gumtree in 2013, but not to whom. Today, the Daily Record identified the woman who left the dog at the station as Fin Rayner. Rayner said she met a man to buy a dog through Gumtree, but the dog was not as advertised and the man fled with a £150 deposit, leaving her with Kai. Rayner does not believe she did anything wrong by leaving the dog at the station. Meanwhile, the SSPCA has received many calls from people who want Kai. Turn Signal Removed from Arm 51 Years After Wreck. Arthur Lampitt of Granite City, Illinois, wrecked his new Thunderbird. He suffered multiple injuries, the worst of which was a shattered hip. That was in 1963. A few years ago, Lampitt set off a metal detector that indicated there was metal embedded in his arm, although it didn’t bother him. Recently, the arm began to bulge and hurt, so he decided to have the metal removed. He thought that it might have been a surgical instrument left from 1963. When the operation was done, doctors removed a 7-inch piece of metal that was identified as a Thunderbird turn signal handle! Doctors were surprised that the arm never became infected. They say Lampitt’s body grew a protective pouch around the metal all those years ago. Surgery for Constipated Goldfish. A devoted pet owner in North Walsham, Norfolk, UK, took his goldfish to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre because the fish was constipated. The only way to save the fish was with surgery, which cost £300 ($454). After a few minutes consideration, the owner opted for the surgery. Veterinarian Faye Bethell performed the procedure, which involved removing lumps from two places in the fish. Each cut was covered with three stitches and sealed with waterproof glue. Bethell said, \"The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anesthetic is quite complicated. \"The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died. \"There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.\" Mrs. Doubtfire House a Victim of Arson. The house in San Francisco where the film Mrs. Doubtfire was filmed was converted into a makeshift shrine when star Robin Williams died in August. Then on Monday evening, two fires were set on the porch. The current homeowner, Dr. Douglas K. Ousterhout, is a renowned craniofacial surgeon. Ousterhout put out the fires himself and called police. On Wednesday, police arrested one of Ousterhout’s former patients, 25-year-old Tyqwon Eugenen Welch. The arrest should extinguish rumors of a large elderly woman starting a fire while trying to cook. Boa Constrictor Emerges From Toilet. Stephanie Lacsa runs a business in downtown San Diego. When a toilet appeared to be stopped up, she took a plunger to it. She was astonished to find that the stoppage was caused by a 5-foot boa constrictor. When she removed the plunger, the snake came slithering out, flicking its tongue at her! Lacsa and her business partner climbed atop their desks to avoid the snake. Animal control responded and identified the snake as a Colombian rainbow boa constrictor. According to the news video, the building’s landlord found out that the snake belonged to another tenant. Minivan Dragged 16 Miles by Truck. Matt and Pamela Menz were traveling in their minivan with their two children during the snowstorm Wednesday morning on I-75 in Michigan when they slid into a tractor-trailer. The minivan became wedged under the back end of the truck, which the truck driver did not notice. The minivan lost power, so Menz could not blow the horn, flash the lights, or even see where they were going. Pamela Menz called 911 and told the Roscommon County dispatcher what had happened, but they could not see the mile markers to give a location. The truck driver eventually left the interstate, and Matt Menz was able to identify the exit. Police pulled the truck driver over, still unaware that he’d been towing the minivan. They had covered 16 miles over the 25-minute ride. The Menz family was uninjured, but were taken to a local hospital to be checked out. You can hear portions of the 911 call in a video at WOOD.",

'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By Jonah Goldberg Friday, July 10, 2015, 8:57 p.m. Poor Donald Trump. It wasn't supposed to be like this. For years, wherever The Donald went, he met people who told him he should run for president. His retinue of sycophants surely saw little to gain from explaining that “birthers,” celebrity worshippers and devotees of “The Apprentice” are not a statistically meaningful sample of the electorate. In the past, Trump always pulled back from the brink. Why risk his beloved TV show? Why endure the embarrassment of revealing he's not as rich as he pretends? Flirt but don't commit was the rule. But something changed. One too many Twitter followers said, “Do it!” One too many valets whispered, “America needs you” — probably just before asking for a raise. And Trump took the leap — though he hasn't provided the required financial disclosures yet, which inclines me to think that he will either suddenly find an excuse to retreat or that he has a team of accountants trying to figure out how he can simultaneously save face and avoid perjury. In his announcement speech — the brevity and discipline of which were impressive only by the standards of Fidel Castro or Joe Biden — Trump shouted his certainty that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals to America, but he could only “assume” (sotto voce) that “some” of those Mexicans are good people. Trump's commitment to the GOP has often been situational. Sure, he has put his money where his mouth is, but he's as promiscuous with his mouth as he is with the Trump brand. He's given money to Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Andrew Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and the Clinton Foundation. Asked to explain why, he said, “You're gonna need things from everybody.” (One does wonder what Trump hoped to get from the Clinton Foundation.) This attitude helps explain why Trump is such a fan of eminent domain. The man seeking the tea party's support loves to use the government to seize private land he can't — or doesn't want to — buy fairly. Given the fetid swamp of sanctioned corruption that passes for commerce in New York, it's no wonder he sees nothing wrong with greasing the skids by funding liberal politicians. The great irony is that the man who made his fortune playing the game of influence-peddling and celebrity-mongering forgot that the other players get a turn. Trump has lost his TV show. Macy's will no longer carry his menswear. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who governs like a banana republic demagogue, has declared that he is reviewing Trump's contracts with the city. Meanwhile, too many of Trump's GOP primary competitors, afraid of angering his fans, stand mute or mumbling. Republicans are fielding the best candidates in a generation, but Trump is poised to make them chumps by association. He has no chance of becoming president, but he has the huge potential to deny his alleged party a White House victory in 2016. And when that happens, he will of course stay a celebrity, but he will have traded his fame for infamy, even among those now cheering him on.

The Texas senator's book ranks fourth on The Wall Street Journal hardcover list and fourth on the Publisher's Weekly hardcover list, Politico points out. And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",

    "DiffbotBody": "A long read about the Grateful Dead's 50th anniversary shows, their remarkable fans, and what happens next... Three hours before The Grateful Dead begin their brief and poignant farewell tour in Santa Clara, California, a couple called Jeremy and Karen are setting up their stall of bespoke tie-dyed articles in the parking lot. As they arrange the $70 silk shirts and $10 bandannas, they are talking of their times on the road following the band; journeys which began in the 1970s for both of them, and which reached a sustained climax for Jeremy between 1987 and 1995, when he was present at every one of the Dead’s last 300-odd shows. “It wasn’t just music,” he says now, looking like a cross between Jerry Garcia and John Goodman. “The term Utopia is very maligned in society, especially in this age. What we had wasn’t a working blueprint for Utopia, but it was an unfolding better way of living, away from the safety net of a society that acts as either a sieve or a meat grinder. It was a different way of doing things. It had all the regular trappings and problems of society, but it offered hope.” A few hundred metres away, Santa Clara’s year-old Levi’s Stadium, normally home to the San Francisco 49ers, awaits today’s influx of 83,000 multifarious Deadheads. Lifers like Jeremy and Karen mingle with new young fans, and a great many middle-aged men and women whose love of the Dead has endured long after their own quests for Utopia have ended. Over the next two weekends, the four remaining core members of the Grateful Dead and their accomplices will play five Fare Thee Well shows, two here and three in Chicago, which will reportedly net $40 million in ticket sales alone. Out in the parking lots, however, a more idiosyncratic brand of entrepreneurship is flourishing, even while cops patrol the aisles on golf buggies. This is Shakedown Street, storied hub of the grey economy that has long clustered around the Dead, an ad hoc marketplace for all your quainter hippy needs. Hash pipes proliferate, as do conch shells and vegetarian burritos. There are drum circles, hackysack players, dogs in bandannas, and t-shirt memorials to Brent Mydland, one of the multiple keyboard players who died during the Grateful Dead’s original lifespan between 1965 and 1995. A large man loudly advertises the hash brownies that he is selling, neatly packaged in branded plastic containers. Another wanders through the crowds, carrying a mysterious box labelled “Take a gift”. Jeremy, though, has a living to make. The day Jerry Garcia died, Tuesday August 9, 1995, he postponed thoughts of getting a job for a good 24 hours. The next day he found work at the University of Santa Cruz, but soon took to the road again, selling his tie-dyes at festivals through the summers, until it became harder and harder to survive the winters. Finally, he had an idea; America’s only make-your-own tie-dye store, A Brighter World. “Jeremy’s one of the few people who made it,” says Karen. “Everybody had their little things – I crocheted crazy stuff to get me across the country – but he actually turned it into a business. People who can combine the hippy thing with a work ethic, they can find a really interesting way to live.” Jeremy claims he is mostly here to promote his business. After several hundred shows, though, a profound emotional attachment to the Dead remains, transcending his cynicism over the premise of Fare Thee Well, and his scepticism that the band can still be meaningful without Garcia. “I just hope they play like it’s their last one, as opposed to going through the motions,” he finally decides. “It could be like going to someone’s house for a home-cooked meal but they got sick, so they ordered out. It’s OK, but I hope it won’t be like that…” Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… A long read about the Grateful Dead's 50th anniversary shows, their remarkable fans, and what happens next... Forty-three miles from San Francisco, Santa Clara does not feel quite like a spiritual home of The Grateful Dead. Larry Livermore, who saw the Dead at least 25 times before becoming a key player in the Bay Area punk scene and discovering Green Day, describes the city as “basically the Milton Keynes of Silicon Valley”. “I saw them in many places; parks, dancehalls, at Woodstock,” he says, “but I think I might have drawn the line at Santa Clara.” This, though, is more or less where the Dead began, growing up in nearby Palo Alto and working their way through local pizza restaurants and music stores until Ken Kesey’s acid tests led them into San Francisco itself. In David Browne’s new Dead biography, So Many Roads, he describes a night in 1962 when Jorma Kaukonen, soon to form Jefferson Airplane, arrived at Santa Clara College from his home in Washington DC. On Kaukonen’s first day on campus, Browne writes, “he wandered into a folk club and met Garcia and a young, throat-shredding Texas transplant named Janis Joplin.” In the intervening 50-odd years, much has changed in the area. “When Jerry was growing up, what is now Silicon Valley was all fruit groves,” says Dennis McNally. “In the Dead’s lifetime, it has become one of the economic engines of America and, in fact, the world. It encapsulates the history of the last 50 years, 75 years.” Bucolic hippy innocence, evolving into digital idealism, maturing to technocratic capitalism in its most intense form: it’s a neat summary of the journey undertaken by at least some of the Dead’s followers. The band’s fans were early mainstays of online messageboards, while Steve Jobs and his partner at Apple, Steve Wozniak, McNally notes, were formative Deadheads (Wozniak promoted an ’80s festival headlined by the Dead; Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell, is reportedly present at the Santa Clara show). It’s a transformation that some will also see as of a piece with the mainstream compromises made by the Dead in the latter stages of their career, and by the organisers of Fare Thee Well. The Levi’s Stadium, for instance, is not the most idyllic of venues. When the band had growth spurts in the mid-’70s and ’80s, however, such vast spaces became their home for most of the summer months. “Jerry once complained about playing a stadium show because he felt he had to make the music cartoonish,” says McNally. “Very broad gestures. I remember a band meeting in December 1985, in which the band sat and agreed, rather stonily and with some regret, that they would have to do stadium shows because of the demand. It was not a joyful decision.” Kreutzmann, true to form, is equally sceptical in Deal, complaining about how the lack of nuance in stadium shows made them “safe… and safe equals boring.” Ominously, he also takes some perverse pride in listing all the significant gigs that his band messed up through their original career. “Just like at Monterey Pop and all the other big shows,” he writes, referring to their performance at Woodstock, “the Grateful Dead blew it.” Back at the tie-dye stall on Shakedown Street, however, Karen is philosophical: “Yeah, we all wish they’d done it the old way where the tour ‘Heads got the first shot at the tickets, we all wish it was a smaller venue. We’re all gonna complain and bitch, but this is all we’re gonna get. Part of me thinks we should all just shut up and get over it.” Heads up!

Above the Levi’s Stadium, a plane makes repeated attempts to draw a peace sign with its vapour trail. Inside, one concourse has been given over to Participation Row, where stalls represent a motley collection of charities and pressure groups sanctioned by Dead members. At its furthest extreme the action is especially interesting, with representatives of MAPS – the Multidisciplinary Association For Psychedelic Studies, who advocate for the psychotherapeutic use of LSD and MDMA in treating life-threatening illnesses – positioned right next to the Owsley Stanley Foundation. “Bear” Stanley’s home-made acid fuelled the psychedelic revolution in San Francisco, but it is his work as the Dead’s soundman, and as someone who recorded over a thousand concerts by everyone from Miles Davis to Doc Watson, that the Foundation promotes, raising funds to digitally preserve his disintegrating tape archive. On the field inside the Stadium, the amateur tapers have, as tradition dictates, a demarcated area for them to record the show. As Radiohead’s “House Of Cards” fades, however, and the seven-piece band amble on and slope into a loose, jazzy jam, even the most assiduous fans might be hard pressed to identify the song with which the Grateful Dead begin Fare Thee Well. Five minutes in, a shape emerges. This is “Truckin'”, a chemically-enhanced road choogle from 1970’s American Beauty, and a rare anthem in a catalogue that is mostly too imaginative and devious to make such obvious moves. Bob Weir is singing Garcia’s old part, and while Anastasio is grinning so broadly that it seems he can barely believe his luck, his playing is commendably unostentatious. Much of the fancier work, in fact, is done by the two keyboardists: pianist Bruce Hornsby, who took time off from his solo career to become a floating Dead member in the early ’90s; and Chimenti, a longtime associate of Lesh and Weir, who is apparently playing Brent Mydland’s old Hammond B3. “Truckin'” provides a gentle opening to a show that stretches over four and a half hours, including an hour-long interval, and features 17 songs – none of which were originally recorded any later than 1970. The first set gradually builds up speed, taking in a frail and lovely “Uncle John’s Band”, admittedly a little more Margaritaville than Wild West honky-tonk, before gaining momentum after 40 minutes with a wonderful “Cumberland Blues”. There are beautifully-evoked flashbacks to the band’s dancehall roots, baroque psychedelic grooves like “Alligator” and “Born Cross-Eyed”. Perhaps best and most unexpected of all, Anastasio pilots a scything take on “Cream Puff War”, a rarity from their eponymous ’67 debut that’s been neglected by the band for the past 48 years and that, had it not been so thoroughly overshadowed by what came after, might now be regarded as a garage nugget to match Love’s “7 And 7 Is”. At the climax of “Viola Lee Blues”, in the most elevating jam of the first half, and on the weekend that the United States legalise gay marriage, a perfect rainbow appears above the stage. It is all, perhaps, too good to be true. Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… A long read about the Grateful Dead's 50th anniversary shows, their remarkable fans, and what happens next... Before the show begins, Karen from the tie-dye stall tries to explain how the Dead crowd became factionalised in the mid-’80s, when an influx of unruly younger fans brought new levels of chaos and disruption to the band’s shows and generally “pissed off everyone”. “We weren’t here to get wasted,” she says. “We were here to see the shows and the whole LSD thing was part of the experience. We didn’t make people mad in small towns. We knew not to sleep downtown, not to panhandle, not to drag our dirty puppies through restaurants. “The best quote I ever heard was, ‘It used to be a zoo of a kind, now it’s kind of a zoo.’ It was said by one of my friends, tripping in the middle of the night. I think,” she laughs, “his name was Wind.” The day after, a couple of miles from the stadium, I meet a dishevelled twentysomething who is a kind of millennial equivalent of the people Karen described. He has only grubby socks on his feet, and is begging because he is “desperate for a pair of shoes for tonight’s show.” The events that befell him after the previous night’s concert are, to say the least, unclear, and he has no idea where his friends are or where he is meant to be staying. Throughout it all, though, he has held on to his skateboard, and to a cache of “really good LSD I’m trying to get rid of”. With a very old solution to a very modern problem, he offers acid in exchange for the use of a cellphone charger. It would be churlish, of course, to see his behaviour as dishonouring the drug etiquette of vintage Deadheads. Tom, from Idaho, is a veteran of 50-odd shows by the Dead and their offshoots, and first saw the band at the massive Watkins Glen show in 1973, when they shared a bill with the Allman Brothers and The Band in front of 600,000 people. Tom drove down to Watkins Glen from Boston, and remembers it as “one of the wildest times of my life. I was doing meth and peyote. I was 18, with nine friends, we were nuts. By the time we went home there were only three of us left, the rest of them we lost. They couldn’t handle it, they had to get the fuck out. It was mayhem; overwhelming.” At 9.40, the atmosphere for the evening’s second set is sensational. Traditionally, the latter half of Dead shows privileged the more expansive and exploratory side of their art, and tonight is no exception. After a prologue of “Cryptical Envelopment” – quaveringly sung by Phil Lesh in a voice that, for all its weathered charisma, remains mostly unsuitable for fronting a rock band – the literal and metaphorical fireworks begin. “Dark Star” was established as the Dead’s signature jam in 1968, and tonight’s 30-minute version is a bracing reiteration of the band’s uncanny chemistry. In So Many Roads, David Browne describes a “Dark Star” from November 1969. He writes of how Lesh, with his wildly ambulatory basslines, briefly appeared to be “wrestling for control of the song,” before “Garcia would take command but then retreat back into the song’s haze… Lesh wouldn’t be steering ‘Dark Star’ for long,” Browne observes. “In fact, no one would.” Trey Anastasio is, as discussed, no Jerry Garcia. As the 2015 “Dark Star” unravels, however, his discretion acts as a useful analogue for the slippery ways in which Garcia subverted his role of lead guitarist. Like the best Dead jams, all the elements – Anastasio’s sculpted leads and Weir’s impressionistic rhythm guitar flecks, the two percolating drummers, the two elegantly interpretive keyboardists – seem to be on their own trajectories: following orbits which only occasionally intersect; untethered by anything remotely resembling an orthodox bassline. Its success seems more down to chance than traditional musical logic and, if Anastasio succeeds at anything tonight, it is in insinuating himself into such a mystifyingly intuitive unit. At times like this, the Dead’s ability to hold the attention of nearly 100,000 people while playing radically weird music, remains astonishing. The traditional “Drums \u003e Space” jam is an especial challenge, beginning with Kreutzmann and Hart methodically working round several dozen percussion instruments, and progressing through a kind of tribal techno that is, perhaps unwittingly, reminiscent of a Spiral Tribe or Megadog rave in the early ’90s. When their bandmates return for the “Space” improvisation, Anastasio finally slips in some of the prog quackery that makes much of the Phish canon a hard sell to those averse to such whimsical excess. It is, though, a rare indulgence on Anastasio’s part. Discipline isn’t something traditionally associated with continuous jams that last for nearly two and a half hours, but this is the prevailing mood of the second set, and its two magnificent highlights. First there is “St Stephen”, euphorically punching its way out of the skronk. Then, at the end, there is Bonnie Dobson’s “Morning Dew”, originally attempted by the band on their debut album, and here essayed with a bluesy grace and spaciousness that feels restrained even when Anastasio lets his notes hang and arc in the air, and Bob Weir, lugubrious in trademark shorts and sandals, pushes his hearty but limited voice as far as it will possibly go. Finally, Hornsby leads them through one more of the homespun singalongs from Workingman’s Blues, “Casey Jones”. Apposite quotes for most occasions leap out of the discography of any band with a long career. The Grateful Dead are no exception, with a rich catalogue – mostly written by Garcia’s old friend, Robert Hunter – that presents risk, fate and mortality as part of some picaresque outlaw adventure. The refrain of “Casey Jones”, though – “Trouble ahead, trouble behind” – feels particularly useful. For all the stage-managed finality of Fare Thee Well, this is very much an ongoing story. Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… A long read about the Grateful Dead's 50th anniversary shows, their remarkable fans, and what happens next... Over the next four shows, the band play 68 more songs from every phase of their career, only repeating two (“Cumberland Blues” and, not unreasonably, “Truckin'”). The phrase “Greatest American Band” is thrown around a lot, and Barack Obama sends his regards. The first night rainbow is investigated at length, and initial stories that it was a son et lumiere stunt appear to be discounted. The general feeling mixes exhilaration with qualified relief: perhaps Phil Lesh sang a little more often than necessary; perhaps the pace dragged now and again; maybe the setlists ranged far and wide in a way that only someone attending all five nights could really appreciate. Nevertheless, consensus suggests Anastasio nailed his seemingly impossible brief and, for once, the Grateful Dead didn’t screw up the big shows. It’s hard to portray the whole Fare Thee Well project as anything other than a lucratively nostalgic endeavour, with its attendant live streams, cinema screenings, imminent commemorative boxsets and so forth; as one last trip for the baby boomer generation, and for those successive generations who dreamed of being a part of it. At the first night in Santa Clara, though, the crowd is celebratory rather than sentimental, and pragmatically informed about what happens next to the music they love. “I saw Jerry at least 30 times,” says Tom from Idaho. “Jerry was a huge part of the band, but some nights Jerry sucked.” Tom raves about Jeff Chimenti and his various activities, while a woman who has flown in from Ecuador, and who went out on the road with Lesh and Weir’s Furthur rather than with the Dead themselves, is not the only fan who proselytises about a new San Francisco band. They are called the Golden Gate Wingmen, and feature Chimenti alongside the redoubtable “Fake Jerry”, John Kadcelik. For many, it seems, the Fare Thee Well shows are not last rites so much as one more manifestation of a scene that is boundlessly complex and incestuous. A scene where founding fathers jam with young tyros and tribute bands; where one former Dead keyboardist – Tom Constanten, who served between 1968 and 1970 – was not recalled for Fare Thee Well, but currently figures in a long-established covers band called Jazz Is Dead. Where Phil Lesh And Friends frequently gather at Lesh’s own San Rafael club, Terrapin Crossroads, to replay entire Dead shows from the archives. The scene is rooted in the past, but it understands how gifted improvising musicians can find infinite possibilities in a small constellation of songs. In this telling of the story, the mass impact of Fare Thee Well is a glitch that will pass soon enough, and leave the true believers to get on with its long, involved, compelling business. David Browne begins So Many Roads with a wondering assessment of the band from Carolyn ‘Mountain Girl’ Garcia, the Merry Prankster who became Jerry Garcia’s wife. “How \u003c\u003edid\u003c\u003e they get together and relate to each other?” she ponders. “They really worked on it. They wanted it badly. They were glued to the enterprise.” The Grateful Dead may be formally over, but the enterprise, the songs, and many of the players – in whatever form they next manifest themselves – remain indefatigably alive. Trouble behind, as the old song goes, trouble ahead… Heads up!

What we had wasn’t a working blueprint for Utopia, but it was an unfolding better way of living, away from the safety net of a society that acts as either a sieve or a meat grinder. It was a different way of doing things. It had all the regular trappings and problems of society, but it offered hope.” A few hundred metres away, Santa Clara’s year-old Levi’s Stadium, normally home to the San Francisco 49ers, awaits today’s influx of 83,000 multifarious Deadheads. Lifers like Jeremy and Karen mingle with new young fans, and a great many middle-aged men and women whose love of the Dead has endured long after their own quests for Utopia have ended. Over the next two weekends, the four remaining core members of the Grateful Dead and their accomplices will play five Fare Thee Well shows, two here and three in Chicago, which will reportedly net $40 million in ticket sales alone. Out in the parking lots, however, a more idiosyncratic brand of entrepreneurship is flourishing, even while cops patrol the aisles on golf buggies. This is Shakedown Street, storied hub of the grey economy that has long clustered around the Dead, an ad hoc marketplace for all your quainter hippy needs. Hash pipes proliferate, as do conch shells and vegetarian burritos. There are drum circles, hackysack players, dogs in bandannas, and t-shirt memorials to Brent Mydland, one of the multiple keyboard players who died during the Grateful Dead’s original lifespan between 1965 and 1995. A large man loudly advertises the hash brownies that he is selling, neatly packaged in branded plastic containers. Another wanders through the crowds, carrying a mysterious box labelled “Take a gift”. Jeremy, though, has a living to make. The day Jerry Garcia died, Tuesday August 9, 1995, he postponed thoughts of getting a job for a good 24 hours. The next day he found work at the University of Santa Cruz, but soon took to the road again, selling his tie-dyes at festivals through the summers, until it became harder and harder to survive the winters. Finally, he had an idea; America’s only make-your-own tie-dye store, A Brighter World. “Jeremy’s one of the few people who made it,” says Karen. “Everybody had their little things – I crocheted crazy stuff to get me across the country – but he actually turned it into a business. People who can combine the hippy thing with a work ethic, they can find a really interesting way to live.” Jeremy claims he is mostly here to promote his business. After several hundred shows, though, a profound emotional attachment to the Dead remains, transcending his cynicism over the premise of Fare Thee Well, and his scepticism that the band can still be meaningful without Garcia. “I just hope they play like it’s their last one, as opposed to going through the motions,” he finally decides. “It could be like going to someone’s house for a home-cooked meal but they got sick, so they ordered out. It’s OK, but I hope it won’t be like that…” Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… Last May, Bill Kreutzmann published Deal, an autobiography of his time playing drums in the Grateful Dead. It’s a pretty rough book, and one that doesn’t add much to the accumulated weight of Dead scholarship, but it does encapsulate the band’s mix of nebulous Aquarian idealism and frontier machismo: besides the drugs and the jams, the reckless use of firearms played a key role in the band’s bonding rituals. It is also a book that must have been submitted to the printers before Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir and Mickey Hart decided to reactivate their band for this valedictory round of shows. At one point, Kreutzmann compares the Grateful Dead to an arch, that people would pass underneath en route to “a Utopian island where the gardens looked like amphitheatres, the mall looked like Shakedown Street and the houses were made out of tents.” “Jerry Garcia,” Kreutzmann continues, “was the keystone of this magical arch. You take that out, and not only does the arch come tumbling down, crushing all who are stuck beneath, but also, it crushes the only road that leads to that Utopian dream.” Later he articulates, with a bluntness that is more typical of his prose, the suspicions of many Dead fans following the announcement of Fare Thee Well: “The Grateful Dead without Jerry Garcia would be like the Miles David Quintet without Miles Davis… It’s a reenactment, nostalgia, mere bathos.” Kreutzmann’s get-out clause, as the first Fare Thee Well show draws near, is made clear on the ticket: this is not technically a Grateful Dead concert. In the 20 years since Garcia died, the surviving members have intermittently reconfigured themselves in different permutations – The Other Ones, Furthur, The Dead – to keep the music alive, and of course to keep the bank accounts healthy. For these last five gigs, however, the band name is delicately obscured. “Remember, it’s called ‘Fare Thee Well, Celebrating 50 Years Of The Grateful Dead’,” cautions the promoter Peter Shapiro, a couple of weeks before the show. “That’s how we branded it. Jerry was the soul of the band – they all know that, we all know that – but we’re gonna do it one more time.” The last time the “core four” came together was for a tour as The Dead, in 2009. “We’ve put the past behind us,” Mickey Hart told Uncut then, referring to the tensions that had dogged inter-band relations since Garcia’s death. “You can’t play Grateful Dead music with someone you don’t like.” Kreutzmann, though, recalls in Deal that the 2009 tour turned out to be so fractious that it “spelled the end of the Dead”. “The head trips,” he remembers, “were so monstrous… You’re doing it just to earn money and that’s not good enough. It doesn’t honour the music or the legacy.” Shapiro, a Deadhead with a long history of working with the bandmembers individually, ruefully admits the business of reuniting the quartet involved “some good reverse jiu-jitsu”. Lesh, at 75 the oldest of the survivors, appears to have been pivotal to the process, reportedly refusing to countenance a full tour (rumours persist that Weir, Kreutzmann and Hart will head out, with John Mayer, for more dates later in the year). Since the shows were announced in January, every one of Shapiro’s decisions has been critiqued by the fans, from his ticketing schemes to his choice of venues: Soldier Field in Chicago is where Garcia played his last concert, and Kreutzmann recalls waking the heroin-addicted guitarist from a doze in the middle of that decidedly non-vintage set. Most controversially, there has been the selection of a stand-in for Garcia. Warren Haynes, who subbed on guitar in 2009 and who also spent many years filling in for Duane Allman in The Allman Brothers, missed the cut this time. John Kadcelik, who graduated from Dead tribute bands to join Weir and Lesh in Furthur, was evidently disqualified in order to maintain a fragile band entente: Kreutzmann pointedly disparages him as “Fake Jerry” in Deal. The lucky guitarist is Trey Anastasio, the frontman of Phish. For many years, Phish have had a precarious reputation in the pantheon of jam bands as the Dead’s most obvious heirs: a group whose huge popularity is enhanced, not diminished, by the digressive intricacy of their music. The analogy is not a precise one, though, and Phish’s credibility with Dead fans has long been compromised by their propensity for a certain prog wackiness, and the fact that Anastasio is as indebted to Frank Zappa as he is to Jerry Garcia. The size of Phish’s following, and his apparent lack of political baggage with all four Dead survivors, make Anastasio a pragmatic choice, but Shapiro is enthusiastic about his diligence as much as his improvising skills. Anastasio has been preparing for six months, employing a Broadway orchestrator to write out charts of around 100 songs from the Dead catalogue. “Trey’s not only been studying Jerry,” says Shapiro, “he’s been studying the people Jerry studied.” “Trey has been kicking ass,” Jeff Chimenti, organist in the Fare Thee Well lineup, tells Uncut during the band’s uncharacteristically focused, “very busy” rehearsal period. “He’s worked hard and it’s evident in his performance, besides the ‘position’ in the band that he has to deal with, so to speak…I’m sure you know what I mean…” According to Dennis McNally, the band’s former publicist and the author of their definitive history, A Long Strange Trip, Anastasio is “a lovely guy, and a fine guitarist, and I think he will do as good a job as anybody could. I think he’s smart enough not to try to sound like Jerry. But part of me sort of feels sorry for him because, y’know, what a job…” Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… Forty-three miles from San Francisco, Santa Clara does not feel quite like a spiritual home of The Grateful Dead. Larry Livermore, who saw the Dead at least 25 times before becoming a key player in the Bay Area punk scene and discovering Green Day, describes the city as “basically the Milton Keynes of Silicon Valley”. “I saw them in many places; parks, dancehalls, at Woodstock,” he says, “but I think I might have drawn the line at Santa Clara.” This, though, is more or less where the Dead began, growing up in nearby Palo Alto and working their way through local pizza restaurants and music stores until Ken Kesey’s acid tests led them into San Francisco itself. In David Browne’s new Dead biography, So Many Roads, he describes a night in 1962 when Jorma Kaukonen, soon to form Jefferson Airplane, arrived at Santa Clara College from his home in Washington DC. On Kaukonen’s first day on campus, Browne writes, “he wandered into a folk club and met Garcia and a young, throat-shredding Texas transplant named Janis Joplin.” In the intervening 50-odd years, much has changed in the area. “When Jerry was growing up, what is now Silicon Valley was all fruit groves,” says Dennis McNally. “In the Dead’s lifetime, it has become one of the economic engines of America and, in fact, the world. It encapsulates the history of the last 50 years, 75 years.” Bucolic hippy innocence, evolving into digital idealism, maturing to technocratic capitalism in its most intense form: it’s a neat summary of the journey undertaken by at least some of the Dead’s followers. The band’s fans were early mainstays of online messageboards, while Steve Jobs and his partner at Apple, Steve Wozniak, McNally notes, were formative Deadheads (Wozniak promoted an ’80s festival headlined by the Dead; Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell, is reportedly present at the Santa Clara show). It’s a transformation that some will also see as of a piece with the mainstream compromises made by the Dead in the latter stages of their career, and by the organisers of Fare Thee Well. The Levi’s Stadium, for instance, is not the most idyllic of venues. When the band had growth spurts in the mid-’70s and ’80s, however, such vast spaces became their home for most of the summer months. “Jerry once complained about playing a stadium show because he felt he had to make the music cartoonish,” says McNally. “Very broad gestures. I remember a band meeting in December 1985, in which the band sat and agreed, rather stonily and with some regret, that they would have to do stadium shows because of the demand. It was not a joyful decision.” Kreutzmann, true to form, is equally sceptical in Deal, complaining about how the lack of nuance in stadium shows made them “safe… and safe equals boring.” Ominously, he also takes some perverse pride in listing all the significant gigs that his band messed up through their original career. “Just like at Monterey Pop and all the other big shows,” he writes, referring to their performance at Woodstock, “the Grateful Dead blew it.” Back at the tie-dye stall on Shakedown Street, however, Karen is philosophical: “Yeah, we all wish they’d done it the old way where the tour ‘Heads got the first shot at the tickets, we all wish it was a smaller venue. We’re all gonna complain and bitch, but this is all we’re gonna get. Part of me thinks we should all just shut up and get over it.” Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… Above the Levi’s Stadium, a plane makes repeated attempts to draw a peace sign with its vapour trail. Inside, one concourse has been given over to Participation Row, where stalls represent a motley collection of charities and pressure groups sanctioned by Dead members. At its furthest extreme the action is especially interesting, with representatives of MAPS – the Multidisciplinary Association For Psychedelic Studies, who advocate for the psychotherapeutic use of LSD and MDMA in treating life-threatening illnesses – positioned right next to the Owsley Stanley Foundation. “Bear” Stanley’s home-made acid fuelled the psychedelic revolution in San Francisco, but it is his work as the Dead’s soundman, and as someone who recorded over a thousand concerts by everyone from Miles Davis to Doc Watson, that the Foundation promotes, raising funds to digitally preserve his disintegrating tape archive. On the field inside the Stadium, the amateur tapers have, as tradition dictates, a demarcated area for them to record the show. As Radiohead’s “House Of Cards” fades, however, and the seven-piece band amble on and slope into a loose, jazzy jam, even the most assiduous fans might be hard pressed to identify the song with which the Grateful Dead begin Fare Thee Well. Five minutes in, a shape emerges. This is “Truckin'”, a chemically-enhanced road choogle from 1970’s American Beauty, and a rare anthem in a catalogue that is mostly too imaginative and devious to make such obvious moves. Bob Weir is singing Garcia’s old part, and while Anastasio is grinning so broadly that it seems he can barely believe his luck, his playing is commendably unostentatious. Much of the fancier work, in fact, is done by the two keyboardists: pianist Bruce Hornsby, who took time off from his solo career to become a floating Dead member in the early ’90s; and Chimenti, a longtime associate of Lesh and Weir, who is apparently playing Brent Mydland’s old Hammond B3. “Truckin'” provides a gentle opening to a show that stretches over four and a half hours, including an hour-long interval, and features 17 songs – none of which were originally recorded any later than 1970. The first set gradually builds up speed, taking in a frail and lovely “Uncle John’s Band”, admittedly a little more Margaritaville than Wild West honky-tonk, before gaining momentum after 40 minutes with a wonderful “Cumberland Blues”. There are beautifully-evoked flashbacks to the band’s dancehall roots, baroque psychedelic grooves like “Alligator” and “Born Cross-Eyed”. Perhaps best and most unexpected of all, Anastasio pilots a scything take on “Cream Puff War”, a rarity from their eponymous ’67 debut that’s been neglected by the band for the past 48 years and that, had it not been so thoroughly overshadowed by what came after, might now be regarded as a garage nugget to match Love’s “7 And 7 Is”. At the climax of “Viola Lee Blues”, in the most elevating jam of the first half, and on the weekend that the United States legalise gay marriage, a perfect rainbow appears above the stage. It is all, perhaps, too good to be true. Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… Before the show begins, Karen from the tie-dye stall tries to explain how the Dead crowd became factionalised in the mid-’80s, when an influx of unruly younger fans brought new levels of chaos and disruption to the band’s shows and generally “pissed off everyone”. “We weren’t here to get wasted,” she says. “We were here to see the shows and the whole LSD thing was part of the experience. We didn’t make people mad in small towns. We knew not to sleep downtown, not to panhandle, not to drag our dirty puppies through restaurants. “The best quote I ever heard was, ‘It used to be a zoo of a kind, now it’s kind of a zoo.’ It was said by one of my friends, tripping in the middle of the night. I think,” she laughs, “his name was Wind.” The day after, a couple of miles from the stadium, I meet a dishevelled twentysomething who is a kind of millennial equivalent of the people Karen described. He has only grubby socks on his feet, and is begging because he is “desperate for a pair of shoes for tonight’s show.” The events that befell him after the previous night’s concert are, to say the least, unclear, and he has no idea where his friends are or where he is meant to be staying. Throughout it all, though, he has held on to his skateboard, and to a cache of “really good LSD I’m trying to get rid of”. With a very old solution to a very modern problem, he offers acid in exchange for the use of a cellphone charger. It would be churlish, of course, to see his behaviour as dishonouring the drug etiquette of vintage Deadheads. Tom, from Idaho, is a veteran of 50-odd shows by the Dead and their offshoots, and first saw the band at the massive Watkins Glen show in 1973, when they shared a bill with the Allman Brothers and The Band in front of 600,000 people. Tom drove down to Watkins Glen from Boston, and remembers it as “one of the wildest times of my life. I was doing meth and peyote. I was 18, with nine friends, we were nuts. By the time we went home there were only three of us left, the rest of them we lost. They couldn’t handle it, they had to get the fuck out. It was mayhem; overwhelming.” At 9.40, the atmosphere for the evening’s second set is sensational. Traditionally, the latter half of Dead shows privileged the more expansive and exploratory side of their art, and tonight is no exception. After a prologue of “Cryptical Envelopment” – quaveringly sung by Phil Lesh in a voice that, for all its weathered charisma, remains mostly unsuitable for fronting a rock band – the literal and metaphorical fireworks begin. “Dark Star” was established as the Dead’s signature jam in 1968, and tonight’s 30-minute version is a bracing reiteration of the band’s uncanny chemistry. In So Many Roads, David Browne describes a “Dark Star” from November 1969. He writes of how Lesh, with his wildly ambulatory basslines, briefly appeared to be “wrestling for control of the song,” before “Garcia would take command but then retreat back into the song’s haze… Lesh wouldn’t be steering ‘Dark Star’ for long,” Browne observes. “In fact, no one would.” Trey Anastasio is, as discussed, no Jerry Garcia. As the 2015 “Dark Star” unravels, however, his discretion acts as a useful analogue for the slippery ways in which Garcia subverted his role of lead guitarist. Like the best Dead jams, all the elements – Anastasio’s sculpted leads and Weir’s impressionistic rhythm guitar flecks, the two percolating drummers, the two elegantly interpretive keyboardists – seem to be on their own trajectories: following orbits which only occasionally intersect; untethered by anything remotely resembling an orthodox bassline. Its success seems more down to chance than traditional musical logic and, if Anastasio succeeds at anything tonight, it is in insinuating himself into such a mystifyingly intuitive unit. At times like this, the Dead’s ability to hold the attention of nearly 100,000 people while playing radically weird music, remains astonishing. The traditional “Drums \u003e Space” jam is an especial challenge, beginning with Kreutzmann and Hart methodically working round several dozen percussion instruments, and progressing through a kind of tribal techno that is, perhaps unwittingly, reminiscent of a Spiral Tribe or Megadog rave in the early ’90s. When their bandmates return for the “Space” improvisation, Anastasio finally slips in some of the prog quackery that makes much of the Phish canon a hard sell to those averse to such whimsical excess. It is, though, a rare indulgence on Anastasio’s part. Discipline isn’t something traditionally associated with continuous jams that last for nearly two and a half hours, but this is the prevailing mood of the second set, and its two magnificent highlights. First there is “St Stephen”, euphorically punching its way out of the skronk. Then, at the end, there is Bonnie Dobson’s “Morning Dew”, originally attempted by the band on their debut album, and here essayed with a bluesy grace and spaciousness that feels restrained even when Anastasio lets his notes hang and arc in the air, and Bob Weir, lugubrious in trademark shorts and sandals, pushes his hearty but limited voice as far as it will possibly go. Finally, Hornsby leads them through one more of the homespun singalongs from Workingman’s Blues, “Casey Jones”. Apposite quotes for most occasions leap out of the discography of any band with a long career. The Grateful Dead are no exception, with a rich catalogue – mostly written by Garcia’s old friend, Robert Hunter – that presents risk, fate and mortality as part of some picaresque outlaw adventure. The refrain of “Casey Jones”, though – “Trouble ahead, trouble behind” – feels particularly useful. For all the stage-managed finality of Fare Thee Well, this is very much an ongoing story. Heads up! Next month’s Uncut – on sale July 28 in the UK – comes with a FREE GRATEFUL DEAD CD: our historic attempt to piece together the album that should have followed “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty”… Over the next four shows, the band play 68 more songs from every phase of their career, only repeating two (“Cumberland Blues” and, not unreasonably, “Truckin'”). The phrase “Greatest American Band” is thrown around a lot, and Barack Obama sends his regards. The first night rainbow is investigated at length, and initial stories that it was a son et lumiere stunt appear to be discounted. The general feeling mixes exhilaration with qualified relief: perhaps Phil Lesh sang a little more often than necessary; perhaps the pace dragged now and again; maybe the setlists ranged far and wide in a way that only someone attending all five nights could really appreciate. Nevertheless, consensus suggests Anastasio nailed his seemingly impossible brief and, for once, the Grateful Dead didn’t screw up the big shows. It’s hard to portray the whole Fare Thee Well project as anything other than a lucratively nostalgic endeavour, with its attendant live streams, cinema screenings, imminent commemorative boxsets and so forth; as one last trip for the baby boomer generation, and for those successive generations who dreamed of being a part of it. At the first night in Santa Clara, though, the crowd is celebratory rather than sentimental, and pragmatically informed about what happens next to the music they love. “I saw Jerry at least 30 times,” says Tom from Idaho. “Jerry was a huge part of the band, but some nights Jerry sucked.” Tom raves about Jeff Chimenti and his various activities, while a woman who has flown in from Ecuador, and who went out on the road with Lesh and Weir’s Furthur rather than with the Dead themselves, is not the only fan who proselytises about a new San Francisco band. They are called the Golden Gate Wingmen, and feature Chimenti alongside the redoubtable “Fake Jerry”, John Kadcelik. For many, it seems, the Fare Thee Well shows are not last rites so much as one more manifestation of a scene that is boundlessly complex and incestuous. A scene where founding fathers jam with young tyros and tribute bands; where one former Dead keyboardist – Tom Constanten, who served between 1968 and 1970 – was not recalled for Fare Thee Well, but currently figures in a long-established covers band called Jazz Is Dead. Where Phil Lesh And Friends frequently gather at Lesh’s own San Rafael club, Terrapin Crossroads, to replay entire Dead shows from the archives. The scene is rooted in the past, but it understands how gifted improvising musicians can find infinite possibilities in a small constellation of songs. In this telling of the story, the mass impact of Fare Thee Well is a glitch that will pass soon enough, and leave the true believers to get on with its long, involved, compelling business. David Browne begins So Many Roads with a wondering assessment of the band from Carolyn ‘Mountain Girl’ Garcia, the Merry Prankster who became Jerry Garcia’s wife. “How \u003c\u003edid\u003c\u003e they get together and relate to each other?” she ponders. “They really worked on it. They wanted it badly. They were glued to the enterprise.” The Grateful Dead may be formally over, but the enterprise, the songs, and many of the players – in whatever form they next manifest themselves – remain indefatigably alive. Trouble behind, as the old song goes, trouble ahead… Heads up!

    "DiffbotBody": "The Legal Metrology department has issued a notice to Runwal Builders for allegedly not giving residents of a Thane building the flat sizes they were originally promised The Legal Metrology department of the state has issued a notice to a top builder for allegedly not giving home buyers the area they had been promised in their flats. Thane’s Legal Metrology department issued the notice to Runwal Builders earlier this week, after it found that the carpet area of the 3BHK flat in its Runwal Pearl project, Thane (West), wasn’t what was detailed in the agreement. According to R Dalvi, a senior officer from the Metrology department, Thane, the notice was issued earlier this week to the builder, seeking his reply on the same. “We received complaints from members of the building Runwal Pearl and found their complaint to be legitimate, and hence we have issued the notice to the builder,” said Dalvi. On June 25, the members of the building had submitted a complaint to the Legal Metrology department, claiming that the area of the house that they had been given was not what the builder had promised. A team from the department visited the houses in the society and found out that the flats were only around 875 sq ft in area (each room was 71.38 sq metres and the attached balcony was 10.04 sq meters, making up 81.42 sq metres, or 876.4 sq ft, in all), compared to the 935 sq ft allegedly promised by the builder. Going flat out According to sources, most of the residents had moved to the building in 2012, and many then realised that the area given wasn’t the one offered in the agreement. They then corresponded with the builder several times, to no avail. “The members of the society heard that the Legal Metrology department can help them measure the flat and the ratified measurement also is a legal document. The department, when it measured the flat, found that the measurement was lower than promised. Earlier this week, the department sent the notice to the builder seeking his reply,” said a source. None of the residents in the building wished to comment on the issue and claimed that they do not wish to speak about it and have done whatever they had to do. However, the issue they have with the measurement done by the metrology department is that, the flat area calculated by the department includes even the balcony, which many claim isn’t part of the carpet area, and hence shouldn’t be added to the size of the flat. Even with the addition, the flat size is lower than promised. If no response is received from the builder within the stipulated time period, the Legal Metrology department files a complaint with the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, and takes the matter ahead legally. The other side Sandeep Runwal of Runwal Builders said, “There was no notice given to us before the legal metrology department carried out the measurement. Also, measurements were carried out four years after handing over possession; people must have carried out alterations. We do not know how the measurement has been done, we have given more area; our plans have been passed by the Thane Municipal Corporation. Why was the measurement done in our absence? The law of natural justice hasn’t been followed.” He added, “What I have been told is the usable area is more than what the home buyers were supposed to receive. Still they are raising issues. If they feel the carpet area is less, then the TMC officials should have also been called for the measurement.” What was promised \u003e\u003e A 3BHK apartment of 935 sq ft \u003e\u003e Actual flat size as per the Legal Metrology department’s measurement* is 876.4 sq ft (*This measurement also includes the balcony)",

    "DiffbotBody": "Ships. Opium chests. Choppy waters. Warring continents. Flood of Fire, the much-awaited finale to the Ibis Trilogy is packed with all of the above, and much more. Recently, Amitav Ghosh gave Mumbai fans a taste of this heady adventure. Fiona Fernandez met with him to get the back-story of his epic work of historic fiction George Wittet's Gateway of India has a grey hue to it. After all, it's pouring outside. The monsoon is here, we're told. Call it timing or otherwise; we couldn't help but imagine similar brushstrokes paint a vivid picture from 1839-40, in the torrential waters around south China — the area where Amitav Ghosh's Flood of Fire ends in fine form. \"Yes, River of Smoke was launched around this time, too,\" smiles Ghosh when we remind him of the monsoon connect. Our introductions revisited, we are ready to set sail. Pun intended. \"I love being on water,\" when we prod early on, about why a ship forms such an integral part to the trilogy. \"It's such a wonderful thing to write about. It provides you with classical elements like time, place and action. So much can happen in a concentration of space. No wonder Agatha Christie wrote several titles centred on ships,\" he says, with a twinkle in his eye. Despite a packed, superhit launch (Aamir Khan was in the audience) the previous (Friday) evening, there's no trace of fatigue. This, even if we were to factor in an engaging one-hour interaction (Meeting Amitav Ghosh) with nine mid-day readers, barely an hour earlier. Easing into the conversation, he's happy with the way the Ibis Trilogy turned out. \"As I came to the end, it felt satisfying. I am glad with the way it worked itself out. I felt as if I was taking dictation from the book! It was on its own track,\" he quips, to which I ask, \"…like a boatman?\" Ghosh agrees, and we can gauge sea connect. Little wonder then, that when we speak a few moments later about the wondrous mix of languages and dialects in the trilogy, he shares about how nautical language was easy to incorporate — \"I grew up in Sri Lanka, where it's spoken freely. Sri Lanka (Ceylon) was an important stop for wayfarers and traders. Interestingly, I came across similar phraseology in Mauritius as well,\" he elaborates, helping me join the dots. By now, we're soaked in a socio-cultural lesson. The interview must make a re-entry, we realise, before our scheduled time slot runs out. Of characters and challenges So, we ask Ghosh to pick favourites from the trilogy. With a bunch of eclectic, insightful characters, each with their set of quirks, \"It's tough for me,\" he grins. \"They've all been difficult to create. A short pause later, he reveals, \"Bahram Modi was a great challenge. He was a businessman from Bombay who was dealing with opium. I had to enter a world that I was not accustomed to. It was a rewarding experience, especially from a sympathetic standpoint. In fact, he was the second character (Deeti was the first) that I thought of, when I began work on the trilogy. He has a very vivid presence, and is one of the most interesting characters in my entire writing life.\" When we nudge a bit, on whether he missed Bahram in the final book, he adds, \"He was there in spirit. But his wife Shireen was an interesting character as well. It's easy to relate to her, isn't it?\" As we carry on our discussion of the book's central characters — Mr and Mrs Burnham, Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesri and Neel, it's insightful to listen to (and read, earlier) the wizardry with which the reader goes on a seamless ride that pans continents and cultures, separated by water. \"How do you manage to balance the pace of one story such that it doesn't outdo the other?\" we quiz the Kolkata-born author. \"Well, I wish I had the answer!\" he shrugs, sharing a grin. \"At some basic level, it's about instinct. Besides, while working on such a long book, one cannot merely depend on the flow.\" Anybody who has read the trilogy will vouch for the imagery that takes over almost immediately. Like it did in our case. So when talk veers to these intrinsic elements to his craft, he replies, \"I think in a visual way. To be able to write a scene, I need to see it. It's the best compliment if my reader can also do this, while reading it.\" This, we were able to — from the moment we walked into our interview, forty minutes earlier, when dark clouds gathered over the Arabian Sea, in the picture postcard-like view from the hotel window. Just as Ghosh had imagined, possibly, when Bahram, and later, Shireen had set sail, as they stood on the threshold of rewriting their destinies. Quick bites On sailing the seas: I love to head out on sail ships. Most recently, my wife and I did this wonderful trip on an Indonesian cruise called Bugis Schooners. These cruise boats were originally made by a seafaring community called the Bugis. I found it was fascinating to experience Indonesia via water, what with thousands of islands that one encounters along the way. This included a visit to the Komodo Islands too, where we were greeted by many Komodo Dragons! On mastering languages: (laughs) I'm familiar with English, Bengali and Hindi, of course. Then, there's Arabic, and also Bhojpuri, which I learnt from my father who lived in those parts. This helped while writing Kesri's story. As for the language of the boat people, I researched from the archives in China. What's next? There are two non-fiction works. One of these is based on the research that emerged from the trilogy. The second will be based on a series of lectures that I conducted back in the United States. Climate change matters: What I would like to see is large-scale renewable energy sources that are easily possible and available in India. Instead of subsidising gas and power, why not offer subsidies for solar panels? After all, India is blessed with adequate sunlight. This strikes me most viscerally. Even in my home in Goa, I've tried to install solar panels, but have been plagued by so many obstacles. (Amitav Ghosh is a leading world voice who speaks on environmental issues and impact of climate change) Will there be a TV or film series based on the ibis trilogy? Yes, people have approached me in the past. But I don't think about it (smiles). Meeting Amitav Ghosh Malabi Das, one of the nine mid-day readers who participated in a Meet the Author contest held by the newspaper, won her a chance to interact with Amitav Ghosh yesterday. She narrates the experience The Ibis trilogy is complete; the Flood of Fire is on the stands; and, I am going to meet Amitav Ghosh! I could hardly believe it. And, there I was shaking hands with him; sharing a table with a bunch of very informed fans of the celebrated author. I went to the reader's session with Amitav without any expectation, but I came out smiling like a cat who got the cream. Did you know that Amitav Ghosh writes his first draft with a pencil on a sketch pad and the second draft with pen on ruled paper? And that he probably writes 30-40 drafts by the time his novel was done? In the warm, friendly atmosphere of the Business Centre at the Taj Mahal Hotel, Ghosh let us peep into his world — the world of Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesari, Shireen Modi, and Neel. So, how did he go about completing this colossal project — how did he handle the enormous historical data and weave it into these amazing works of fiction? \"Writing is like mediation. Every morning I sit on my writing desk and let my mind calm down, till it is like still water, and then I start to write,\" explains Amitav. Now that the Ibis trilogy is complete what can we expect from Amitav's desk next? It may not be another work of fiction for some time, but we can look forward to some non-fiction that he is currently working on. I must admit, I like his non-fiction as much as I enjoy his works of fiction. Thank you, mid-day! Signing off to return to my autographed copy of Flood of Fire (I am abandoning my copy on Kindle in favour of the hardbound courtesy, mid-day and Penguin Random House.)",

A surveillance video appeared to capture the 22-year-old Grande licking the pastries - which were wrongfully displayed on the counter. Then, when another tray appeared, the appalled waif said, \"What the f--- is that? I hate Americans. I hate America.

ROME — Italian police said on Wednesday they had seized assets worth $2.2 billion and issued 41 arrest warrants in raids on gambling companies in Italy and abroad run by the 'Ndrangheta mafia organization. Police believe the firms, including six that were operating out of Malta, were used to launder vast sums of illicit cash. Italy's mafia groups, including the 'Ndrangheta from the southern region of Calabria, the Camorra from Naples and Sicily's Cosa Nostra, have strengthened their grip on southern Italy's economy and spread to the richer north during a three-year economic slump. Among the targets of Wednesday's operation were 1,500 betting shops, 82 gambling websites, 45 Italian companies and 11 foreign firms, as well as \"innumerable\" property assets, the financial police said in a statement. Apart from the firms run from Malta, two were in Spain, two in Romania and one in Austria. The Calabrian mafia has grown rich on the drugs trade, becoming one of Europe's biggest importers of South American cocaine, with strong ties to Mexican and Colombian cartels. It also runs companies in sectors including trucking and hospitality, with a stranglehold on the economy of Calabria, where unemployment is above 20%.",

    "LabBody": "From EatingWell: May/June 2015 This healthy popcorn shrimp recipe uses tiny shrimp to make crunchy bites perfect for popping in your mouth. We also swap out mayo-based tartar sauce for a healthier Greek yogurt dip flavored with Thai chili sauce. Makes: 4 servings. Serving Size: about 16 shrimp \u0026 3 Tbsp. sauce. Active Time: 25 minutes. Total Time: 25 minutes. Ingredients. 2 large eggs. 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning. 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided. 1 1/4 cups panko breadcrumbs. 1 pound peeled and deveined raw shrimp (50-70 count; see Tip) Canola oil cooking spray. 1/2 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt or reduced-fat sour cream. 1/4 cup Thai sweet chili sauce. 1 teaspoon sriracha or other hot sauce. Preparation. Position rack in bottom of oven; preheat to 450°F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Whisk eggs, Old Bay, garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl. Place breadcrumbs in another shallow bowl or dish. Add shrimp to the egg mixture and stir until well coated. Transfer to the breadcrumbs with a slotted spoon and gently stir to coat. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Generously coat with cooking spray. Bake the shrimp until cooked through and browned on the bottom, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, combine yogurt (or sour cream), chili sauce, hot sauce and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Serve the shrimp with the dipping sauce. Tips \u0026 Notes. Shrimp is usually sold by the number needed to make one pound. For example, “21-25 count” means there will be 21 to 25 shrimp in a pound. Size names, such as “large” or “extra large,” are not standardized, so to get the size you want, order by the count per pound. Both wild-caught and farm-raised shrimp can damage the surrounding ecosystems when not managed properly. Fortunately, it is possible to buy shrimp that have been raised or caught with sound environmental practices. Look for fresh or frozen shrimp certified by an independent agency, such as the Marine Stewardship Council. If you can’t find certified shrimp, choose wild-caught shrimp from North America—it’s more likely to be sustainably caught. Nutrition.

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "News Photos Local News Rails to Trails Local Rotary Clubs banded together to get a grant and build a pavillion on the Tweetsie Trail, near the three-mile mark. (Tony Casey/Johnson City Press) Members of the Tweetsie Trail task force are confident they can hold to their goal of having the 10-mile multi-use recreational trail completed by Labor Day weekend, but, as is the case with many projects that don’t include funds from state and federal governments, an injection of cash is needed. That’s why chairman Dr. Dan Schumaier and his team have sent out mailers to potential Elizabethton- and Carter County-area donors, asking for a financial shot in the arm that can help the task force get the final three miles of the trail surfaced and completed. “Elizabethton is coming right along,” Schumaier said. “There’s a lot of excitement surround the trail and it’s doing well.” Some of that excitement recently came with the announcement of two sizable donations that help cut into the estimated $50,000 needed to finish out the project. $10,000 came from the Carter County Bank and another $5,000 was donated by Bill Greene. It hasn’t ended there. Schumaier said he just tallied another $1,000 donation from one of the mailers and he expects more to come in to fill that $34,000 void before the first week of September. As well as asking for donations, the task force is organizing what will be a yearly event: a golf tournament that will include Johnson City commissioner Jenny Brock and golf professionals from both Johnson City and Elizabethton. Currently, the trail, which starts at Alabama Street in Johnson City, is completed into Carter County and Elizabethton, with grading and blue crushed stone chat in place through Holly Street, which sits across from Pal’s. Task force member Ken Gough says all right-of-ways through downtown Elizabethton are cleared for the trail to come through. Big John’s Closeouts, which spans both sides of the trail at 238 E. Elk Ave., initially had a dumpster and fencing that impeded passage, as the trail, a former railroad line, had not been in use in some years. The businesses owner and trail organizers came to an agreement allowing traffic through the business’ lot. “It’s going to go right through,” Gough said. “He accepts it and will make the best of the situation.” There’s still one small bridge needed for the last section, but Gough said Johnson City’s Director of Public Works Phil Pindzola already has that project mapped out. Gough, who lives on the Elizabethton side of the trail, said everything is going as well as it possibly could heading into the final months. A official opening ceremony is planned for the Labor Day, but the details haven’t been ironed out just yet. Schumaier said it won’t be the kind of event where something is happening in just one place. “It’s going to be all along the trail,” he said. “There are going to be activities going on up and down the trail.” One of the prime spots for these activities will be near the newly completed Rotary Club pavilion, which can be found just before the three-mile mark from the Johnson City side. Next to the quarry owned by the Grindstaff family, the site has a shelter bearing the Rotary symbol and a nearby bicycle rack. Just up the trail from the bicycle rack is an amphitheater with benches. Schumaier said the circle will be the perfect spot for an instructor to conduct an outside class. Signage is being put up to share information compiled by students and staff at East Tennessee State University that will teach about various topics from identifying birds to observing plant life and geological formations along the trail. “We’ve got a lot of stuff going on,” the chairperson said. “It’s awesome.” To make a donation or learn more about the trail, go to www.tweetsietrail.com.

Every four years, the GOP evaluates presidential hopefuls to determine who will be the presidential nominee, who will have a show on Fox News and who will be doing TV commercials for reverse mortgages. Comment It’s that time again. Every four years, the GOP evaluates presidential hopefuls to determine who will be the presidential nominee, who will have a show on Fox News and who will be doing TV commercials for reverse mortgages. So many candidates are running this time that the Republican debates won’t have room for a moderator on stage. Instead, they will need the fire marshal to OK having that many folks in the building. Here is my early take on the candidates: Given his libertarian roots, Rand Paul has the best appeal to broaden the GOP’s base. He is truly for minimal government and has set himself apart from the war hawks in his party. He took a principled stand on the NSA snooping on us, protecting the Fourth Amendment. Anytime you make both Democrats and establishment Republicans angry, you have probably done something right. Paul must win the New Hampshire primary to get early traction. He won’t win in Iowa, since he does not favor calling out the National Guard to arrest gays wanting to marry. Over half of Republicans are OK with gay marriage; the rest are running for president. Libertarian Paul approves legalizing pot and not prosecuting prostitutes. At a minimum, he will have the best post-election party. One glitch: His social media adviser had to quit when a Washington newspaper called Rand a secessionist (which I like). It all began on his Facebook page. When asked what country he is from, Paul’s answer was “It’s complicated.” I like Scott Walker second. He can appeal to Reagan Democrats and blue-collar Midwesterners. He is proven and experienced at beating back overreaching public sector unions. Next, Marco Rubio. His is a great American story, and he’s likable. He’ll appeal to the burgeoning Hispanic community. The leftist media struggle to take shots at him. Then, there is the leader in the clubhouse, Jeb Bush. He’d be fine, but we can do better. Also running: • Lindsey Graham. If elected, he would be the first bachelor president in the White House since Bill Clinton. He has subpoenaed Hillary Clinton to testify to his Senate committee several times, once giving her only a week’s notice – barely enough time for her to get a concussion. • Ted Cruz. One wonders if our nation is ready for a biracial, Harvard Law School graduate, one-term senator born in another country. Cruz futilely filibustered against Obamacare for 20 hours. Where was Kanye West when we really needed him? Hispanics Cruz and Rubio will have a real chance for impassioned pleas to the Latino community – you know, those people they are trying to deport. In their first moves as president, both vowed to deport themselves. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

The Louisiana governor will have a hard time raising money. I suggest he do it the New Orleans way: Lift your shirt, and show your breasts. Folks will throw money at you. • Rick Santorum, who won Iowa last time around, had “Santorum 2016” posters made. That is not only campaign material, it is also how many years he thinks the Earth has been around. He won’t settle for the VP nod because he thinks two men running together is gay. With the country becoming more secular, GOP candidates may not have to tack way to the right to get nominated. A Public Policy Polling survey concluded that God has only a 49 percent approval rating. He has declining numbers and is not trending well. Could we could be looking at a one-term God? All GOP candidates who want to win must appease evangelical Iowa and South Carolina voters, so they take the social conservative pledge: They will defend the rights of the unborn, right up to the point that they want to gay marry. The GOP has a deeper, sharper and more diverse field than the Democrats, including Carly Fiorina, Dr. Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio: a woman, an African American and two Hispanics. The party that preaches “diversity” has former Maryland Gov. O’Malley, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and Hillary Clinton. The only thing whiter than the Democratic candidates is a brunch.

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Daily Mail, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "Many Cambridge City Councilors say they feel rushed as they weigh in a Planning Board petition to amend the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center parcel in Kendall Square. The petition, a conceptual framework of what could be built on the parcel, proposes changes to the city’s PUD-KS District, which is mostly occupied by the Volpe site. The Planning Board and Ordinance Committee must vote on the petition, which will then go before the City Council. As part of the process, the city released three-dimensional models of four theoretical scenarios for the Volpe parcel, including a large 1,000-foot commercial tower. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the federal Department of Transportation are hoping to convert the existing 14-acre campus — composed of six buildings built in the 1960s and in need of major repairs and alterations — into a new state-of-the-art facility of up to 400,000 gross square feet for up to 1,300 personnel and parking spaces. GSA issued a request for information last August from developers interested in acquiring the land and expanding the development. The government is looking for a company to create a new home for the transportation center on Broadway, Third and Binney streets in exchange for ownership of a portion of the land. The part of the site — approximately three acres — that would remain under federal ownership would be designed and constructed in accordance to federal government standards. However, the approximate 11 acres conveyed out to exchange partners would be subject to Cambridge laws. The goal of the proposed petition is to set forth the zoning that would apply to the developer’s part of the process, according to Planning Board Chairman H. Theodore Cohen. “We’re setting up zoning for what we would like to see occur,” Cohen said on Monday at a joint Ordinance Committee and Planning Board meeting, adding that the Planning Board will likely make a recommendation to City Council at its next meeting on July 14. According to a letter from Cohen to the City Council, the proposed changes aim to implement zoning recommendations of the Kendall Square K2 Study, as well as objectives that have been discussed since the completion of the study. Under the petition, 10 percent of the total housing must be affordable and available to low- and moderate-income households, and five percent must be available to middle-income households. Some councilors, however, say 10 percent affordable housing just isn’t adequate. “Sometimes I feel that there are numbers that are put out there without backup,” Councilor Marc McGovern said. “I think we should be shooting for closer to 25 percent, certainly no less than 20. We’re getting 20 percent in other developments now.” » Comment or view comments",

We’re getting 20 percent in other developments now.” Planning Board members discussed having a requirement of up to 20 percent affordable units, but most members supported the minimum 10 percent stipulation, according to Cohen. Planning Board Vice-Chair Catherine Preston Connolly said board members wanted as much affordable housing as possible, but they were concerned about the high cost of the project. “The federal government requires that their new building be completely constructed, finished and move-in ready before you can take down the Volpe building,” Preston Connolly said. “They have to do that and have all the costs associated with building that before the developer can start anything [on the other parcel].” The Cambridge Residents Alliance feels the city must increase the proportion of residential to commercial units, according to Vice President Lee Farris. The group, Farris said, wants the maximum commercial space to be 40 percent instead of 60 percent. “Because Cambridge doesn’t have a lot of affordable housing and people are being displaced, it is unacceptable that the amount of affordable to low- and moderate-income housing would be reduced to 10 percent from 11.5 percent,” Farris said, adding that any increase above the current FAR (Floor Area Ratio) should go to housing. The petition requires retail and other active ground-floor space along major streets, with incentives for small retail spaces. But councilors want to see diverse ground-floor retail with affordable establishments that respect the neighborhood, such as supermarkets and mom-and-pop stores. “We have to meet the right language that gives us affordable retail,” Councilor Denise Simmons said. “There’s a feeling in the community that Kendall Square is for the intelligentsia of Cambridge and that Central Square is for the people that don’t have nine degrees behind their name and that shouldn’t be the feeling. We have to be very thoughtful and deliberate.” Open space. The current zoning calls for redevelopment of the site to include 7.5 acres of open space – more than half of the total acreage. The zoning also allows development at a 3.0 FAR. Therefore, large development parcels would be required to have a minimum of 40 percent of residential development, and at least 42 percent of the development parcel must be open space, including an area devoted to a public park. The petition, on the other hand, requests that at least 25 percent of the site (3.5 acres) be devoted to open space and five percent of the community space be allocated to innovation space, including startups. Several residents raised concerns about the open-space stipulation, including members of the East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) who said the city did not contact the group prior to drafting such an important petition. ECPT members also say the density of the development requires a major park, according to Jaquith. Councilors say they want open space and retail on the parcel to be a family/residential friendly space. Massing plans and three-dimensional models. The city recently released three-dimensional models of four theoretical scenarios for the Volpe parcel: two slender residential towers 350 feet and 500 feet high; one residential tower of up to 500 feet in height; three commercial towers, one 500 feet and two 350 feet tall; and one large commercial tower of 1,000 feet high. The city decided to model the latter after Councilor Leland Cheung suggested the Volpe site is the ideal location within the city to build a skyscraper 1,000-feet high. The model is not under consideration at the moment, according to the Community Development Department. “I’m comfortable with a tall building,” he said. “It’s really interesting to see when you lay it on the map how much more open space you can get if we consolidate the buildings rather than having several shorter buildings.” Councilor Dennis Carlone stressed the need to build a composition where buildings respect each other and tie the area together. He said the Planning Board must clearly define what they mean by “exceptional architectural quality” in the maximum building height section of the petition. Councilors voiced concerns about feeling rushed, except for Mayor David Maher who said he feels the redevelopment of the Volpe site is an exciting way to improve Kendall Square. “We have the opportunity to make it an even more exciting place with the addition of open space, more housing,” Maher said. “This is an opportunity for us to be able to create and to have place-making that makes good sense going forward without being under the gun of having a developer say, ‘It’s this or nothing.’” Councilors held the petition in committee and requested that the Planning Board prepare a memorandum addressing the issues raised at the meeting. The next hearing will likely be held in August, but an exact date has not been scheduled.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The actress demonstrates the perfect way to give your pretty white dress a little edge – or to transition it into cooler temps: by adding a military-inspired vest, sexy (and super tall) wedges and a cool suede bag. A simple concept (striped Madewell et Sézane tee, denim skirt, structured bag) gets taken to the next level with cool-girl touches like funky sunglasses and unexpected navy mules. Like many body-baring ensembles worn by J.Lo, we advise you to proceed with caution. But we can't help thinking that her cropped A.L.C. top, flirty ruffled Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent Exclusive for Intermix skirt and Barbara Bonner fringe bag are begging to be worn out at night somewhere tropical (or faux tropical – a tiki bar would do). A busy black-and-white print like the one on Lea's Zimmermann dress seems to call for a coordinating black or white pump. But how much more attention-getting is the look with a pair of strappy, multihued Jimmy Choo sandals? Wonder why we're always saying the combo of jeans and a great white T is the holy grail of outfits? Exhibit A: This photo of Beyoncé, whose perfectly-fitted look proves that all you need are red lips, red nails and some stylish sneakers (like her custom python pair from Taxidermy) for a look that's both chic and completely effortless. You can fight the '90s resurgence all you want, but Rachel is here to say it's here, it's happening, and it's time to get out your print babydoll dresses and chunky clogs (hers are Tory Burch). And maybe some brick-colored lipstick, while you're at it. Yes, the star's Elle Sasson chambray dress is super-charming, and yes, her Gucci bag should have been in our closet, like, yesterday, but at the moment, it's her whimsical Jason Polan for Soludos \"Burger and Fries\" smoking slippers that are giving us particular outfit envy. Your outfit inspiration awaits, courtesy of Jessica Alba, Jamie Chung, Jennifer Lopez and more stylish celebs The model's matched set from Twenty is the perfect blank canvas for any look, but we love her \"dressed down\" approach with her stacked Ash sneakers and Miu Miu glasses, plus a denim jacket for cooler temps. When we say \"double denim,\" you immediately think \"jean jacket and skinnies,\" right? But Emmy's evolving the look by topping a pair of J Brand boyfriend jeans with a chambray Gap halter, then adding classic CH Carolina Herrera accessories to balance out the tomboy effect. A summer sandal in basic black would be the obvious choice to go with Naomie's pretty print Burberry dress, which is why it's so noteworthy that she gave the whole look a twist with mirrored silver loafers and a matching Jimmy Choo clutch.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Sports Editor | Verona-Cedar Grove Times Print Zach gewelb/Staff Photographer While there are always kids to participate in summer sports, there are also always coaches to lead the way. There is a strong commitment needed to coach in the summer, a devotion that every coach has to be willing to make. Any coach who understands what summer coaching is about is more than willing to put in the time, according to those in the Verona and Cedar Grove areas. \"It's really all about giving an experience to these kids,\" Verona swim coach Nick Henning said. \"It's very important to give them the ability to have fun and at the same time learn something.\" Henning's thoughts were echoed by other coaches, as well. Cedar Grove's American Legion baseball coach Randy Nelson, Verona High School's head football coach Lou Racioppe and Cedar Grove's swim coach Maggie Coleman also mentioned that helping the kids improve is biggest goal of the summer seasons. \"I think it's a good thing because it's about helping the kids get ready for the next season,\" Nelson said, while Racioppe stated that \"it's really a different type of situation where you get to know the kids a little bit better.\" Coleman she said she is excited to work as a coach for the same team she was on while growing up. She said watching her former summer swimming coaches helped her decide to coach the swim team this summer and she hopes she can make a similar impact. \"It's pretty exciting for me,\" Coleman said. \"I like getting to know each kid and I love being around the sport and helping them do things they thought they couldn't do.\" Every sport requires a different method of coaching, especially in the summer seasons. In terms of football, Racioppe said there is little-to-no emphasis on the sport during the summer. \"We do very little football work over the summer,\" he said. \"We focus our summer workouts mainly on conditioning, weightlifting and running.\" While those three aspects of training do not include playing the sport, all three will help the players prepare for the fall season when winning and losing comes into play. Racioppe did say, however, that the team will compete in events to keep the players sharp, including 7-on-7 tournaments for the skill players and strongman competitions for the linemen. The events give the players an opportunity to display their hard work and conditioning. While the competitions and tournaments can be fun, the Verona coach said he tries to keep everything low-key during the summer. \"We monitor the kids over the summer to see how they're improving,\" Racioppe said, noting that workouts are four days per week and last about two hours every day. While Racioppe maintains a steady workout schedule for his players, he said there are always going to be kids who can't make it to practice due to other commitments, a problem that every summer coach has to deal with, including Nelson. \"We don't practice,\" he said. \"At this time of the year, we don't have time to run practices because other things are going on.\" Coleman agreed, saying that having the kids come to practice every day is one of the bigger challenges of summer coaching. \"Kids' lives are hectic over the summer with families going away and kids going to camp,\" she said. \"When it comes to practice, I think it's important to respect that there are a ton of things going on over the summer and you have to take that into account.\" With kids often unavailable for the duration of a summer season, Henning said there is a completely different atmosphere during the summer and that coaches need to have a different mind-set. \"The dynamic for the team really varies during the [summer] season,\" the Verona swim coach said. \"These kids are really here for recreational purposes and it's not as competitive.\" While there is less of a competitive aspect to summer coaching, the job may be a bit more difficult, according to Henning. \"It's stressful and definitely not a light job,\" he said. \"It's a lot of constant work and thinking and you have to deal with vacations, so the roster kind of changes week to week. It keeps me on my toes.\" Nelson, who serves as Cedar Grove's freshman baseball coach during the school year, said he does not find it more or less difficult and mentioned that things simply need to be done a little differently than they would during the school season. \"There are things that are tougher and things that aren't,\" he said. \"In the summer, you want to make sure everyone plays and gets a chance to get better. In the school year, the goal is to win games.\" Sports Editor | Verona-Cedar Grove Times Print Zach gewelb/Staff Photographer \"There are things that are tougher and things that aren't,\" he said. \"In the summer, you want to make sure everyone plays and gets a chance to get better. In the school year, the goal is to win games.\" Coleman, like Nelson, said that figuring out the right mixture of competing and making sure every participant is involved can be challenging and make things a bit more difficult over the summer. \"You do have to find that balance between fun and hard work and we try to do that,\" Coleman said. Another difficulty that every coach faces during the summer is the weather. Different sports have to endure different types of weather that can interrupt practices or events for days at a time. For football and baseball, the summer heat becomes a factor, while rain can affect any of the outdoor sports, particularly swimming. \"There are so many unpredictable summer storms, especially in July,\" Coleman said. \"It's one of the things you absolutely can not control and you just have to accept it sometimes.\" Henning agreed with Coleman, saying that he tries to plan a week of practices around the weather because the rain and thunderstorms will prevent the kids from getting in the water. He said he meets with his assistant coaches and they look at the weather online and determine what the practice schedule will look like based on the reports. Besides the daily pressures of coaching a team over the summer, coaches have to sacrifice time that could be spent with their friends and families. It is something that every coach has to endure, but the coaches know what the deal is before the season starts. \"Yes, for me, I have two kids and I'm a teacher so I'm used to spending time with them over the summer,\" Nelson said. \"I do value that time and it's hard to balance everything, but that's just what you deal with this time of year.\" Racioppe said that not always being with his family comes with the territory of coaching. \"When you make the commitment, you're going to be spending time away from your family,\" he said. \"That's part of coaching.\" While both Racioppe and Nelson acknowledged that spending time away from their families is simply part of the job, they both stated that it does not necessarily make it any easier to do so. Coleman and Henning both said that they believe all the time that goes into coaching is necessary, no matter the cost. They said the focus is all about helping the kids on their respective teams. \"I put the time in because I want to put the time in,\" Henning said. \"I put a lot of extra time in and every day I'm going over my plan for the rest of the week and everything is constantly changing. Putting in the time, you get a better product in the end and I fully live by that.\" Coleman, who will be entering her junior year at Villanova University, said she is thrilled to be able to make this kind of commitment. \"Right now in my life it's something I'm happy to devote my life to,\" she said. \"It does become a huge time commitment and it's always a give-and-take between doing what you need to do for your team and what you need to do for yourself.\" For Coleman, all she wants to do is make a difference for the kids on her team. She said that is one of the main reasons why she is coaching this summer. \"My favorite part [of coaching in the summer] is in the smallest moments,\" she said. \"It's the moment when you see everything click and see when they realize they did what they thought they couldn't do and accomplish something they thought they couldn't. It might only last a second, but it's something I love being a part of.\" Henning said his favorite part of the summer season is the bond that is created with the kids he coaches. \"It's really amazing to see how much the kids grow and bond with you and you can tell that they are really looking up to you,\" he said. \"To me that's the most enjoyable part of this job. Despite all of the time and hard work that goes into coaching, these coaches do not complain. They put in their time and do what is necessary to make in impact. If you ask them, it's all worth it.

Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin.

The goals are noble on the surface, but they have been used -- with scant results -- to tax us more, employ more government workers, and expand the power of Washington. All three \"wars\" have benefitted only one group of people: the D.C. political class. If we had every penny back that we spent on these fake “wars,” the country would be better off and there would be no federal deficit. If you now self-identify as \"poor\" and \"aggrieved,\" you get money to sit at home. Recent data from the Senate Budget Committee tells the real story of how out-of-control our supposed \"War on Poverty\" has become. According to the latest census, about 17 million American families' income falls below the poverty line. Counting all federal and state spending on welfare, food stamps, healthcare, housing, Obamaphones and other hand-outs intended to buy their votes, we spend $61,000 per year on each household under the poverty line. Of course they do not get all of that $61K. The greasy hands of our government take and waste a lot of it before it gets to the supposedly needy. There are currently 80 federal “poverty\" programs, none of which coordinate, nor care to, with the others. We spend more than $1 trillion per year on all of these duplicitous programs full of crony appointees and make-work jobs for bureaucrats and their families, many in union jobs from which they cannot be fired. Spending on such programs is up 32% since Obama took office. The recession ended shortly after Obama took office, around June of 2009. In a recovering economy, it is unprecedented how much government entitlement spending has grown. It’s no longer need, it’s greed. We know it as the dependency welfare state. Thanks to Obama, 47 million now receive EBT/food stamps. The USDA markets this program, often in Spanish, to encourage dependency. To Obama this isn't welfare, it's voter outreach. The Department of Health and Human Services was forced to admit that it sent checks for a total of $30 million to Medicaid recipients who were dead. These dead people are important to Democrats, as they will represent a large voting bloc in the 2016 presidential race. Why not at least give the $61,000 directly to the folks in poverty? Then they would spend the money in the real economy, thus stimulating it. Get government out of the way and let the free market work its miracles. Nancy Pelosi famously said she was going to “drain the swamp” in D.C. to clean up government. Of course, she never did it; she just inserted her own swamp rats.

Our \"poor\" are overweight, have smart phones and get angry when they are not taken care of by those of us who work and pay taxes. On the bright side, many are too fat to riot these days. Most Americans would not mind helping the poor, but for them to view us as the villains here makes this relationship unsustainable. Immigrants now come to America to pursue the new American dream: food stamps, Section 8 housing, government-funded healthcare and disability payments. And if you can sue someone and win a jury verdict, even better. The Boston Herald reported that the Tsarnaev brothers’ family received more than $100,000 in EBT cards, government housing support, college grants and welfare cash during their short stay in America. Like many of our home-grown moochers, they felt no shame in taking from America. Then the brothers bombed, maimed and killed innocent people at the Boston Marathon. If I were prosecuting the case, I would name three more accomplices to their crime: our immigration system, political correctness, and our welfare system.",

No, they were not the kind of fireworks we celebrate with on the Fourth today. They were the fireworks generated by the spirit of freedom, by the desires of free thinking people everywhere to breathe the air of self-determination. It is amazing how the words penned by Thomas Jefferson affected the lives of millions of people all over the globe. In the decade following the creation of the world’s first democracy here in North America, democracy had its birth on the European continent through the French Revolution. Let’s look more closely at the beginning of that great docu- ment. “We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the Consent of the Governed.” In fact, no government before the United States was ever established on the principle that men were created equal. Even some of the founding fathers were very concerned with the ability of “common” men to vote with intelligence and purpose. The only “right” known to the people and governments of Europe was the “divine right of kings.” That was the belief that God placed kings in their positions and, as such, they could do no wrong. They were God’s chosen ambassadors on Earth and were to be followed without question. The Declaration puts in written form what was in the hearts of men everywhere, that we all deserved equal rights and equal protection before the law. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were all judged to be traitors by King George in England. After the signing Benjamin Franklin was heard to say, “We had all better hang together or we shall most assuredly hang separate- ly.” There are probably several hundred thousand people in the United States today who can trace their family tree back to a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The Hopkins family had a signer. His name was Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island. He wasn’t as influential as John Adams or Thomas Jefferson. He wasn’t as eloquent as John Hancock or Benjamin Franklin. But he was there, and he put his life on the line just like the others. He carried the Declaration back to Rhode Island and sold its contents to his constituents. His name still lives today in the history of these United States, as do all the other signers of that Declaration that shaped this great nation of ours. Anderson resident Mark Hopkins, is a former president of three colleges, including what is now Anderson University. He writes columns for the Independent Mail and Gatehouse News Service. He can be reached at presnet@presnet.net.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Thirty. That's how many spaces Paul Frost looked at over the course of year while trying to set up his first solo venture, a globally inspired sandwich shop he dreamed up while working at places as diverse at Tangerine, Chifa, Kanella and the Talamore Country Club. Eventually, the Restaurant School grad settled on the cozy red-brick building on the corner of Front and Morris formerly occupied by BYOB Langostino. Done in white vinyl lettering, the catchy logo caught my attention, made me pull over and stare into the windows like a kid peering into a candy store. South Philly isn't short on great sandwich shops, but they don't happen to be concentrated in Pennsport, a neighborhood I'm constantly passing through. Frost opened 1st Ward in early June with a menu of riffs on between-bread classics like po' boys and grilled cheese —\"all things I used to make for staff meal,\" he says — plus salads, soup and sides. When I popped in for an early dinner after a biblical thunderstorm, it looked sunny despite the gray skies: soft ash floors, picture windows, white wainscoting, local art. But the fried cauliflower dish, tender florets tangy with lemon and sumac, was what really brightened my night. Served with a sidecar of chilled romesco, the perfectly cooked vegetable proved Frost's skill — and 1st Ward's ambition. This isn't your neighborhood hoagie shack. Pork belly braised half a day in hoisin forms the base for the banh mi, one of the two sandwiches I tried. The slices of pork were crispy and gooey in all the right places, their richness balanced by fresh cilantro and threads of house-pickled cucumber and carrot. Washington Avenue diehards might turn up their noses at the lack of pâté, or the predominant sweetness; my only complaint was the lack of fresh jalapeño, which would add a more complex heat than the smear of sriracha mayo. Served open-face on sesame bread, the mozzarella-eggplant sandwich was like a pair of giant bruschetta. Frost made the soft, supple mozz in-house; the wheels of fresh tomato were juicy and sweet, and the crowns of fresh greens streaked in balsamic lent it the vibe of a fresh Italian salad. The grilled marinated eggplant slices bordered on underdone; another minute on the grill, and they would have been perfect. I matched my sandwiches with a cone of slender, skin-on fries (crisp and well-seasoned) and a class-defying spring mix salad furnished with Gorgonzola, dried cherries, candied pumpkin seeds and Dijon vinaigrette. I would go out of my way to eat at 1st Ward again. Fortunately, I don't have to reroute — and soon, that might be the case for sandwich feigns who don't live in South Philly. Frosts hopes to open locations all around the city. This first one is a good start.",

    "LabBody": "NEW DELHI: July 10, 2015, DHNS. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, has expelled 73 students for under-performance as they failed to secure the minimal Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 5 in the first year of their BTech programme.As expulsion of such a large number of students in one go created a flutter, the hands of the Human Resource Development Ministry remained tied as the parents of these students had undertaken at the time of their admission that their wards' poor performance could lead to their removal from the institute. “The number of students expelled by IIT-Roorkee on Wednesday may be a bit higher, but this not a new thing. Students are shown doors at most of the IITs for under-performance. This is the rule. The ministry can not interfere in such issues,” said official sources.After their expulsion, many of the students have pleaded for “mercy”. IIT-Roorkee will decide on their prayers “as it deems fit”, said sources. The institute’s action, however, brought in the open a deeper problem IITs face in terms of getting quality students. Many IIT professors suggested that the change in the question pattern of entrance examinations brought almost a decade ago should be blamed for the situation.“Earlier, IIT aspirants had to answer descriptive questions in the entrance test. This actually helped IITs select meritorious students,” an IIT-Delhi professor told Deccan Herald.DH News Service.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

    "DiffbotBody": "Water from a public hydrant that Tom Selleck has been accused of stealing from in dry California was legally purchased, an official said. The Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County sued the \"Magnum, P.I.\" star, alleging that a tanker truck filled up at the hydrant and took it to Selleck's 60-acre ranch more than a dozen times in the past two years. The district announced a tentative settlement with Selleck on Thursday. Jay Spurgin, public works director for Thousand Oaks, said a construction company paid a fee to secure the rights to draw water from the city hydrant two years ago. About 1.4 million gallons of water were taken from the hydrant during that period. \"There was water used during that time, and it was paid for,\" he said. Construction firms and contractors can obtain special meters that allow them to haul water from hydrants for large projects. Companies can draw as much water as they need or sell it to a third party as long as they pay the monthly service charge and water bill, Spurgin said. The water meter in question was removed in June. It's unclear if Selleck or his employees bought the water from the company or another source. A representative for Selleck didn't immediately return a request for comment on Friday. The water district said it spent nearly $22,000 for a private detective to investigate. District officials declined to provide details of the tentative settlement, which has to be approved by the water board next week. California is grappling with a persistent drought, and the community where Selleck has his land is under mandatory cutbacks as high as 36 percent",

    "DiffbotBody": "Without getting too immersed in the MIT-level details, suffice to say Google's Deep Dream algorithm makes ordinary images look like all-out LSD trips. After Google announced their algorithm last month, the question immediately became: What would happen if you apply that algorithm and its breakthrough in neural networking to something already exceedingly trippy? The answer is this acid-fried clip from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the 1998 film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo adventure. In this scene, Thompson (played by Johnny Depp) flashes back to the Electric Kool-Acid Tests; however, the Google Deep Dream algorithm adds an extra layer of psychedelia over what's already a surreal scene. As Depp wades through the San Francisco scene, with Jefferson Airplane's \"Somebody to Love\" pounding in the background, borders morph and people's faces melt briefly into basset hounds and other household pets. In one instance, when an LSD-seeking man portrayed by Lyle Lovett yells out to solicit drugs, the interior of his mouth houses a third eyeball. It's the kind of terrifying acid trip only the brain of a computer can dream up (or Fear and Loathing artist Ralph Steadman). As the Google Research Blog explained when they announced Deep Dream, \"We train an artificial neural network by showing it millions of training examples and gradually adjusting the network parameters until it gives the classifications we want. The network typically consists of 10-30 stacked layers of artificial neurons. Each image is fed into the input layer, which then talks to the next layer, until eventually the 'output' layer is reached. The network’s 'answer' comes from this final output layer.\" The algorithm was then passed on to tech-savvy users to experiment with, resulting in the Fear \u0026 Loathing clip created by YouTube user Roelof Pieters as well as countless other hallucinogenic images dreamt up by computers. 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",
    "LabBody": "Without getting too immersed in the MIT-level details, suffice to say Google's Deep Dream algorithm makes ordinary images look like all-out LSD trips. After Google announced their algorithm last month, the question immediately became: What would happen if you apply that algorithm and its breakthrough in neural networking to something already exceedingly trippy? The answer is this acid-fried clip from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the 1998 film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo adventure. In this scene, Thompson (played by Johnny Depp) flashes back to the Electric Kool-Acid Tests; however, the Google Deep Dream algorithm adds an extra layer of psychedelia over what's already a surreal scene. As Depp wades through the San Francisco scene, with Jefferson Airplane's \"Somebody to Love\" pounding in the background, borders morph and people's faces melt briefly into basset hounds and other household pets. In one instance, when an LSD-seeking man portrayed by Lyle Lovett yells out to solicit drugs, the interior of his mouth houses a third eyeball. It's the kind of terrifying acid trip only the brain of a computer can dream up (or Fear and Loathing artist Ralph Steadman). As the Google Research Blog explained when they announced Deep Dream, \"We train an artificial neural network by showing it millions of training examples and gradually adjusting the network parameters until it gives the classifications we want. The network typically consists of 10-30 stacked layers of artificial neurons. Each image is fed into the input layer, which then talks to the next layer, until eventually the 'output' layer is reached. The network’s 'answer' comes from this final output layer.\" The algorithm was then passed on to tech-savvy users to experiment with, resulting in the Fear \u0026 Loathing clip created by YouTube user Roelof Pieters as well as countless other hallucinogenic images dreamt up by computers.",

It’s a consequential moment for the Eurozone. Now we see what happens when a country runs out of other people’s money. Comment Like our country, Greeks have long slid down the slippery slope of socialism. They are now gambling their country's future like Jimmy the Greek. It’s a consequential moment for the Eurozone. Now we see what happens when a country runs out of other people’s money. Leftist Prime Minister (Alexis) Tsipras convinced the entitlement-minded Greeks to vote \"no\" on repaying the debts that fund their lazy lifestyle. The country has run up unsustainable budget deficits with lavish government spending on unions, early retirements for government workers beholden only to the political class, impossible labor laws, regulations, taxing the most productive, subsidizing failing businesses, Madoff-like accounting practices and socialized health care. Sound familiar? It could be Barack Obama's own \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Hypocritically, President Obama called the Greek Prime Minister to discuss the deteriorating situation. The Greek leader responded, “Are we talking ours or yours?” In one of his many \"Do as I say, not as I do\" moments, Obama lectured that Greece should curtail spending and reduce its debt. Then the Greek leader advised Obama on the best way to make a tourist destination out of the ruins of a once great country. 16% of Greece's budget goes to fund government pensions. (This is the type of country whose navy has ten ships and 250 admirals.) Pandering populist politicians then raise taxes to pay off unsustainable financial promises. The productive leave the country, along with the businesses they own, and the situation spirals. Greece's economy has contracted by 1/3 since its last crisis in 2010, which led it to borrow from the IMF (International Monetary Fund). A payment of only $1.5 billion euros came due June 30th, but Greece could not come up with the money. Obama thought owing only $1.5 billion was cute; hell, he hides that much money as an earmark in an appropriations bill. The U.S. is 17% of the IMF, so we pay. IMF'ed again! What has happened to Greece is happening in the U.S. under Obama. Businesses are leaving. We have the about the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world; as a result, corporations are doing “inversions.” American companies merge with Swiss or Irish companies and move their headquarters there, often cutting their tax rate in half. ACE bought the venerable U.S. company Chubb last week and moved its headquarters to Zurich. Many other companies are doing the same thing, for the simple reason that corporate tax rates are 12.5% in Ireland and 35% in the U.S.A. Business goes where it is treated best. The low tax countries get the revenues -- and the jobs. Most Americans do not understand the long-term economics of this situation.

They think the Eurozone is the area of your coworker’s body that HR department films warn you not to touch. If Greece goes under and is kicked out of the Euro, it will be fine. You have to have heaven and hell for religion to work. In capitalism, you have to have success or bankruptcy for it to work. The latter is cleansing, and there has to be pain. Greece is now only 1% of the GDP of the Euro, so its financial meltdown not that important to the world economy. Banks have closed, and Greece is reverting to a third-world mess. The real geopolitical risk is that Putin, the loan shark of the region, will pounce on Greece’s socialist-minded population. Puerto Rico and Greece are now going broke. California is on its way. What it is about coastal weather that makes people want to sip coffee in cafes all day while complaining that government doesn’t do enough for them? The Greeks created philosophy. So who would guess that a country full of philosophy majors couldn't repay its debt to a U.S. government filled with gender studies majors? A country with all those Greek letters in its name looks like a fraternity house, and thus will get nothing from this administration -- except maybe a false rape story in Rolling Stone. You will see Greece coming to Obama for a bailout disguised as \"humanitarian help.\" Obama will say, \"Up yours, Zorba!

    "DiffbotBody": "spoilers reveal the Week 3 Battle of the Block went as planned. The house held the competition on Friday night (July 10), giving the eviction nominees a chance to get off the block. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Austin Matelson nominated Jason Roy and Meg Maley for eviction, while Vanessa Rousso went with James Huling and John McGuire as her nominees. The plan was for John to throw the competition, leaving Vanessa as the HOH, with James and John as the remaining nominees. A report from Big Brother Network confirms it went exactly like they planned and Vanessa is in charge of the house. The live feeds show that Austin and Vanessa are ecstatic that everything went according to their plan. The kicker was that James performed so terribly in the BOTB, that the HOHs were almost convinced that he was throwing it on purpose. This made it very easy for John to throw the competition, much like how he threw the one last week when Da’Vonne Rogers was his parter. He needs to be careful, though, or he is going to get a bad reputation in the BB17 house. Additional Big Brother 17 spoilers from Friday night include Austin and Vanessa continuing to plan on how the rest of the week is going to work. While Vanessa has all the power as the sole Head of Household, she seems very open to continuing her work with Austin. This is much different than when Shelli Poole did her best to take control away from Becky Burgess during Week 2 of the show. That might come back to hurt Shelli a bit later in the game. Moving forward, James Huling is still the target for eviction, and he may not completely realize what’s going on. Outside of his good game play during the first week of this season, he hasn’t been doing much in the house. Winning the first HOH competition may have been a bad thing for his personal game, because during the second week he almost appeared lazy in the house. It hasn’t changed and he may need to win the Week 3 Veto to keep from becoming the third houseguest voted out of this season. The revelation of him being a target should be shown by CBS on Sunday’s episode (July 12). There are likely to be more Big Brother 17 spoilers coming out on Saturday (July 11), when the house heads in for the Week 3 Veto competition. If John ends up winning the Veto and taking himself down, Vanessa already has a plan to nominate Jeff Weldon in his place. [Image Source: CBS Big Brother Press Kit] is the latest entry in the last-gen game being remastered for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One party. Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

Subscribe Now Get the digital edition David Byrne, BB King, The Jam and Sly \u0026 The Family Stone all feature in the new issue of Uncut, dated August 2015: in UK shops now and also available digitally. The former Talking Heads mastermind is on the cover, and inside Byrne takes us through his long career, his work with Brian Eno and St Vincent, the Meltdown festival he’s curating in London this summer, and how he accidentally invented hip-hop. “There was this temptation to really get into the pop machine and take it to the next level of pop arenas,” Byrne says, recalling the late ’80s when Talking Heads began scoring significant hits, “and you start building up this huge infrastructure which you then have to write and record to support. “I sensed losing some freedom there, as regards what I can do; and I like too much being able to do all of those different sorts of things.” In honour of David Byrne, Uncut also count down the 50 greatest New York albums, featuring The Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Frank Sinatra, The Strokes and more. Uncut salutes BB King and examines whether the blues that the guitarist helped to invent is facing extinction itself. “Right now, the blues isn’t cool to the young,” Paul Puccioni tells us. On the eve of a major exhibition about The Jam, Paul Weller talks us through the rare exhibits on show, much of it collected by Weller’s own family. “I didn’t keep anything,” he admits cheerfully. “I used to destroy my notebooks after every record, burn them or rip them up. I was always scorched earth, almost ceremonial. It’s been and done.” Elsewhere, we investigate the early days of psych-funk genius Sly Stone, and the Family Stone, as a boxset of their epochal Fillmore East shows from 1968 emerges. “Sly Stone reinvented pop music in his own image,” says the Family Stone’s Cynthia Robinson. Merle Haggard answers your questions, and queries from famous fans, in our Audience With… feature this month. “I’m thankful for the life I’ve been given,” the Bakersfield Bard tells us. In an in-depth interview, Ezra Furman talks Lou Reed, protest music, self-harm and gender fluidity… “I’m gonna have unresolved issues until I’m dead,” he explains. Peter Perrett and the rest of The Only Ones recall the creation of their cosmic classic “Another Girl, Another Planet”, a story taking in charisma, double-drum feats and various addictions. “At the time, I was more addicted to sex…” says Perrett today. The Monkees take us through their career, album by album, from their self-titled debut, through mind-bending, psychedelic soundtrack Head, right up to 1996’s Justus. “We were essentially a garage band,” says Micky Dolenz. “Even on the television show, remember, we never made it… it was that struggle for success that was so important, and I think that’s what made it so endearing to so many kids around the world.” Elsewhere, The Supremes’ Mary Wilson details her life in records, we look at a new exhibition on The Kinks, examine the return of David Pearce and Flying Saucer Attack, and speak to Gordon Lightfoot about his “beneficial” emotional stress.

    "DiffbotBody": "Greece hasn’t exactly had an easy go of things lately. The country, which has been riddled with debt throughout the last decade, according to Vox, has needed bailouts and assistance from countries like Germany just to stay afloat and avoid total financial collapse. Most recently, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made a request for more bailout funds. Depending upon what happens with that request, Greece could either receive some reprieve from its lenders or see its banking system collapse, which would mean it no longer would be able to use the euro for its currency, according to The Associated Press. Though the crisis in Greece is a world away, this may be something that Americans can empathize with, given that Greece’s financial troubles are eerily similar to modern American poverty issues and one of America’s darkest periods, the Great Depression — which shows that Greece and the United States may not be all that different after all. But when you compare Greece's current crisis to the Great Depression, Greece may actually be worse off than the U.S. was during that time, according to The New York Times. “Greece is in its own Great Depression. But unlike the United States, it won't be able to get back on its feet as quickly,” Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told The New York Times. The country “is shackled by onerous rules and regulations, an aging population and a dysfunctional domestic political system … sharing important elements of sovereignty with its own creditors.” Greece can’t afford to pay its bills, which was something that America, conversely, could afford to do because of World War II and military spending, according to The Times. Similarly, America encouraged its people to seek employment and poured “billions of dollars into public jobs,” The Times reported. Meanwhile, Greece still has a 28 percent unemployment rate as of last year, with no signs of slowing down. Greece’s stock market is also worse than America’s was back then, The Times reported. The market spiraled down to -89 percent during the the Great Depression’s later years in 1932, while Greece’s hit a low of -91 percent in June 2012. But while Greece’s financial situation looks more troublesome than America’s did during the Great Depression, today's Americans appear worse off than the Greeks because of the United States' high amounts of debt and inability to get rid of that debt, according to Fortune. “Whatever happens,” Fortune reported, “the average American may be worse off than Greece.” In fact, Americans may have more debt based on income earned than the European country, Fortune reported. Greeks owe 1.77 euros for every euro they earn. Meanwhile, Americans owe $204,992 for every $55,192 they earn, Fortune reported. So while Greeks have a debt-to-income ratio of 177 percent, Americans’ sit at a whopping 370 percent, Fortune reported. And Greece’s debt can be forgiven, unlike the debt of an average American. Fortune reported that if Greece gets rescued from lenders and exits the eurozone, then Greeks won’t have any more debt. Meanwhile, Americans, even when they declare bankruptcy, still hold onto some debts, like student loans and housing debt. Greece can also print its own money, assuming it has to leave the eurozone, according to Fortune. Though this could cause inflation in the country, it will allow them to avoid a financial crisis and survive in the meantime, Fortune reported. But indebted Americans can’t print their own currency, which means U.S. citizens always have to pay back their debt. All of this points to the fact that the United States and Greece today have a lot in common, according to USA Today's editorial board. More than just their debt similarities, both countries have aging populations and “irresponsible banks lending to irresponsible borrowers,” USA Today said. Greece, though, is just a few years ahead of the United States. If America doesn’t realize these similarities, the United States could soon face a tragedy much like Greece’s in the future, USA Today said. “America is heading for its own debt crisis,” USA Today said. “It won't be complicated by whether it should drop out of a currency union. And it might be delayed by a vibrant and innovative private sector. But it could arrive in as little as a decade. And then everything will seem Greek to us.” Herb Scribner is a writer for Deseret News National. Send him an email at hscribner@deseretdigital.com or follow him on Twitter @herbscribner.",

    "DiffbotBody": "It has been decades since the Lake Shawnee Amusement Park buzzed with the laughter of children. But according to local legend, the park is still a playground for ghosts. The southern West Virginia park was abandoned in 1966, after the accidental deaths of two of its young patrons. But it seems Lake Shawnee’s haunted history reaches much farther back. Mercer County was home to a Native American tribe until 1783, when a European family’s attempt to settle the land sparked a violent turf war. The patriarch of the family was a farmer named Mitchell Clay, according to the Wyoming County Report. While he was out hunting, a band of Native Americans reportedly killed his youngest son, Bartley Clay. A daughter, Tabitha, was knifed to death in the struggle. Eldest son Ezekial was kidnapped and burned at the stake. Mitchell Clay enlisted the help of other white settlers to seek vengeance for his family. After burying his children, he murdered several of the Native Americans. Centuries later, in the 1920s, a businessman named Conley T. Snidow purchased the site of the Clay farm and developed it into an amusement park. He built a swing set, a ferris wheel, and opened up the pond for swimming. But death still hung over that cursed parcel of land. A little girl in a pink ruffled dress met her end after climbing into the circling swing set. She was killed after a truck backed into the path of the swing. Another little one, this time a boy, drowned in the amusement park’s swimming pond. According to Visit West Virginia, the park’s rides were responsible for a total of six deaths. The park eventually shut down, but its structures were left to rot and rust. The park’s new owner, Gaylord White, says he can hear the wooden swings creak, though it may not be the wind that pushes them. “Sometimes the seat will start to move underneath your hand until you feel cold air blowing through the seat,” Gaylord White II told the Travel Channel. “And when you get to the middle you feel something warm. And we believe that’s her spirit.” The younger White said he’s even seen the little girl, with her dress covered in blood. “She looked at me and as long as she looked at me, I couldn’t move,” he said. Paranormal investigators now frequent the site. It has also been featured on the Discovery Channel’s “GhostLab” and the Travel Channel’s “The Most Terrifying Places in America.” Lake Shawnee has now opened up for daring visitors who want to see the place for themselves.

Satellite shows possible ghost ship that may be missing yacht Boat club to ferry people along Brooklyn's own River Styx on Halloween ROME — Italian police said on Wednesday they had seized assets worth $2.2 billion and issued 41 arrest warrants in raids on gambling companies in Italy and abroad run by the 'Ndrangheta mafia organization. Police believe the firms, including six that were operating out of Malta, were used to launder vast sums of illicit cash. Italy's mafia groups, including the 'Ndrangheta from the southern region of Calabria, the Camorra from Naples and Sicily's Cosa Nostra, have strengthened their grip on southern Italy's economy and spread to the richer north during a three-year economic slump. Among the targets of Wednesday's operation were 1,500 betting shops, 82 gambling websites, 45 Italian companies and 11 foreign firms, as well as \"innumerable\" property assets, the financial police said in a statement. Apart from the firms run from Malta, two were in Spain, two in Romania and one in Austria. The Calabrian mafia has grown rich on the drugs trade, becoming one of Europe's biggest importers of South American cocaine, with strong ties to Mexican and Colombian cartels. It also runs companies in sectors including trucking and hospitality, with a stranglehold on the economy of Calabria, where unemployment is above 20%.",

It is like an annual Woodstock, where modern-day hippies and music lovers go to camp for four days and watch top bands play. Comment Every few years, I attend Bonnaroo, for some unknown allure. Bonnaroo is a fantastic series of concerts on a 700-acre farm between Nashville and Chattanooga. It is like an annual Woodstock, where modern-day hippies and music lovers go to camp for four days and watch top bands play. I do not camp, however. As I came to discover, camping outdoors involves the outdoors, and I do not like discomfort in any form. The outdoors is best left outdoors. I was initially told Bonnaroo is a made-up word that means nothing, like “lollapalooza” or “Congressional ethics.” Later, I found out that the word is Cajun slang for “fun.” Bonnaroo is attended mostly by folks with nose rings and tattoos, wearing bathing suits they really should have reconsidered. Although I am steadfastly against more government, I really think some of these women should apply for a permit to wear a two-piece. Bill Clinton could chair the committee to review applicants; he’d like that. As you might imagine, the Birkenstock crowd there had all their liberal causes. Kids seemed more interested in talking about the world’s problems than coming up with any solutions. As best I can figure, they like to “raise awareness” in hopes that someone else will actually do something — perhaps their parents who paid for their $250 tickets. Apparently it is more noble to be an activist in non-quantifiable, grand-scale things such as world pollution, global warming and the environment. Clearly, that is easier than actually cleaning up themselves and their campsites. Besides, chicks dig someone who pretends to care. Any time music fans are together, there will be drugs. Yet so bold was the drug use that a kid could be arrested with pot found in his system and he would probably ask for it back. At Bonnaroo, the entrepreneurial spirit abounds, a shining example of the same capitalism that the kids seem to detest on a larger scale. Liberals are OK with making money as long as they act like they feel bad about it. Vendors on foot offered a wide array of pot, coke and acid for a reasonable, market-driven price. Ironically, drugs were sold at a more competitive price than in the prescription drug benefit Congress “gave” us, because at least at Bonnaroo the drug dealers are forced to compete. The dealers operate by walking past someone and naming their product. So I hear the word “pot” said by a passerby. If one wanted to buy said product, then (unlike with our government’s drug purchases) one would engage the vendor in price negotiations. And by “one” I mean Scott. And like almost all of my purchases, it would begin with, “You ain’t no cop, are you?” Being one of the oldest dudes there, I really did not get many offers to “Rock the Vote” or buy drugs. I’m getting to the age that I’m starting to pay attention to those catheter commercials on TV. In fact, I am not sure that when I walked by one dealer, he did not say “Viagra.” » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

Kids seemed more interested in talking about the world’s problems than coming up with any solutions. As best I can figure, they like to “raise awareness” in hopes that someone else will actually do something — perhaps their parents who paid for their $250 tickets. Apparently it is more noble to be an activist in non-quantifiable, grand-scale things such as world pollution, global warming and the environment. Clearly, that is easier than actually cleaning up themselves and their campsites. Besides, chicks dig someone who pretends to care. Any time music fans are together, there will be drugs. Yet so bold was the drug use that a kid could be arrested with pot found in his system and he would probably ask for it back. At Bonnaroo, the entrepreneurial spirit abounds, a shining example of the same capitalism that the kids seem to detest on a larger scale. Liberals are OK with making money as long as they act like they feel bad about it. Vendors on foot offered a wide array of pot, coke and acid for a reasonable, market-driven price. Ironically, drugs were sold at a more competitive price than in the prescription drug benefit Congress “gave” us, because at least at Bonnaroo the drug dealers are forced to compete. The dealers operate by walking past someone and naming their product. So I hear the word “pot” said by a passerby. If one wanted to buy said product, then (unlike with our government’s drug purchases) one would engage the vendor in price negotiations. And by “one” I mean Scott. And like almost all of my purchases, it would begin with, “You ain’t no cop, are you?” Being one of the oldest dudes there, I really did not get many offers to “Rock the Vote” or buy drugs. I’m getting to the age that I’m starting to pay attention to those catheter commercials on TV. In fact, I am not sure that when I walked by one dealer, he did not say “Viagra.” They register voters there because they know that the kids are going to vote Democrat, since they get most of their political views from the drummer for Third Eye Blind. The same drummer who rails against oil companies’ 10-cents-per-gallon profit has no problem selling his band’s T-shirts at his concert for $45 apiece. Another barker said he supported Hillary Clinton because she would fight global warming. I told him he might be onto something — there is nothing about Hillary that is warm, so she really cannot be the least bit to blame for that. Every year, I get the funnel cake, because at some point, my hunger is stronger than my memory. All in all, I really enjoyed Bonnaroo. I would advise all of the 40-somethings out there to try it. On one hand, it makes you feel old. Yet, with the vibrancy and infectious, carefree atmosphere, it makes you feel young and rejuvenated. And it reminds us that, although getting old is inevitable, acting old is optional.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Sports JC Cards July 10th, 2015 11:13 pm by Collin Brooks, Press Correspondent A late rally by the Johnson City Cardinals wasn’t enough to overcome an explosive seven run inning by Greeneville, as the hot bats gave the Astros a 10-4 win at Cardinal Park on Friday night. The Cardinals pulled within three runs in the seventh inning, but another big inning by the Astros gave them the early season series. “We get down seven early and nobody quit, we put up some runs and made it a ball game and gave ourselves a chance in the last couple of innings, but some unfortunate bounces in the final inning put the game out of reach,” Cardinals manager Chris Swauger said. “All-in-all we didn’t play bad, they just played well. So give credit to them.” First year Astros’ manager Lamarr Rogers was happy that his team was able to grab the early season series. “I’ve heard there is some history here, so get the win, especially after going down the first game of the series to get the next two,” he said. “It’s nice to see the kids come out and swing the bats like they have the last two nights.” Those bats took center stage for Greeneville in the third inning when Osvaldo Duarte started it all with a singe to right field, which scored Marion Avea. Two more runs scored when Aaron Mizell connected on his fifth double of the season. Mizell found his way home next, by the bat of Connor Goedert, which forced the Cardinals to pull starter Ramon Santos. However, the arm of Juan Bautista didn’t prove much better, as he gave up a home run to Hector Roa to make the score 7-0. The Cardinals slowly began chipping away at the Astros’ lead, starting with a home run for themselves off the bat of Chris Chinea. Johnson City scored again in the fifth as Allen Staton started the inning with a double to left field. He was brought home a batter later, when Ricardo Bautista knocked a line drive to center field to make the score 7-2. But the Cardinals weren’t done as they tried to rally in the seventh, by taking advantage of a pitching change, in which they plated two runs. It started with the bat of Bautista, who hit a double to left field. He found his way home two batters later on a wild pitch. The next run came from Edmundo Sosa, who reached base with a single, before being brought home by the bat of Magneuris Sierra. But the Astros bounced right back in the driving in three runs in the top of the ninth inning. On a night when the Cardinals honored the servicemen of the United States, it was a servicemen that finished off the night for the team on the mound, as Air Force graduate Ben Yokely took the mound in the eighth inning. Yokley will leave the Cardinals on July 28 to return to his position in Colorado Springs, Colo. He also threw out the ceremonial first pitch. “It was his day to pitch, it was that it just happened to be that it was on military appreciation night,” Swauger said. “But that was an awesome thing and I am glad he got to pitch tonight.” The Cardinals won’t have much time to think about dropping the series as they will travel to Elizabethton today to play the Twins. First pitch is set for 6 p.m. Swauger is well aware of the rivalry that festers just miles away. “Regardless of their record or our record, when your ten miles away from a team, you are going to play hard,” he said.

And the message delivered to reporters was not altogether factual, said Davis, noting that a press release announcing the grand jury’s decision stated that Smyrna and Cobb police “attempted to arrest Mr. Thomas on a felony probation violation warrant.” Thomas was actually being sought for a probation violation stemming from a conviction on a misdemeanor charge of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana. Davis said he is eager to find out what evidence was presented to the grand jury. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has submitted an open-records request and was informed it would receive the entire case file sometime next week. Of particular interest will be any information explaining why Owens felt compelled to shoot. Of the five officers dispatched to the Cumberland Parkway Goodyear, where Thomas worked, Owens was the only one to draw his gun. Thomas tried to elude the officers, jumping into a customer’s Maserati, a detail neither side disputes. With the only exit blocked by police, Thomas drove around the building twice. Owens told investigators he shot at the Maserati because he feared Thomas was going to run over an officer who was behind him. It’s a different narrative than the one provided immediately after the shooting, when Smyrna police told reporters Owens shot at Thomas to save himself. Davis said it’s no coincidence Owens’ story changed after it was revealed the fatal bullet entered through Thomas’ back. Co-counsel Rob Bozeman said he wants to know whether that other officer feared for his safety and, if so, why he didn’t feel the need to draw his gun. “It seems obvious that officer could’ve defended his own life,” Bozeman said.

Heineman, who often composed a camera crew of one, insinuates himself into a methamphetamine cook run by masked bandits who bear little resemblance to Bryan Cranston; trolls alongside a self-appointed border patrol agent on the U.S. side whose jingoistic beliefs shade into predictable racism; and, most profitably, shadows the charismatic leader of an anti-cartel militia in Michoacán, Mexico. José Manuel Mireles Valverde, a small-town physician whom his followers call \"El doctor,\" takes a bold stand against both drug traffickers and the corrupt national government, but the movie quickly reveals his increasing power fomenting its own moral struggles. Mireles' Autodefensas aren't picky about whom they label a cartel associate, leading to some terrifying scenes where you feel seconds away from watching an innocent person gunned down in the street, and as the militias become more powerful, they, too, become objects of the cartels' graft. Heineman's attempt to run the vigilantes' stories on both sides of the border in parallel — despite the fact that one is fighting a largely imaginary threat, the other a very real one — leads to tricky questions never quite reckons with. But it's undeniably thrilling, even as the ends to which that aesthetic is put to use remain disquieting.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. And with that, here is how I view the first round. 1. Tampa Bay Bucs - QB Jameis Winston, FSU - I still think Marcus Mariota has a chance to be selected here, much more than given credit for. As Yahoo's Charles Robinson reported, the Glazers have final say in signing off on Winston. But mocks are for what I think will happen, and most signs still point to Jameis. Winston can be a quality starter in the NFL. 2. Tennessee Titans - WR Amari Cooper, Alabama - A shocker, I know. No QB, no trade - I think the connection between Jacksonville and Cooper is permeating to push the move into fruition. My twitter friend Thomas Gower thinks Cooper would be the receiver pick over Kevin White. From a receiver style this does not make a ton of sense, but from a “safe” and projectable traits stance it does. 3. Jacksonville Jaguars - DL Leonard Williams, USC - Everyone is mocking an edge rusher here. I bet the Jaguars think they can get their edge rusher, for the role he will play, in the second round (Eli Harold, for example). Yes, the team signed Jared Odrick to play either the big end or 3 technique. I think the team is concerned with Sen’Derrick Marks’ availability early in the season. Marks’ contract is also very easy to move on from, if necessary. Adding another versatile piece up front that could be viewed as “safe” makes sense. 4. Cleveland Browns (via Oakland Raiders) - QB Marcus Mariota, Oregon - This one is going to get a bit complicated, but stay with me. The first part of the deal is obvious. Here is the hypothetical trade, via Alan Dandar: Yes, I know the Jimmy Johnson chart is outdated. But for this purpose, let's use it. Some teams still refer to it as a comparable. For the Browns: After the GM and owner made the wrong quarterback choice last year, there is pressure to make the decision right. Mariota will do just that. 5. Washington Redskins - OL Brandon Scherff, Iowa - Mimicking the recent approach of a division rival. I bet many teams will think Scherff is this year’s Zack Martin. Some might think this is early for a guard. Maybe, but acquiring prospects with traits that translate is paramount. 6. New York Jets - T Andrus Peat, Stanford - Links have sprouted in recent days placing Peat to the Jets as a long term replacement for D’Brickashaw Ferguson. It makes sense. The question is where Peat plays in 2015 before moving to left tackle in 2016. The Jets have had guard issues. 7. Oakland Raiders (via Chicago Bears) - EDGE Alvin Dupree, Kentucky - After trading down, the Raiders trade back up to land their target. Again, via Alan Dandar, here is the second hypothetical trade: This leaves the Raiders with picks 7, 19 and 71 in the first three rounds, basically converting a second round pick into pick No. 19 by just moving down a few slots. Dupree’s play on the field does not warrant a selection this early, but due to the “upside” I would be surprised if Bud isn’t a top three edge rusher selected. 8. Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Dante Fowler, Florida - There are plenty of connections here. Namely, the position need and Dan Quinn’s history with Fowler. Fowler is very active with his hand and length use to create separation. I bet he is the standard top edge rusher on most teams’ boards. 9. New York Giants - WR Kevin White, WVU - Another WR for the Giants? It seems the team focuses on OL, WR and pass rushers early on. The prospects left at two of those positions do not fit the Giants’ types.Rueben Randle is average and has one year left. Victor Cruz is coming off injury. The team did give a large contract to Dwayne Harris, but he would be best inside. White and OBJ would be quite a tandem. 10. St. Louis Rams - OL La’El Collins, LSU - I have no idea how to approach La’El’s projection. So, I will just keep it where it is. If the Rams select Collins, who plays LT? Either way, you have two powerful blockers along the offensive line in an offense that will need to keep its quarterback clean in the pocket and open running lanes. 11. Minnesota Vikings - CB Trae Waynes, Michigan State - Everything points to the Vikings selecting a cornerback. So will it happen? I could see one of three names: Waynes, Byron Jones and Kevin Johnson. Waynes is a press corner (or man in his zone) who uses length and frame to stick with receivers and combat the catch point. 12. Chicago Bears (via Raiders and Browns) - DT Danny Shelton, Washington - The Bears drop down only a few spots and exchange a third for a second and a six for a five. Look at pick No. 7 for more details. The team does not have a natural fit at nose tackle, and Shelton has consistently said the Bears have Browns have displayed the most interest in him. 13. New Orleans Saints - EDGE Vic Beasley, Clemson - My buddy Tony Pauline recently stated the Saints are very interested in Beasley. Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16. Houston Texans - CB Byron Jones, UConn - When I look at the Texans I see a glaring need at corner with Johnathan Joseph likely entering his last year with the team. But why is it not frequently mocked in the first round. The NFL like Jones more than I do. continue story » Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. 17. San Diego Chargers - RB Melvin Gordon III, Wisconsin - Two running backs in the top 20? Let’s destroy the narrative, NFL. Again, I’ll bring back the “foundation piece” logic. A team could look at other non-RB talents in this class and view them as role players. Then they could look at a ball carrier 18. Kansas City Chiefs - LB Eric Kendricks, UCLA - The Chiefs have to improve their inside linebackers. With so much talent up front, Kendricks would thrive in Kansas City. Add in the fact Derrick Johnson is in a contract year coming off injury, and it makes a lot of sense. 19. Oakland Raiders (via Cleveland Browns) - WR Breshad Perriman, UCF - Receiver is still a need for the Raiders. If they want Derek Carr to stretch the field more this year, they need a receiver with those intermediate and downfield skills. Perriman has them. 20. Philadelphia Eagles - OL Donovan Smith, Penn State - Surprise? Smith checks all the boxes the Eagles (apparently) look for: Senior Bowler, athletic and visited the team’s facility. I don’t love Smith’s game, but teams who do likely think he can play guard and tackle. They must be able to unpack the traits he offers. 21. Cincinnati Bengals - T D.J. Humphries, Florida - I don’t love this fit. However, both of the Bengals’ tackles are entering contract years. Humphries, Cedric Ogbuehi, Ereck Flowers, etc. are all options. Humphries has added weight during the draft process and now sits above 300 pounds. 22. Pittsburgh Steelers - CB Kevin Johnson, Wake Forest - Kevin Johnson could be selected much earlier. The Wake Forest corner has awareness and finds the football in both man and zone situations. There is little wasted movement to his game and he attacks the catch point. 23. Detroit Lions - DT Grady Jarrett, Clemson - Grady is not just a 1 technique. Yes, he can play it in the NFL and di at Clemson, but expect him to play a lot of 3 technique in the NFL. He will be an upfield disruptor from either spot while also holding his own against the run. He should be a first round pick, and the Lions have a need now and in the future. 24. Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Shane Ray, Missouri - This is a tough call, as Ray could easily land in the second round. He tested as a bad athlete (in the 22nd percentile for his position) but does maximize it on the field and possesses a great motor. Does that tape compensate for poor athleticism, a toe injury which might need surgery and a recent marijuana citation? I think Preston Smith and Owamagbe Odighizuwa are more talented prospects, but this isn’t an exercise in what I would do. 25. Carolina Panthers - LB Shaq Thompson, Washington - I know, where is the tackle? Cedric Ogbuehi makes a lot of sense. So does an edge rusher like Owa or Preston Smith. But Shaq’s comparison has been Thomas Davis all along, and the team needs TD’s long term replacement. Shaq can fill a coverage role early on in high percentage passing situations. 26. Baltimore Ravens - DL Arik Armstead, Oregon - Personally, I think Ozzie gets another great talent here. CB Marcus Peters is an obvious possibility. Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith.",

Cleveland Browns (via Oakland Raiders) - QB Marcus Mariota, Oregon - This one is going to get a bit complicated, but stay with me. The first part of the deal is obvious. Here is the hypothetical trade, via Alan Dandar: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183.

Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith. continue story »",

Music not only creates a soundtrack for the summer, but it can also be part of your summer reading list. Find these books and more at your local branch or omahalibrary.org. Kelsey Schwenker, library aide at the Millard Library, suggests a book that features a music student whose summer job turns out to be dangerously deceptive. “City of Dark Magic” by Magnus Flyte. This novel involves the mysterious city of Prague, a music student helping to catalog Beethoven’s manuscripts and the suicide (or possible murder) of her mentor. With intrigue, romance and music. What more could you want? Aura Sewell, library specialist at the Abrahams Library, listens to music in a new way thanks to her pick. “Bug Music: How Insects Gave Us Rhythm and Noise” by David Rothenberg. You don’t need to be a bug or music expert to enjoy “Bug Music.” The author’s passion for the topic is contagious. I never realized how many sounds I have been ignoring. Mark Sorensen, library specialist at W. Dale Clark Library, recommends books that explore connections made through music. “The Hum and the Shiver” by Alex Bledsoe. Pvt. Bronwyn Hyatt returns home from Iraq to the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee wounded in body and mind. She’s lost her connection to the songs of her kinfolk and gained a spectral “haint” that warns of tragedy to come. This is a totally unique contemporary fantasy — a love song to Appalachian music and folklore, richly layered, sexy, with a touch of the supernatural dancing just under the mandolin strings. “Bel Canto” by Ann Patchett. A world-class operatic diva, a Japanese millionaire, a youthful translator and a rebel soldier are thrown together in a South American villa when a coup attempt becomes a protracted hostage crisis. Dreamlike, hilarious and heartbreaking, this novel explores the power of music to unite us across languages and battle lines. Patchett modeled the heroine on soprano Renee Fleming. Read along with an album of her singing to complete the experience. Copyright ©2015 Omaha World-Herald. All rights reserved.

Freakazoid This cartoon came in 1995 and was about a 16-year-old boy who was sucked into his computer and absorbed all the information on the internet, turning him into Freakazoid! Given that the internet was pretty new back then, this storyline was actually plausible, but it was cancelled in 1997. 3. Ghostwriter A team of radically diverse kids solved mysteries with the help of a friendly ghost who communicates by manipulating words in its surroundings. Mind blowing that this ever got cancelled, but it did, after three years. 4. The Pirates of Dark Water An alien world being overridden by some creepy, dirty water? Too scary for most kids. That might be why it was cancelled in 1993. 5. Gargoyles Gargoyles had a fantastic mix of dark themes, terrific animation and underlying themes of sexual diversity, immigration and acceptance. We have no idea why this ever got cancelled, but it did, in 1997. 6. Midnight Patrol Four friends, Keiko, Carter, Nick and Rosie, went to sleep and were charged with missions by the Snooze Patrol.

    "DiffbotBody": "Celebrated theatre director Sir Peter Hall felt the need to apologise to Downton Abbey star Laura Carmichael after he disrupted her West End debut in 2012 by loudly ‘heckling’ from the stalls. His family have now disclosed that he was, in fact, suffering from dementia at the time. The health of Sir Peter, who is the father of Hollywood star Rebecca Hall and founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, has since deteriorated to such an extent that he moved into care this year. ‘Sir Peter is suffering from dementia, which was diagnosed in 2011,’ a family spokesman has permitted me to report. ‘Sir Peter is resident as a “paying guest” in the infirmary at the Charterhouse. 'No further statement will be made. The family would be grateful if his privacy were to be respected.’ The Charterhouse is a medieval former monastery in the City of London which serves as a home to 40 male pensioners, known as Brothers. It also has an infirmary, where Hall lives. ‘Peter is receiving excellent care,’ says a friend. ‘Brothers occupy spartan cells, eat together, and are expected to contribute culturally as well as doing washing up and other domestic chores. 'It’s a bit like a boarding school and Sir Peter’s theatre skills will be highly valued.’ Sir Peter, 84, who has been described as ‘the most powerful and influential figure in British theatre since World War II’, has six children. He had lived in Chelsea with fourth wife Nicki Frei, 54, a former National Theatre publicist. The criticism of his behaviour at the Vaudeville Theatre in 2012 now seems very unfair. Carmichael, who plays Lady Edith in Downton, was giving her closing speech in Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya when Sir Peter’s voice boomed: ‘Stop, stop, stop! It doesn’t work and you don’t work. It is not good enough.’ He was also heard complaining: ‘I could be at home watching television.’ He later sent a note of apology to the 28-year-old actress and said: ‘I am mortified that I unintentionally disrupted the final scene. I enjoyed the evening, and her performance, immensely and my remarks were in no way directed at her or the production.’ Ban on the run... Has Sir Paul McCartney joined the ranks of Tory voters? The ex-Beatle, 73, whose politics once had a Leftish-Green hue, let slip his preferences when he spoke out against the decision to grant a Commons vote which could weaken the fox-hunting ban. ‘The people of Britain are behind this Tory government on many things,’ Sir Paul said approvingly. ‘But [hunting] is cruel and unnecessary and will lose them support from ordinary people and animal lovers like myself.’ A far cry from the Macca who sent a telegram to Margaret Thatcher in 1982 warning her: ‘What the miners did to Ted Heath, the nurses will do to you.’ You can quote me on that ‘Of course she did, she had two kids and it wasn’t Downton Abbey.’ Tom Parker Bowles, when asked if his mother, the Duchess of Cornwall, cooked when he was a child ‘George Clooney is very handsome — I get it, but he’s not for me — he just reminds me of coffee.’ Gok Wan says those annoying Nespresso ads have killed Clooney’s charm. ‘I’m very unfit at the moment in terms of being “wobbly”. We went to Center Parcs recently — and my goodness, I was not in a great place, bikini-wise.’ TV presenter Kate Garraway ‘Let’s pay them for the Marbles, as they’ve now clearly lost them.’ John Cleese on the Greek economic crisis ‘Ballet hurts! It’s anti-human and anti-anatomic. We are not designed to dance like that.’ Royal Ballet star Carlos Acosta on why he’s pleased to retire aged 42 Jeremy Clarkson, who punched a Top Gear producer after he was refused a hot supper at a hotel in Yorkshire, now seems to be inspiring violence by diners at one of London’s most fashionable restaurants. The motormouth presenter was at Colbert in Sloane Square on Thursday when one of his fellow customers, a middle-aged blonde in a red dress, suddenly left and started dancing on the roof of a 4x4 parked outside. Luckily for the ‘Chelsea tractor’ owner, she was barefoot. Five minutes later, she burst out again, designer sunglasses in hand, and this time climbed on the roof of a passing vehicle, to gasps from diners. This was too much for one eyewitness, who flagged down a police car. ‘She grabbed the maitre d’ by the throat with both hands and kicked the policeman when he arrived,’ says a source at Colbert. ‘She was not a regular customer and still had the price tag hanging out the back of her dress.’ Say no more.

    "DiffbotBody": "Oral Sex – Blue Valentine (2010) The authenticity in this scene between Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams is the entire reason why Blue Valentine was originally rated NC-17. Enough said. The Affair – Chloe (2009) In this film, a woman (Julianne Moore) hires an escort (Amanda Seyfried) to seduce her husband, and then ends up getting seduced herself, culminating in this steamy scene. Seyfried is seriously at her best, and I would apologize that the clip is in a different language, but I doubt anyone even noticed. Annette \u0026 Sebastian – Cruel Intentions (1999) This cherry-popping scene between Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe is heightened by the fact that these two actors were already in a serious relationship outside the film. The chemistry is tangible, and really makes us wish Reese and Ryan could have somehow made it work. Library Scene – Atonement (2007) Nothing is sexier than two immensely attractive people going at it a few rooms down from a huge dinner party. Cecilia and Robbie really were amazing together, and then stupid Briony had to ruin everything with her lies. WE HATE YOU BRIONY. Well, at least we can watch this scene over and over (and over and over) again and pretend they ended up together. The First Time – Blue Is The Warmest Color (2013) The film tracks the relationship between two women as comes of age while experimenting with a same-sex relationship. This particular scene clocks in at a surprising seven minutes, and features very graphic sex between the two main characters. This one almost didn’t make the list simply because there’s an argument to be made that the scene is actually porn. But it’s technically in a movie, so here it is. Ice Cube Scene – Nine ½ Weeks (1986) In this film starring Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke, the two characters enter into an impersonal affair, featuring this creative use of an ice cube. Tent Scene – Brokeback Mountain (2005) Two cowboys have never been sexier than in this scene when the two protagonists finally put an end to the pent-up sexual tension that exists between the two of them. Piano Scene – Pretty Woman (1990) This scene, between businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) and prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), is great because of how raw Gere and Roberts make it feel. Plus, what’s sexier than a grand piano? Noah \u0026 Allie Make Up Sex – The Notebook (2004) Say what you want about this movie, the sex scene that comes right after the infamous why-didn’t-you-write-me-kissing-in-the-rain bit is great, and another instance where real-life romance translates into amazing on-screen chemistry. Basically Any Sex Scene – Wild Orchid (1989) This scene (start the video at 5:34) is just one of many sex scenes in this film. The film revolves around a young inexperienced woman who enters into a torrid relationship with an older millionaire (wait, this sounds familiar…). Does the film have good dialogue or plot? Not especially. Is it chalk full of erotic scenes? Absolutely. Train Scene – Risky Business (1983) After messing up a college interview, Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) takes Joel (Tom Cruise) onto a deserted train to have sex. The music in combination with the dim lighting makes this scene sexier than we really want scenes with Tom Cruise to be. Spanking Scene – Secretary (2002) It’s 50 Shades of Grey before 50 Shades of Grey. In this film, a young woman gets a job as a secretary where her boss introduces her to the world of S \u0026 M. This scene, which keeps an unusual amount of clothes on for an erotic scene, shows the secretary’s initial sexual awakening.",
    "LabBody": "Oral Sex – Blue Valentine (2010) The authenticity in this scene between Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams is the entire reason why Blue Valentine was originally rated NC-17. Enough said. The Affair – Chloe (2009) In this film, a woman (Julianne Moore) hires an escort (Amanda Seyfried) to seduce her husband, and then ends up getting seduced herself, culminating in this steamy scene. Seyfried is seriously at her best, and I would apologize that the clip is in a different language, but I doubt anyone even noticed. Annette \u0026 Sebastian – Cruel Intentions (1999) This cherry-popping scene between Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe is heightened by the fact that these two actors were already in a serious relationship outside the film. The chemistry is tangible, and really makes us wish Reese and Ryan could have somehow made it work. Library Scene – Atonement (2007) Nothing is sexier than two immensely attractive people going at it a few rooms down from a huge dinner party. Cecilia and Robbie really were amazing together, and then stupid Briony had to ruin everything with her lies. WE HATE YOU BRIONY. Well, at least we can watch this scene over and over (and over and over) again and pretend they ended up together. The First Time – Blue Is The Warmest Color (2013) The film tracks the relationship between two women as comes of age while experimenting with a same-sex relationship. This particular scene clocks in at a surprising seven minutes, and features very graphic sex between the two main characters. This one almost didn’t make the list simply because there’s an argument to be made that the scene is actually porn. But it’s technically in a movie, so here it is. Ice Cube Scene – Nine ½ Weeks (1986) In this film starring Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke, the two characters enter into an impersonal affair, featuring this creative use of an ice cube.",

Lathan resigned Tuesday, a move precipitated by two School Board members, Martha Ross and Lynne Costic, who had placed a measure on today’s meeting agenda to: “1. Consider issuing notice to terminate Superintendent’s contract ... 2. Consider placing Superintendent on administrative leave ... 3. Consider taking final action to hire Interim Superintendent.” It appeared they had the necessary four votes to make that happen, with new board members Dan Adler and Ernestine Jackson — they’ll be seated today — winning election last spring largely on their promises to push for change at the top. This turn of events falls short of surprising, though we had issues with the timing and process, all the same. First, campaign pledges or no, this was not the vote two rookies should have been making minutes after being sworn in. This also may not be the ideal moment to make a switch behind the wheel, with a budget that is hemorrhaging red ink and some very difficult decisions in an unpredictable environment needing to be made. Beyond that, apparently not all the board members were clued in that something this monumental was coming, a communication breakdown that does not bode well. These matters are never pleasant, but motivations have been questioned, as well. In any case, Lathan ultimately spared the board this vote and taxpayers some money, to her credit, as she is leaving under a negotiated settlement described as “gracious.” The details have not been released, but we trust that to mean less than the $100,000 plus compensation for 90 days notice that she stood to receive had the board terminated her contract — with a year remaining — without specific cause. We do hope Lathan is a better fit in her next job and next community than she seemed to be in District 150 and in Peoria, for her sake and for those in her charge.

We do not expect miracles from any single superintendent, especially given District 150’s demographics, longstanding challenges and two-fisted culture. Let’s face it, it’s a difficult place. There have been significant improvements to facilities. We hear of a more efficient central administration. Lathan cited her pride in the expanded International Baccalaureate program, the creation of the Woodruff Career and Technical Center, the teacher evaluation system implemented in collaboration with the union, etc. If she was demanding, she too faced demands — from state and federal governments, for instance — unknown to those who came before. She was brought here as a change agent, which inevitably ruffles feathers. Many may have gotten on board with her goals if her style hadn’t gotten in the way. No doubt there was another side to her — we hear as well of kindnesses to and defenses of individual students — but she didn’t allow many glimpses into that. And after five years, we could not have recommended her retention at the end of this contract in 2016. May all involved here have learned something valuable for the future, and good luck.",

Your own reflexive racism and divisive rhetoric are poisoning public discourse. There's nothing \"progressive\" about attacking the children and grandchildren of immigrants who proudly embrace an American identity. We are not \"self-hating.\" You just hate what we believe. Next week, we'll be celebrating the 239th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The eloquent cries for freedom and equality voiced in that properly revered document have become what professors Sid Milkis and Marc Landy call the \"American Creed.\" It's a belief that all of us have the right to do whatever we want with our lives so long as we don't interfere with the right of others to do the same. Rachel A. Dolezal, the recently resigned president of the Spokane, Washington, office of the NAACP, has come under a bit of controversy. Both of her parents are white, but for eight years, Dolezal claimed that she was black. In addition to her role as president of an NAACP chapter, Dolezal was an instructor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University. I'm impressed by the coolness and steadiness of our media in suppressing any news about immigration. It's as if they've built a triple-layer fence with border guards around immigration topics. And guess what? Their fence is working! I have often maintained that threats to freedom of expression in this country come predominantly — probably exclusively — from the political left.

    "DiffbotBody": "The goal of the renovation is to activate all sides of the three-block-long mall. PREIT plans to install restaurants and food stores on the back side of the Gallery along Filbert Street. The company sees Filbert as a good place to extend the energy of the Reading Terminal Market and Chinatown, and wants pedestrianize the street, creating an intimate, walkable epicurean row. To accomplish such a dramatic transformation, PREIT acknowledges that the bus station and parking garage would have to be improved – or even removed. We know plenty of facts about the renovation of Philadelphia's dysfunctional Gallery. We know the cost ($325 million). We know what the city and state are coughing up to help the developers realize the transformation ($148.5 million). We even know that the old pushcart vendors have been guaranteed spots in the reconfigured mall. And yet we know almost nothing about the architecture. Through months of discussion about the city's financial contribution to the project, Philadelphians were shown only a single hazy rendering of what the Gallery's new Market Street facade would look like after the big white whale of a mall goes under the knife and reemerges as the \"Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia.\" But based on never-before-seen images and a promotional video that were provided by the developers - Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Macerich Co. - it now seems safe to say that the dowdy Gallery will emerge from its surgery looking fresher and more sophisticated. Along with modernizing the '70s-era interior, the images reveal that the developers are exploring ways to transform the massive retail box into the centerpiece of a 24/7 neighborhood. Their ideas include putting apartment towers on the roof and creating a pedestrian-friendly epicurean row on Filbert Street, now the mall's forlorn back wall. PREIT/Macerich are promising the Gallery’s Market Street façade will undergo the most dramatic transformation. The existing amphitheater at Ninth Street will be eliminated and replaced by a sidewalk-level plaza, leading to a streamlined, glass entrance cube designed by JPRA Architects. This rendering shows a new retail space facing the plaza, in what is now an open-air arcade. PREIT wants to break open the Gallery’s blank façade and replace it with a continuous row of shops, each with its own front doors and large display windows. The shopfronts will be trimmed in dark gray granite and a limestone-like material. Most shops will be two stories and have generous second-floor windows. The cubes represent the locations where the digital signs will be placed. Should these proposals be realized, the Gallery would no doubt become a catalyst to lift up the whole East Market corridor. Unfortunately, the new images also make it clear that PREIT already has exaggerated how much its problematic building can be improved. The facade rendering presented to the public in April suggests the mall's solid Market Street walls would be torn off and replaced with a continuous row of two-story shops with large display windows and street-facing doors. But during an interview with PREIT's top executive, Joseph Coradino, and designer James Grigsby of JPRA Architects, they acknowledged that this welcoming frontage is probably impossible to achieve. The truth is that the row of stores will not be continuous. Most of the existing blank expanses on Market Street, and some on Filbert, will remain blank. Because renderings are intended as a visual sales pitch, they must always be treated with caution. In the Market Street rendering, the mall's new face was presented from a hundred paces, as if someone had drawn the picture from the parking lot at Eighth Street. You can identify a few key changes - a new glass entrance cube, a small plaza, some grayish accents. But make no mistake: Fashion Outlets will be just as much of a mall as the Gallery. The Gallery was built to support several large towers. As part of the mall’s reinvention, PREIT is exploring the possibility of constructing three mid-rise towers on top of the building. The company will start with the eastern-most tower. It is seeking a development partner to construct an apartment house at Ninth Street, with a residential lobby facing Filbert Street. The two other towers would come later. Of course, nobody expected the Gallery renovation to solve all of the building's problems. Conceived in the '70s, when downtowns sought to emulate suburban malls, the design virtually ignores Market Street. Shoppers were expected to access the mall from the underground trains or through a sky bridge connected to the adjacent parking garages. Although the mall stretches from Ninth to 11th Streets, there are only a handful of shop windows at street level. PREIT's goal has always been to open up the uninviting facade. By turning the mall inside-out, they believe they can help restore Market Street as a traditional shopping corridor. Because two other Market Street projects - the Lit Bros. renovation and a mixed-use development at 12th Street - are also in the mix, much is riding on the success of the Fashion Outlets. Two Philadelphia streets pass under the Gallery, Ninth and 10th. Now gloomy tunnels, they will be brightened with better lighting and improved sidewalk treatments. Walls that are now solid will be retrofitted with large display windows. As important as it is to make the Gallery feel more approachable, PREIT expects that most of its new tenants - 125 in total - will be located inside the mall. For that reason, it wants to improve the main entrance at Ninth Street. The plan is to demolish the existing amphitheater, which forces people to enter the mall through its underground concourse. In its place, PREIT will build a street-level plaza, leading to a glass portal. In the rendering of the transparent cube, we see an enticing new retail space spilling onto the plaza. Alas, it is an illusion. The problem, PREIT concedes, is that a big chunk of the 12-bay Market Street facade is already claimed by non-retail uses. Take the area immediately west of the plaza. That space is leased by Health Partners Plans. Although its offices are on the mall's upper floors, the company's lobby occupies three storefront bays at street level along Market, two of them blank walls. West of the lobby, there are three more blank bays for the mall's exit doors. Many of the blank walls serve to hide SEPTA's transit infrastructure. Here’s what PREIT/Macerich are up against: Nearly half the ground-floor façade is taken up by non-retail uses. In this photo SERIES, you can see the entrance to Health Partners Plans, which has offices on the second and third floors of the mall. Two of the bays flanking the doors are blank walls and will remain so after the renovation. Immediately to the west are three more blank bays, occupied by exit doors. Architect James Grigsby says he will use graphics to camouflage the doors if they cannot be removed. When Grigsby, who led the redesign of the Cherry Hill Mall, was asked how he would deal with those problematic bays, he said they could always be disguised with graphics. If that's the solution, the Gallery renovation will look no better than the exterior of the existing Walgreen's - long expanses of dead space. PREIT faces a similar challenge between 10th and 11th Streets, where the facade also is consumed by exit doors. It's too bad because the additional renderings show that PREIT's ambitions go beyond the cosmetic. JPRA's neutral palette and industrial-chic aesthetic suggest the developer envisions a more urbane environment, one that will appeal to design-savvy shoppers as well as bargain hunters. Coradino said the company is now seeking a partner to help build the first of three possible towers, starting with a mid-rise apartment house on the northeast corner of Ninth and Market. Its plan to make Filbert more pedestrian-friendly, by adding restaurants and food stores, and piggybacking off the popularity of the Reading Terminal and Chinatown, also should help alter our perceptions of that underappreciated side street. PREIT expects to lease space to about 125 tenants, down from the original 150 that populated the mall. Instead of large anchor stores like Kmart, there will be smaller retailers. One advantage of eliminating the anchor stores is that PREIT will be able to create a continuous corridor on the second level, with retail spaces on either side. In keeping with current retail trends, JPRA Architects plans to give the mall’s new interior a neutral palette, accented by industrial-chic materials that evoke steel and wood. The walls will be white, the floors a dark gray. And yet, with all the focus on upgrading the Gallery's sidewalk appeal, no one has paid much attention to the sidewalks themselves. To make the Fashion Outlet's new street-facing shops handicapped-accessible, PREIT has asked for permission to annex part of the Market Street sidewalk to build ramps for its new stores. The city should tell the developer those structures belong inside the shops, not in the public right-of-way. After the renovation, patrons arriving at Ninth Street will still enter a soaring light-filled space. But they will find a new set of escalators on the Ninth Street side, leading to the second level. The JPRA design calls for adding several bridges across the central atrium to make it easier to move through the mall. Getting customers to the third floor has always been a problem. PREIT hopes to lure them there by making it an entertainment zone with restaurants, bocce courts, a sports bar and perhaps a movie theater. PREIT also hopes to install a restaurant at street level, on the northeast corner of Ninth and Market, across from the plaza, in the space now occupied by a drug store. PREIT's treatment of the sidewalks raises another issue. Although Market Street is being remade by the three major construction projects, each one is planning its own set of sidewalk furnishings. This go-it-alone approach will surely result in a hodgepodge of fixtures on the renovated blocks, while the unimproved blocks will be left with the same broken elements. What we need is a coordinated plan for upgrading the sidewalks from City Hall to Independence Mall. It's not unreasonable to expect such civic-minded improvements given the windfall that Council bestowed on these property owners when it allowed digital signs on East Market. In the end, we will judge the renovations not by the bargains we find inside the Gallery's sleek new interior, but by how much of the bustling urban streetscape depicted in the pretty pictures actually comes to life.",

JPRA's neutral palette and industrial-chic aesthetic suggest the developer envisions a more urbane environment, one that will appeal to design-savvy shoppers as well as bargain hunters. Coradino said the company is now seeking a partner to help build the first of three possible towers, starting with a mid-rise apartment house on the northeast corner of Ninth and Market. Its plan to make Filbert more pedestrian-friendly, by adding restaurants and food stores, and piggybacking off the popularity of the Reading Terminal and Chinatown, also should help alter our perceptions of that underappreciated side street. And yet, with all the focus on upgrading the Gallery's sidewalk appeal, no one has paid much attention to the sidewalks themselves. To make the Fashion Outlet's new street-facing shops handicapped-accessible, PREIT has asked for permission to annex part of the Market Street sidewalk to build ramps for its new stores. The city should tell the developer those structures belong inside the shops, not in the public right-of-way. PREIT's treatment of the sidewalks raises another issue. Although Market Street is being remade by the three major construction projects, each one is planning its own set of sidewalk furnishings. This go-it-alone approach will surely result in a hodgepodge of fixtures on the renovated blocks, while the unimproved blocks will be left with the same broken elements. What we need is a coordinated plan for upgrading the sidewalks from City Hall to Independence Mall. It's not unreasonable to expect such civic-minded improvements given the windfall that Council bestowed on these property owners when it allowed digital signs on East Market. In the end, we will judge the renovations not by the bargains we find inside the Gallery's sleek new interior, but by how much of the bustling urban streetscape depicted in the pretty pictures actually comes to life.",

He writhed in pain for several moments until a doctor popped his knee back into place on the court. Even then, the chances of him returning that season appeared bleak. Other Finalists Javier Alfaro, Santa Cruz, Sr.: Prolific goal scorer earned Player of the Year honors after racking up a Santa Cruz County-record 45 goals — shattering the previous mark of 34 — to go along with 25 assists in leading the Cardinals to the SCCAL title. Fineas Del Bonta-Smith, Soquel, Sr.: Three-sport athlete was a standout in football, in which he was first-team all-SCCAL punter; in basketball, in which he received all-league honorable mention; and in baseball, in which he was named Pitcher of the Year and will compete at University of the Pacific. Nate Gentry, San Lorenzo Valley, Sr.: Suffered a broken collarbone his junior season but returned to field as a senior and earned a first-team all-SCCAL selection for baseball and co-Offensive Player of the Year for football. Dante Gomez, Aptos, Sr.: A beast on the football field while anchoring the Mariners’ stingy defense and earning co-MVP honors, linebacker-turned-forward on the basketball court and earned a second team all-SCCAL selection. Nate Pisciotta, Harbor, Sr.: Goalkeeper of the Year in soccer after earning an all-league nod the previous two years; was also a first-team (and All-County) selection for baseball after hitting .394 with 25 RBIs. Christian Rebottaro, MVC, Jr.: Lineman used his size and strength first toward earning Defensive MVP honors in the MBL-P, then became the Mustangs’ first section champion in wrestling at heavyweight, a division in which he placed fifth at state. Deane Rinaldi, Harbor, Sr.: Loyola Marymount-bound golfer was a three-time SCCAL MVP — he was named Freshman MVP his first year — who ultimately reached NorCal championships this season and fell two strokes shy of reaching state; also a two-time all-league selection in basketball. Galen Sloss, Pacific Collegiate, Jr.: Named Most Valuable Player of the MTAL-C in soccer after recording 15 goals and leading the Pumas to a second straight league title, was also a first-team selection in lacrosse while leading the Pumas to the MTAL Tournament semifinals. Max Somple, Soquel, Sr.: Powerful in the pool, UC Davis-bound water polo player earned MVP honors in the MBL-G after registering 132 goals, 64 assists and 66 steals for the Knights, and also earned a league swimming title in the 100-yard free. Kaijae Yee-Stephens, Santa Cruz, Jr.: High-scoring guard — a first team all-SCCAL selection — averaged 21.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.9 assists to help lead the Cardinals to their first CCS championship since 2005. Instead, in what was a sign of his work ethic and toughness, he missed all of five games. “When I was laying on the court, it was definitely scary. I knew it was my knee,” Dorfman said, before later adding, “I was lucky.” Dorfman’s senior campaign was not one of heartbreak. He was named Most Valuable Player of the SCCAL while leading the basketball team, earned a first team all-SCCAL selection while holding together the volleyball team. He was a second-team all-Central Coast Section selection for basketball, and was later named the Senior Athlete of the Year at Aptos High. Today, the Sentinel pads Dorfman’s resume, naming the UC Santa Cruz-bound hoopster the Boys Athlete of the Year for 2015. Dorfman said he put in a lot of hard work during the offseason and owed his success to the great coaches and great teammates that pushed him along the way. He also has a competitive spirit that he credits to his mother, Tracie, and father, Mark, who is also the school’s athletic director and an assistant coach for the football team. “I just wanted to be the best,” Dorfman said. “I hate losing.” Dorfman averaged 15.7 points overall to go along with 7.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 2.4 steals per game for the Mariners basketball team. He deposited a season-high 29 points — 23 in the second half — in a CCS semifinal against Burlingame that sent Aptos to its first section final since 1987. “He’s the unquestioned leader of our team and he exemplifies everything that we want of our players,” Aptos coach Joseph Smith said of Dorfman in March. Dorfman averaged 21.4 points in the postseason. The late hoops season, which saw Aptos finish with a 23-8 overall record, forced Dorfman to miss the first eight matches of the volleyball season. But the middle hitter nevertheless made his presence felt, providing 23 digs during a key, two-match slate against rivals Mount Madonna and Pacific Collegiate that helped pave the way toward an SCCAL title for the Mariners. “We definitely stepped up and exceeded expectations,” Dorfman said of the volleyball team, which reached the CCS D-II final. Dorfman was almost a three-sport athlete. He played football during his freshman and sophomore years, ultimately dropping the sport to better focus on basketball — his passion. The extra time that would have been spent hitting the sled during the summer months was used hitting countless jumpers in the gymnasium, where Dorfman worked on ball handling, shooting and all facets in between. It clearly paid off. “After sophomore year, I decided to put my effort into basketball and focus on that, and try to play that in college,” said Dorfman, who graduated Aptos with a 4.18 grade-point average. He’s considering a career in marine biology and plans to study environmental sciences at UCSC, where he’ll also play on the basketball team. “I missed (football). I missed playing with all my friends,” Dorfman added. “But I wouldn’t change it.” Contact Andrew Matheson at 831-706-3272.",

    "DiffbotBody": "We’ve been publishing our guides to the best movies and TV shows on Netflix for three years now, and the selections keep improving. More than half of the movies in our 2014 edition are new from last year, and they pull from a variety of styles—romantic comedies, action flicks, indie dramas, blockbuster sci-fi, documentaries, animated films and more. And if you already know what kind of movie you’re in the mood for, check out our genre-specific guides, as well: 101. Forrest Gump Year: 1994 Director: Robert Zemeckis Few films infiltrate the collective American psyche quite the way Forrest Gump managed. You’ve undoubtedly heard someone make reference to this 1994 classic—whether it was a classmate sarcastically yelling “Run, Forrest, run!” as you hustled to catch the bus, or someone busting out their best drawl to deliver, “Momma always said life is like a box of chocolates.” The entire film is full of dialogue that’s both moving and funny (my personal favorites include “But Lt. Dan, you ain’t got no legs” and “I’m sorry I had a fight at your Black Panther party”). Forrest may be a simple man, but his story is our nation’s story, and we all are run through the emotional gauntlet as we watch him hang with Elvis and John Lennon, fight in Vietnam and encounter many a civic protest—all while in pursuit of his true love, Jenny. Tom Hanks delivers an Oscar-winning performance, and Gary Sinise is heartbreaking as Lt. Dan.—Bonnie Stiernberg 100. Let the Fire Burn Year: 2013 Director: Jason Osder On May 13, 1985, a deadly altercation broke out in Philadelphia between police and a radical organization called MOVE, resulting in 11 deaths and the destruction of several city blocks. First-time filmmaker Jason Osder’s riveting documentary brilliantly re-creates that day entirely through live local broadcasts and a televised city hearing months later that investigated who was at fault. Let the Fire Burn is a found-footage landmark that presents a troubling commentary on race relations in America that remain distressingly unresolved. Perhaps even more impressively, though, Osder’s film doubles as a moving, engrossing courtroom thriller populated with unexpected heroes and fascinating, nuanced insights into how human beings behave in a crisis.—Tim Grierson 99. Spaceballs No longer streaming on Netflix Year: 1987 Director: Mel Brooks Originally perceived as one of writer/director Mel Brooks’ lesser works, this loving send-up of the sci-fi/fantasy genre (specifically, Star Wars) has, over the years, wormed its way into the hearts of a new generation of fans who caught it on video. “May the Schwartz be with you,” “Ludicrous Speed,” “Mawg”—if these are all terms that mean nothing to you then it’s high-time you checked this movie out and see what all the fuss is about.—Mark Rozeman 98. Safety Not Guaranteed Year: 2012 Director: Colin Trevorrow At the last few Sundance Film Festivals, a running joke has developed about the ubiquity of Mark Duplass. It seems like if he’s not writing and directing an independent film with his brother Jay (Cyrus, Jeff, Who Lives at Home), he’s producing and/or starring in another. But while indie film fans may feel like they’ve gotten a handle on Duplass’s hipster vibe, his performance in Safety Not Guaranteed shows that he can be mysterious as well as funny, brooding as well as charming.—Jeremy Matthews 97. The Fisher King No longer streaming on Netflix as of Sept. 1, 2014 Year: 1991 Director: Terry Gilliam Many of Robin Williams’ characters dangle perilously close to the edge of sanity, but Parry has been pushed right off that cliff in The Fisher King. Terry Gilliam’s Arthurian tale is set in the present, but it still takes a fantastical journey for Jeff Bridges’ disgraced talk-show host and Williams’ homeless widower to find The Holy Grail, sweet Lydia and redemption.—Josh Jackson 96. M*A*S*H Year: 1970 Director: Robert Altman Considering that it became the basis of a beloved (and long-running) CBS sitcom, it’s easy to forget how revolutionary the original M*A*S*H film was at the time of its release. Certainly, more than 40 years after it first scandalized moviegoers, this 1970 black comedy about the exploits of a Korean War-era surgical hospital not only stands as one of the most subversive portraits of war ever put to film but also as one of the flat-out, most hilarious movies ever made. Boasting a script consisting almost entirely of improv, a major comedic set piece centered on a suicide attempt and the first utterance of the word “fuck” in a mainstream film, M*A*S*H redefined the American comedy and promptly secured director Robert Altman’s status as the ultimate actor’s director.—Mark Rozeman 95. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Year: 2003 Director: Gore Verbinski Daring to base the central character of a Disney franchise on a notorious junkie-alcoholic walking-corpse rock star like Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards was a coup, but even more mind-blowing was how well Depp’s crazy idea worked. Guzzling rum as he bobs and weaves—stumbles, really—through this film delivering hilariously slurred one-liners, he is the consummate goodhearted scoundrel, easily stealing every frame he flamboyantly swaggers across.—Steve LaBate 94. The Fifth Element Year: 1997 Director: Luc Besson The Fifth Element is the ultimate display of what would happen if someone with the sci-fi enthusiasm of a teenage boy wrote a big-budget Hollywood script, which is exactly the case here. Set in 23rd century New York City, taxi driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) gets wrapped up in saving the world with his passenger Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), the fifth and final piece that is needed to protect earth. Entertaining, thrilling, and visually fantastical, The Fifth Element is worth every minute of your time.—Caitlin Colford 93. Let the Right One In Year: 2008 Director: Tomas Alfredson Vampire stories are plastered all over American pop culture these days (True Blood, Twilight, The Vampire Diaries), but leave it to the Swedes to produce a vampire film that manages to be both sweet and frightening. The friendship between Oskar, a scrawny, 12-year-old outcast, and Eli, a centuries-old vampire frozen in the body of a child, is a chilling but beautiful story to behold.—Jeremy Medina 92. Charade Year: 1963 Director: Stanley Donen Cary Grant is the most charming male lead ever. Audrey Hepburn is the most charming female lead ever. Everything else is just bonus in this romantic thriller about a woman pursued in Paris for her late husband’s stolen fortune: the Henry Mancini score, the Hitchcock-ian suspense, the plot twists and Walter Mathau as a CIA agent.—Michael Dunaway 91. The Constant Gardener Year: 2005 Director: Fernando Meirelles In The Constant Gardener, diplomacy is overstepped by both those with corrupt intentions and those who see it as a bureaucratic divide to human charity. Combining the oft-convoluted storytelling of novelist John Le Carré and the violently dazzling visuals of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (City of God), its message is emboldened by the failure of its well-intentioned characters to intervene in the robbed lives of others.—Cameron Bird 90. The Trip Year: 2011 Director: Michael Winterbottom Two British actor/comedians playing versions of themselves travel the beautiful and bleak north England countryside, stopping to eat at various upscale restaurants, but mostly just talking. And talking and talking. And doing impressions of Michael Caine, Woody Allen, and Liam Neeson, as well as British personalities an American audience might not recognize. But mostly just talking, with overlapping affection and competition. Sound like a good idea for a film? It absolutely is.—Jonah Flicker 89. Days of Being Wild Year: 1990 Director: Wong Kar Wai It’s a crying shame that In the Mood for Love isn’t also available on Netflix, because it would certainly rank near the top of this list. But this film, described as an “informal prequel” is worthy enough on its own as well. It’s also got Maggie Chen and Tony Leung, but the star turn here is from Leslie Cheung as Yuddy, the Lothario leaving a trail of broken hearts in his wake. The tone is certainly more on the bitter end of bittersweet, but Wong Kar-wai’s directorial voice, of a man who believes in love, shines through loud and strong.—Michael Dunaway 88. The English Patient Year: 1996 Director: Anthony Minghella It wasn’t just Elaine Benes who thought that The English Patient was overrated and boring: Even at the time of its Oscar win, this period romantic epic was being criticized in some quarters for its self-consciously old-school sweep. To which its fans say, “Yeah, so?” A stellar “They don’t make ’em like this anymore” movie, filmmaker Anthony Minghella’s adaptation of Michael Ondaatje’s novel starred Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas as the most poignantly star-crossed big-screen lovers since Ilsa walked backed into Rick’s life. Beautifully shot, sensitively acted, romantically overpowering, The English Patient is way, way better than Sack Lunch.—Tim Grierson 87. Short Term 12 Director: Destin Cretton As it progresses, Short Term 12 remains rigorously structured in terms of plot; yet it never feels calculated. In fact, the film serves as a fine example of how invisible screenwriting can be. By allowing his characters’ irrational emotions to influence events and instigate key turning points, Cretton capably masks the film’s finely calibrated story mechanics. And while everything seemingly comes to a head during a key crisis, it’s only fitting that the story ends with a denouement that bookends its opening. Cretton’s clear-eyed film is far too honest to try and convince us that there’s been any sort of profound change for Grace or anyone else. Instead, it’s content to serve as a potent reminder that tentative first steps can be every bit as narratively compelling as great leaps of faith.—Curtis Woloschuk 86. Barton Fink Year: 1991 Director: Joel Coen While hung up with the intricate plotting of Miller’s Crossing, The Coen Brothers took a break to write a script about a blocked screenwriter (Jon Turturro). Reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch at their most darkly satiric, Barton Fink depicts a self-important New York playwright who struggles to write a Hollywood wrestling picture while residing in a rotting hotel. A jaundiced metaphor for the compromised creative process of show business, Barton Fink delivers the deadpan comedy and quirky performances of the Coens’ trademark, including Oscar nominee Michael Lerner as a bombastic studio chief, John Mahoney as a boozing, Faulkner-esque novelist, and John Goodman as a cheerful salesman with a dark secret. Audiences can obsess over the meaning of lines like Goodman’s “I’ll show you the life of the mind!” but any answers the film holds are unlikely to be reassuring.—Curt Holman 85. Say Anything… Year: 1989 Director: Cameron Crowe In his directorial debut, Cameron Crowe places one of the all-time charming film courtships within that strangely insular time, mid-transition, between high school and college (or career or family). In Lloyd Dobler, the defining role of John Cusack’s career, Crowe presents an appealing, convincing everyman whose pursuit of a girl (Ione Skye), supposedly out of his league, reveals how foolish such handicapping can be in the first place. Though Crowe would go on to create a number of career-launching roles for women (Renee Zellweger and Kate Hudson should thank him, daily), in Say Anything, Dobler rules.—Michael Burgin 84. The Cabin in the Woods Year: 2011 Director: Drew Goddard For a movie chock-full of twists, perhaps the biggest is that despite all appearances to the contrary, The Cabin in the Woods is a heartfelt love story. Mind you, not between any of the young and pretty college students who tempt fate at the cabin in question. No, this romance is between creators Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, and the scary-movie genre as a whole. A ménage à terror, if you will. Like Scream before it, the film is a simultaneous dissection and celebration of all the tropes to which it pays homage, while also managing to be a superb example of the genre in its own right. The script is vintage Whedon—smart, funny and surprising. Thanks to Goddard’s direction and staging, and despite the film’s very focus on the formulaic nature of horror, it still manages to be tense, atmospheric and jump-out-of-your-seat scary. The Cabin in the Woods may very well be the ultimate schlocky little horror movie.—Dan Kaufman 83. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly Year: 2007 Director: Julian Schnabel In 1995, French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby suffered a horrific stroke that left his entire body paralyzed in what doctors call the “locked-in syndrome.” In a remarkable testament to the human spirit, Bauby was able to dictate a 132-page memoir by blinking his left eye. Incredibly, ace-auteur Julian Schnabel adapted that memoir into a breathtaking, lyrical, haunting film that is as much his creation as Bauby’s. (Kudos to the Academy for recognizing Schnabel’s brilliance with a Best Director nomination.) The Diving Bell is not only a testament to the human spirit, but to the power of cinema as well.—Jeremy Medina 82. Glengarry Glen Ross Year: 1992 Director: James Foley Surely somewhere on the Internet there’s a catalog of all the potboiler plays that have been turned into lifeless movies; wherein the minimal settings came off as flat rather than intimate or claustrophobic, and the surgically written prose came off as stilted rather than impassioned. Glengarry Glen Ross is the exception and the justification for all noble stage-to-screen attempts since. This adaptation of David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize winning play about workingman’s inhumanity to workingman still crackles today, and its best lines (and there are many) have become ingrained in the angrier sections of our collective zeitgeist. James Foley directs the playwright’s signature cadence better than the man himself, and the all-star cast give performances they’ve each only hoped to match since. Mamet, for his part, managed to elevate his already stellar material with his screenplay, adding the film’s most iconic scene, the oft-quoted Blake speech brilliantly delivered by Alec Baldwin. This is a film worthy of a cup of coffee and, as we know, coffee is for closers only.—Bennett Webber 81. The Talented Mr. Ripley Year: 1999 Director: Anthony Minghella Many doubted anyone could do justice to the Ripley novels on celluloid, but Anthony Minghella proved them wrong in spectacular fashion. Lushly photographed, exquisitely art-directed and impeccably timed (not a scene is a moment too long or too short), it intrigues and bewilders like Hitchcock’s best work. Career performances from Matt Damon and Jude Law, plus wonderful turns from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett—and the last time Gwenyth Paltrow was bearable. A frightful—and frightfully overlooked—film.—Michael Dunaway 80. Kagemusha Year: 1980 Director: Akira Kurosawa Like Rashomon before it, Akira Kurosawa’s Kagemusha proves the director is as much a master of story plotting as he is perfectionist over the smallest technical nuances in his films—though here, he’s painting on a far grander canvas. Not long after the peak of their relevance, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola helped secure financing for Kurosawa to finally film this extraordinary, sweeping epic, with both admitting to owing the filmmaker a huge debt as an influence. That alone is excuses an Ewok (and Jack) or two.—Scott Wold 79. The Hunger Games Year: 2012 Director: Gary Ross Suzanne Collins’ futuristic dystopian society comes to life in the long-awaited debut of The Hunger Games. But it’s Jennifer Lawrence’s performance as Katniss Everdeen, the 16-year-old protagonist who unapologetically puts her life on the line to save her sister and challenge the twisted logic of the government, that has singlehandedly launched the inescapable book-turned-movie franchise. Fans of the books won’t be disappointed. With few exceptions, director Gary Ross doesn’t veer too far from Collins’ novel. It’s rare that a film based on a Young Adult novel is able to juggle so many powerful issues so profoundly, but Ross finds a way to translate Collins’ imaginative plots into a visually triumphant, emotional roller coaster of economic struggle, class warfare, politics, sacrifice, independent thinking and rebellion without compromising too much of the original manuscript.—Maggie Coughlan 78. The Act of Killing Year: 2012 Director: Joshua Oppenheimer Some tragedies are so horrific that it’s hard to reconcile one’s belief in the basic decency of human beings with the atrocities that some of them have perpetrated. Documentary filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing focuses on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, speaking to some members of the Indonesian death squads who slaughtered hundreds of thousands of their countrymen and women in 1965 and ’66. These people don’t live in the shadows, though: They’re treated like royalty in their native land, celebrated as heroes who helped “save” Indonesia from communism. The film is so shocking and depressing that its subjects’ utter disconnection from morality would almost be funny if it wasn’t so frightening.—Tim Grierson 77. In Bruges Year: 2008 Director: Martin McDonagh You know you’ve tripped into the ambiguous realm of Postmodernism when medieval Europe, midget jokes and ultraviolence converge into a seamless whole. Theater auteur Martin McDonagh’s debut feature, In Bruges, thrives on these stylistic clashes with its narrative of two sympathetic hitmen who seek refuge in a European wonderland full of tourists and irony. The ﬁlm excels, painting its story through the extreme juxtaposition of its subjects, with each contrasting plot element not only understood but felt visually. This technique pits staccato violence against the surreal camera pans of Bruges’ fairy-tale cityscape, projecting the internal conﬂict of hired killers Ken and Ray against their new, pacifying environment. The ﬁlm’s visual appeal complements irreverent and hilarious dialogue—timed brilliantly with the Anglo-Saxon bravado of Fiennes, Farrell and Gleeson—to produce one of this holiday season’s most pleasant dark-horse dramadies.—Sean Edgar 76. Serenity Year: 2005 Director: Joss Whedon We may have never gotten a Season 2 of Firefly, the much beloved alien-free space-travel show from Joss Whedon. But at least we got a movie. In Serenity, River Tam (Summer Glau) got to really stretch her legs, kicking the asses of all kinds of Alliance baddies. And Browncoats everywhere rejoiced.—Josh Jackson 75. In the Loop Year: 2009 Director: Armando Iannucci If clever verbal humor were easy, we’d have more comedies like In the Loop. But it’s not, and this one stands in a class of its own. It’s the most quotable film of the decade—by miles—and the cynical potty mouths on screen are so articulate and creative that, after the avalanche of witticisms, you’re left with the lingering sense that you’ve seen not just a funny movie but also a wicked political satire of the highest order, the kind where the absurdity speaks for itself.—Robert Davis 74. The Long Goodbye No longer streaming on Netflix as of Sept. 1, 2014 Year: 1973 Director: Robert Altman To me, Altman was the best director of the 1970s, and while it’s a small tragedy that none of his other films from that decade are available on Netflix Instant, we can at least be grateful that The Long Goodbye made the cut. Starring Elliott Gould as a private eye, it showcases the actor as something other than the soft, whiny old man viewers of our generation know from shows like Friends and Ray Donovan. Under Altman’s care, here and in M*A*S*H, he’s nothing less than a badass with a cynical edge. You won’t recognize him, but you will wonder why he failed to become a leading man of the Nicholson/Pacino/Hackman variety. The story, adapted from a Raymond Chandler novel, is dark, intriguing, and ultimately just a little amoral. Like the rest of the great ‘70s film, The Long Goodbye had little use for virtue.—Shane Ryan 73. Frances Ha Director: Noah Baumbach Frances Ha is endearing, kind and, in many ways, Noah Baumbach’s best movie to date. One could trace his films, from his debut (Kicking and Screaming) to his most recent (Greenberg) and see a slow but steady focus on the individual, as well as his abandonment of an ironic, sometimes caustic stance against the very characters he writes. It is as if Baumbach could only write a certain type of person—the privileged, socially crippled intellectual with either too much self-awareness or none at all—and for a while it seemed like even the writer himself couldn’t stand to be in the same room with such characters. This anger has faded, and what has emerged over his last few films, and culminated in Frances Ha, is an embrace of not only the flaws of his characters, but also his flaws as a filmmaker. He has settled down and created a film imbued with love, fun and melancholy. It feels simple and open and is a joy to watch.—Joe Peeler 72. Y Tu Mama Tambien Director: Alfonso Cuarón Year: 2001 A road trip along the coast of Mexico turns out to be one of sexual discovery for two punk teenagers (Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna). Meanwhile, the trip turns out to be the bittersweet final adventure for their older female companion (Maribel Verdu), as she struggles with a life full of regret and roads not yet traveled. Y Tu Mama Tambien is at times playful and seductive, but slowly reveals itself to be a substantive dual story involving both coming-of-age and coming-to-terms.—Jeremy Medina 71. Life Is Beautiful Year: 1997 Director: Roberto Benigni Italian writer, director, actor and concentrated ball of exuberance Roberto Benigni brought comedy to a story of a Nazi concentration camp without downplaying the tragedy. We all want to give our children their childhood, and his character’s efforts to do just that make the horror all the more relatable. The film tugs at heartstrings, but Benigni plays them so well, you’ll forgive any hint of emotional manipulation.—Josh Jackson 70. The Italian Job Year: 2003 Director: F. Gary Gray The Italian Job is different from other heist movies in that it’s not all about the money or even the challenge of just trying to steal something without getting caught. Thought it still has the requisite wise-cracking and motley- yet-somehow close-knit-crew of thieves like countless other heist movies, The Italian Job is more about betrayal and revenge. Plus, Mini Coopers have never looked so cool.—Anita George 69. Bernie Year: 2011 Director: Richard Linklater Bernie is as much about the town of Carthage, Texas, as it is about its infamous resident Bernie Tiede (Jack Black), the town’s mortician and prime suspect in the murder of one of its most despised citizens, Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine). Unlike Nugent, Bernie is conspicuously loved by all. When he’s not helping direct the high school musical, he’s teaching Sunday school. Like a well-played mystery, Linklater’s excellent, darkly humorous (and true) story is interspersed with tantalizing interviews of the community’s residents. Linklater uses real East Texas folks to play the parts, a device that serves as the perfect balance against the drama that leads up to Bernie’s fatal encounter with the rich bitch of a widow. The comedy is sharp, with some of the film’s best lines coming from those townsfolk.—Tim Basham 68. The Nightmare Before Christmas Year: 1993 Director: Henry Selick On simply a shot-by-shot basis, The Nightmare Before Christmas ranks as one of the most visually splendid films ever made. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, becomes obsessed with Christmas and decides to hijack the holiday. Often presented under the title Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, the film echoes many of the hit director’s pet themes, with Jack being one of Burton’s many brooding artistic protagonists. The film’s actual director was Henry Selick, who oversees an ingenious design and a cast of endearing monsters. The film doesn’t quite have the narrative fuel and graceful song lyrics to match Disney’s best animated musicals, but every year the film looks better and better.—Curt Holman 67. The Brother From Another Planet Year: 1984 Director: John Sayles During the ’80s, John Sayles established himself as a smart indie writer/director with a knack for social commentary. But only one of his films embedded said commentary into a zany sci-fi plot. The result is the story of a mute alien who looks like a black man with weird feet, who crash-lands in Harlem and meets and observes the people of New York City. Joe Morton gives a stellar silent performance that, like the film itself, seamlessly moves from comic to empathetic.—Jeremy Mathews 66. Blue is the Warmest Color Year: 2013 Director: Abdellatif Kechiche Three-hour movies usually are the terrain of Westerns, period epics or sweeping, tragic romances. They don’t tend to be intimate character pieces, but Blue Is the Warmest Color (La Vie D’Adèle Chapitres 1 et 2) more than justifies its length. A beautiful, wise, erotic, devastating love story, this tale of a young lesbian couple’s beginning, middle and possible end utilizes its running time to give us a full sense of two individuals growing together and apart over the course of years. It hurts like real life, yet leaves you enraptured by its power.—Tim Grierson 65. Dead Man Year: 1995 Director: Jim Jarmusch Jim Jarmusch directed this post-modern examination of the western film genre as American pop culture finally began to veer away from the expected western films. Jarmusch introduced a complete retrospection of a genre plagued with so many social follies. Depp’s somber, quiet character, William Blake, is reflective of the heroes of the Wild West’s past, but it’s his journey that makes this character stand apart.—Clint Alwahab 64. Traffic Year: 2000 Director: Steven Soderbergh Steven Soderbergh’s simulated documentary about modern drug culture twists and glides with a calculation as deep and complex as the cavernous topic it so effectively dissects. Ever the visionary, Soderbergh displays an objective, impartial eye (quite literally—he photographed the film as Peter Andrews), digging into his characters’ explosive trajectories as they reach their tragic and ambiguous ends, and leaving us with more questions than answers.—Sean Edgar 63. Das Boot Year: 1981 Director: Wolfgang Petersen The Germans weigh in on World War II in a positively claustrophobic film set inside a submarine. Wolfgang Petersen’s genius was filming over the course of a year, in sequence. The strain of the production schedule shows on the actors’ faces as the film progresses. By movie’s end, we’re not quite sure who we should be cheering for, which reminds us that on human terms, no one wins a war. —Joan Radell 62. Battleship Potemkin Director: Sergei M. Eisenstein Year: 1925 Because of brutal living conditions, the crew of the Prince Potemkin revolts against their cruel officers, igniting a rebellion in Russia and a violent massacre in Odessa. For the longest time, people considered Battleship Potemkin the greatest achievement in cinema. It may no longer have that acclaim, but it still makes most top ten lists and holds its ground as the greatest propaganda film of all time. At one point a few countries even banned it, afraid of its power to provoke political revolution. Many of its scenes, so visually poignant and thus unforgettable, have been referenced in modern movies like Brazil, The Untouchables and Naked Gun 33 1/3.—David Roark 61. Shakespeare in Love Year: 1998 Director: John Madden Another film whose reputation has suffered somewhat since its initial reception, largely in this case as a result of an ill-considered Oscar and Gweneth Paltrow’s ill-considered management of her public persona since then. No one is more annoyed with latter-day Goop than me, but even I can admit that Shakespeare in Love gets a bad rap. It’s delightful, especially for those with any experience in the theater whatsoever (the theater world itself is the romantic interest of the film, every bit as much as Gweneth’s Viola de Lesseps). And, it’s now safe to say out loud – Ben Affleck is fantastically charming in this film. If you haven’t seen it in awhile, you’ll be surprised at how much more you like it than you remembered.—Michael Dunaway 60. Brokeback Mountain Year: 2005 Director: Ang Lee While his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight certainly deserves the acclaim it’s been given, Heath Ledger’s true tour de force was his understated work in Brokeback Mountain. Ledger brought a driving force to the movie which complimented its contemplative tone and showed a true, classical brilliance in acting that left you convinced that his character was real.—Sean Gandert 59. The King’s Speech Year: 2010 Director: Tom Hooper Acting is a funny thing to judge. Often, the performances we most admire are those where actors stretch themselves the furthest by taking on roles with handicaps. Portraying the stuttering Prince Albert, who would become King George VI of Britain, Colin Firth maintains a constant aura of frustration. It’s not the way that a non-stuttering actor stutters that makes him believable, but the pitch-perfect emotional resonance of gifted actor. And while the performances of his co-stars—Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth and Geoffrey Rush as the king’s Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue—aren’t highlighted by such an obvious physical obstacle, they’re both subtly brilliant. It’s the interplay between all three actors—and the brief scenes with Michael Gambon as King George V—that make Tom Hooper’s film such a joy to watch.—Josh Jackson 58. Blue Valentine Year: 2010 Director: Derek Cianfrance Most films about disintegrating marriages are grim, gray affairs, and filmmakers often use the device as an excuse to punish their audiences. But Blue Valentine is different—the story is told with such overwhelming tenderness and humanity that although the slow unraveling of Dean’s (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy’s (Michelle Williams) love is still heartbreaking, it feels like the director’s heart is breaking along with yours. That’s rare. It doesn’t hurt that Gosling is in top form, or that Williams gives the finest performance of her career. The script was promising enough to win the Chrysler Film Project even before those performances were turned in, and indie favorites Grizzly Bear contributed a haunting soundtrack. There was really nothing in director Derek Cianfrance’s resume to suggest he had such a nuanced, sensitive film in him, but we’ll certainly be watching his career with interest from here on out.—Michael Dunaway 57. Mud Year: 2013 Director: Jeff Nichols In 2011, Jeff Nichols turned heads at Sundance with his second film Take Shelter,as did his fast-rising stars Jessica Chastain and Michael Shannon. He returned two years later with Mud, a coming-of-age thriller about two young boys who encounter a man on the run in rural Arkansas. It’s a sweet tale that displays plenty of faith in humanity without ever veering into sappiness and always keeping you on the edge of your seat—just the kind of thing you hope to find at a festival like Sundance. And Nichols once again coaxes amazing performances from his cast, particularly Matthew McConaughey, just before the actor went to work on Dallas Buyer’s Club and True Detective.—Josh Jackson 56. The Ice Storm Year: 1997 Director: Ang Lee In 1997 Ang Lee followed up his Oscar-winning Jane Austen adaptation Sense and Sensibility with yet another literary adaptation—Rick Moody’s acclaimed, if more obscure, 1994 novel, The Ice Storm. Set primarily around Thanksgiving 1973, the film explores the misadventures of a suburban Connecticut family as they attempt to cope with the alienation and confusion of the times through drugs, extramarital affairs and swinging “key parties.” Featuring phenomenal performances from Joan Allen, Kevin Kline and a teenage Christina Ricci—not to mention luminous cinematography courtesy of DP Frederick Elmes— The Ice Storm may very well stand as the greatest film Lee has ever made.—Mark Rozeman 55. The Pianist Year: 2002 Director: While many great performances rely on dramatic and affecting dialogue, Adrien Brody’s turn as real life musician Wladyslaw Szpilman in Roman Polanski’s Holocaust drama The Pianist is hushed, a sullen-eyed lost soul hanging on to a world cloaked in gray. As the title character, Brody became a living skeleton, an all-too-real representation of one of history’s darkest periods.—Justin Jacobs 54. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance No longer streaming on Netflix Year: 1962 Director: John Ford When it comes to the movies’ finest moments of cynical/wise dialogue, Chinatown’s “Forget it Jake, it’s Chinatown” may be the only equal to “This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend,” the epitaph for John Ford’s superb Western. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is about how Americans tend to romanticize the past, in the process losing a grasp on the facts, and so it’s appropriate that some viewers may have forgotten that neither of the film’s stars (James Stewart and John Wayne) actually plays Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), the feared gunman who threatens Stewart’s mild-manned lawyer. A story about living with secrets and questioning history, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance presages stellar revisionist Westerns like McCabe \u0026 Mrs. Miller and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.—Tim Grierson 53. Capote No longer streaming on Netflix as of Sept. 1, 2014 Year: 2004 Director: Bennett Miller In the same manner that In Cold Blood depicted the pristine scenes of Holcomb, Kansas, and the two men who disturbed them with a quadruple murder, Seymour Hoffman offered a precise-yet-chilling depiction of the man who helped found New Journalism. In turn, his performance burst apart Capote’s carefully crafted narrative to show just how haunted the writer himself had become.—Christina Lee 52. Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 Year: 2003, 2004 Director: Quentin Tarantino Quentin Tarantino Kill Bill Vol. 1 was both a great movie and a great martial-arts movie that paid homage to a ton of classic martial-arts flicks (both Chinese and Japanese) to make a really visceral, offbeat cinema experience unlike any other (well, at least until Vol. 2 came out). Scenes like the incredibly gory but artistic tea house battle with the Crazy 88 or the intensely claustrophobic kitchen showdown are excellent examples of everything that makes a martial-arts movie great and when combined with Tarantino’s usual hallmarks, the results are truly transcendent.—K. Alexander Smith 51. Heavenly Creatures Year: 1994 Director: Peter Jackson Before making this feverish biopic based on a notorious case in New Zealand history, Peter Jackson was best known for grisly horror comedies like Brain Dead (released in U.S. as Dead Alive). Heavenly Creatures captures the psychological landscapes of two teenage girls (Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in their big screen debuts) whose obsession with their shared imaginary world draws them further from reality. Without Jackson’s breathless narrative and ingenious fantasy scenes in Heavenly Creatures, he never would have gotten the Lord of the Rings gig, but Creatures stand on its own as a compelling thriller and commentary on moral hypocrisy. In real life, Winslet’s character grew up to be mystery writer Anne Perry.—Curt Holman 50. The Kid With a Bike Year: 2011 Directors: Jean-Pierre Dardennes, Luc Dardenne As portrait of a young boy’s resilience and of compassion shown by one human being towards another, The Kid with a Bike is part of the grand tradition of humanist realism. Watching the Dardennes’ cinema, one can’t help but be reminded of luminous predecessors like The 400 Blows and Bicycle Thieves, movies featuring marginalized children forced to endure hostile environments. But, more than any other filmmaker, their work bears the strongest resemblance to that of the late master Robert Bresson. With their powerful moral undercurrents, minimalist acting and ascetic style, Bresson’s films (Mouchette would make an excellent companion piece to The Kid with a Bike) weren’t concerned so much with stories and characters as with the ideas they helped to illuminate—namely the continual war between man’s baser and higher instincts, between the evils of mistrust and crime, and the virtues of charity, compassion and love. The Kid with a Bike is a beautifully executed variation on those themes.—Jay Antani 49. Muscle Shoals Year: 2013 Director: Greg “Freddy” Camalier Freddy Camalier’s masterly Muscle Shoals is about the beginnings and heyday of the recording scene in Muscle Shoals, Ala., a tiny town that improbably changed the face of rock ‘n’ roll, putting out along the way some of the greatest records in the history of American music. Many of those moments are recounted to great effect in the film; first-timer Camalier is obviously a natural storyteller. But there’s so much more to the doc—the cinematography is lush and beautiful, the editing is crisp and precise, and it’s in turns heartbreaking, inspiring, wry, thought-provoking, nostalgic and genuinely funny. It’s simply a stunning debut film. It helps that Camalier and his producing partner Stephen Badger are after more here than just a dry lesson in musical history. They delve into the Civil Rights Movement and its effect specifically on Alabama, especially as it relates to a Muscle Shoals music scene that was, shockingly enough, lacking in any racial tension. They return again and again to the ancient Native American legend about the river that flows through the town and the water spirit who lived there, sang songs and protected the town. And the personal life of Fame Records founder Rick Hall, the protagonist of the film, is itself worthy of a Faulkner novel. It’s thrilling, it’s engaging, it’s fascinating, it’s stirring. It’s the best documentary of the year, whether you’re a music lover or not.—Michael Dunaway 48. Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai Year: 2000 Director: Jim Jarmusch After making Dead Man, a Western film about a meek Ohio accountant and a Native American warrior, indie auteur Jim Jarmusch blended Oriental philosophy with gangster reality in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Forest Whitaker plays the title character, a hit man who adopts the code of the Hagakure, a training manual for 18th-Century would-be samurai.—Josh Jackson 47. The Good The Bad and the Ugly Year: 1966 Directed by: Sergio Leone Director Sergio Leone and star Clint Eastwood hit the ground running with their first collaboration A Fistful of Dollars, which took a Western interpretation of Akira Kurosawa’s samurai film Yojimbo. Following the adventures of Eastwood’s Man With No Name, the Dollars trilogy continued on through 1965’s For a Few Dollars More and, finally, to 1966’s The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Only the latter two are available on Netflix Instant, but The Good, The Bad and the Ugly stands just fine alone as one of the best spaghetti Westerns of all time.—Mark Rozeman 46. Jiro Dreams of Sushi Year: 2012 Director: David Gelb Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a documentary about one of the greatest masters of the culinary world, one whom casual foodies have never even heard of. Although Jiro’s work is ostensibly the focus of the documentary, the film is really propelled by the story of his relationship with his two sons; the youngest of whom has started his own restaurant, and the oldest of whom, at the age of 50, continues to work with his father, training to one day take over his restaurant. Devoid of the typical familial jealousy you may expect, Jiro Dreams of Sushi is instead a beautifully filmed documentary about a father and his sons who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of the perfect piece of sushi. —Emily Kirkpatrick 45. Cinema Paradiso Year: 1988 Director: Giuseppe Tornatore Giuseppe Tornatore’s ode to film and love provided a shot in the arm to Italy’s film industry, as well as that rarest of films—the “great subtitled date film”—for the American film-goer. It also took home the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. (The extended cut of the film reveals a more complicated take on nostalgia and the film’s father figure.)—Michael Burgin 44. Metropolis Year: 1927 Director:Fritz Lang Though in hindsight the actual story proves pretty wacky, Fritz Lang’s last silent film—before his second masterpiece M—could be called the blueprint for all sci-fi films that followed it. Whether the groundbreaking special effects, the visual scope or the intricate set design, greats such as Ridley Scott, George Lucas and Stanley Kubrick have borrowed from it (Lucas modeled C-3PO directly after the Maria robot). Metropolis, heavily influenced by the books of H.G. Wells, also stands as the first dystopian film in history.—David Roark 43. Broadcast News Year: 1987 Director: James L. Brooks One of the sharpest written, best-acted romantic comedies of the ‘80s, Broadcast News soars on the performances of Holly Hunter, William Hurt and Albert Brooks. Sure, it says things about the state of media—some of which are pretty prescient—but watching the film’s three leads inhabit their characters is a joy in and of itself.—Michael Burgin 42. Jackie Brown Year: 1997 Director: Quentin Tarantino Quentin Tarantino’s underappreciated gem Jackie Brown sees Pam Grier as the title character who shakes up the world of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster). One of the most brilliant notes in both the main actors’ performances is the stillness that each brings to his character. But if the actors are part of the orchestra, so is the music.—Michael Dunaway 41. The Untouchables Year: 1987 Director: Brian De Palma Al Capone and Eliot Ness—the quintessential gangster and the original G-Man—lock horns during Prohibition in one of the greatest American cop movies ever made. The all-star cast is great, but it’s Sean Connery as Ness’s sidekick, Jim Malone, who elevates this film from standard shoot-em-up to high drama. Director Brian DePalma juxtaposes the stylized and slick with the violent and vulgar, and the contrast serves to heighten our awareness of each. The costumes are rich, the dialogue is a pulp-writer’s dream, and the fact that Capone is brought down by the office nerd makes everyone feel great.—Joan Radell 40. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Year: 2000 Director: Ang Lee Ang Lee’s Oscar-winning epic is not only the highest-grossing foreign film ever, but also happens to be yet another foreign film that changed the cinematic landscape: a kung fu flick with heart and soul. Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi play 19th-century warriors whose loyalty and vitality are tested by a series events that lead each to contemplate their life’s decisions. Beyond the entracing and lyrical storytelling, Crouching Tiger stands as a rare, beautiful beacon of hope: a foreign film that was actually universally embraced by Western audiences. Here’s to hoping that happens more often. —Jeremy Medina 39. Man With a Movie Camera Year: 1929 Director: Dziga Vertov Some groundbreaking movies from cinema’s earliest days now seem merely quaint, their innovations fully absorbed into the DNA of modern filmmaking. Then there’s Man With a Movie Camera, which 85 years after its release still feels fresh. An experimental non-narrative directed by Dziga Vertov, a contemporary of Sergei Eisenstein (Battleship Potemkin), Man With a Movie Camera is an impressionistic portrait of urban life, giving us no characters but, rather, the sense of the complex comings and goings of everyday people through a city. One of the first examples of movies’ limitless freedom, this silent film demonstrates how we’ve always been fascinated by watching ourselves up there on the screen. Man With a Movie Camera is such a cornerstone of film history, newcomers may well be shocked how fun and playful it is.—Tim Grierson 38. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off Year: 1986 Director: John Hughes John Hughes’ zeitgeist-y, fourth wall-busting ode to rich, entitled suburban youth vs. killjoy authority announced Matthew Broderick as a bona fide star, and gave us a chillingly prescient glimpse at Charlie Sheen’s future in an admittedly funny bit role. Breakfast Club aside, out of all Hughes’ decade of teen-centric movies set in the Chicago area, Bueller has almost certainly endured the best, and without all that tortured pretentiousness.—Scott Wold 37. The General Director: Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckham Year: 1926 Plot: When Yankee spies steal his locomotive and kidnap his girlfriend, a Southern railroad engineer (“The Great Stone Face” Buster Keaton) is forced to pursue his two beloveds across enemy lines. Why it matters: While a few Charlie Chaplin pictures give it a run for its money, The General is arguably the finest silent comedy ever made—if not the finest comedy ever made. At the pinnacle of Buster Keaton’s renowned career, the film didn’t receive critical or box-office success when released, but it has aged tremendously. It’s a spectacle of story, mishmashing romance, adventure, action (chases, fires, explosions) and comedy into a seamless silent masterpiece.—David Roark 36. Waking Ned Devine Year: 1998 Director: Kirk Jones Waking Ned Devine may be the most feel-good heist flick ever made. Ned is an old-timer in a small Irish village who wins the lottery and dies from the shock of it. Two of his old-timer buddies, Jackie (Ian Bannen) and Michael (Fawlty Towers’ David Kelly), decide to scam the big-city lotto agent into thinking that one of them is Ned, alive and well. What ensues is not so much a con-artist caper but more an Irish celebration of community, camaraderie and the spirit of human generosity. Other Irish themes championed: whiskey, lush landscapes, poetry, naked old dudes riding motorcycles, whiskey and the fiddle. Did we mention whiskey?—Ryan Carey 35. 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days Year: 2007 Director: Christian Mungui With eerily realistic performances and stunning direction, 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days combines an uncomfortably forthright discussion of abortion with long, virtuosic handheld camera takes. In Cristian Mungui’s hand, these shots are more than just a gimmick; they position the audience behind the camera and refuse to let us look away from the horrors on screen. At times, it’s difficult to watch, but few films have ever displayed as perfect a marriage of form and content.—Sean Gandert 34. Planes, Trains and Automobiles Year: 1987 Director: John Hughes Anyone who’s ever endured holiday traffic on their way home for Thanksgiving can relate to this John Hughes tale—although hopefully you’ve never had to endure the sheer number of transportation mishaps (not to mention some accidental spooning) Steve Martin and John Candy go through.—Bonnie Stiernberg 33. Double Indemnity Year: 1944 Director: Billy Wilder Long before the Boomers came to know Fred MacMurray as the kindly father on My Three Sons, the actor essayed his best performance in Double Indemnity as the deplorable, hard-boiled Walter Neff, who falls for a married temptress (Barbara Stanwyck) who talks him into killing her husband. Whether in film or on television, MacMurray normally played the nice guy, but for Double Indemnity he turned his everyman decency into a mask—perfect for a character who can barely conceal what a lustful, conniving bastard he is. One of the great noirs, this early effort from Billy Wilder revealed the filmmaker’s talent for wonderfully thorny, unapologetically rotten characters—and it doubles as one of the definitive mid-century Los Angeles movies.—Tim Grierson 32. Days of Heaven Year: 1978 Director: Terrence Malick Terrence Malick recreated the biblical story of Abraham and Sarah as an American myth as large as the southwest it’s supposed to take place in. One of the most immediately noticeable aspects of the film is its stunning cinematography. Following the tradition of the French New Wave and other independent American pictures from the ‘70s, director of photography Nestor Almendros rejected artificial lighting as much as he felt he could and the result is a picture that feels like nothing else from the period. With Badlands Malick found out how to make a film, but it was with Days of Heaven that he found his mature style, and since then he’s used the same elliptical, minimalist storytelling and improvised scenes in everything he’s done.—Sean Gandert 31. Rocky Year: 1976 Director: John G. Avildsen Rocky may be the one of the most inspirational films of all time. The movie poses the question: What happens when a small-time boxer from Philadelphia gets a one-in-a-million shot at the World Heavyweight Championship? All Rocky Balboa wanted to do was prove that he wasn’t a bum and that he could go the distance with Apollo Creed. With a budget under 1 million dollars, Rocky would go on to win an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1976 and spawn the ultimate sports movie series. Talk about an awesome soundtrack.—Gregory Eckert 30. The Apartment No longer streaming on Netflix as of Sept. 1, 2014 Year: 1960 Director: Billy Wilder Filmmaker Billy Wilder had perhaps one of the greatest, most diverse track records in film history from 1944 to 1960. In this period, he tackled an Oscar-winning drama about alcoholism (The Lost Weekend), two well-regarded film noirs (Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard), a war drama (Stalag 17), two light-hearted rom-coms (Sabrina, Seven Year Itch) a gripping murder-mystery (Witness for the Prosecution) and perhaps the funniest American movie of all time (Some Like It Hot). Yet, of all these golden credits, one Wilder’s most beloved and memorable achievements was 1960’s The Apartment. Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an ambitious office worker who, desperate to climb the corporate ladder, allows his bosses to use his apartment to carry on discreet affairs with their mistresses. Things get complicated, however, when he discovers that his office crush, quirky elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), is one of his bosses’ mistresses. While it actually gets quite dark at times, The Apartment strikes a perfect balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and emotionally honest drama. Following the career highlight that was his drag-heavy performance in Some Like It Hot, Lemmon here proves that he can play the low-key, straight man with equal dexterity. Likewise, MacLaine’s charming portrayal as the damaged, yet lovable Kubelik would provide the model for manic pixie dream girls for years to come.—Mark Rozeman 29. The Conversation Year: 1974 Director: Francis Ford Coppola The really incredible fact about this film is that Coppola made it as a side project between Godfather movies (which I’ve left off purposefully despite their greatness). Starring Gene Hackman, it’s the story of a surveillance technician coming face to face with the implications of his job, and the paranoia of being watched at every moment. It was nominated for Best Picture in 1974, an award that went to The Godfather, Part II. It’s one of the rare times in film history when a director has lost to himself.—Shane Ryan 28. Trainspotting Year: 1996 Director: Danny Boyle Based on the gritty Irvine Welsh novel of the same name, this early film from the director of Slumdog Millionaire and Millions follows a thuggish group of heroin addicts in Scotland and features brilliant performances from young Ewan McGregor, Kelly Macdonald and Robert Carlyle. At times funny, gripping and nightmarishly haunting, Trainspotting is not an easy movie to forget.—Josh Jackson 27. Rosemary’s Baby Year: 1968 Director: Roman Polanski The most famous of Polanski’s paranoid thrillers, not to mention the most inviolable. The film infiltrates a privileged space of middle-class entitlement and pollutes it with the most extreme evil possible: sweet, unassuming Rosemary (Mia Farrow) is pregnant, but could her baby already belong to someone else? The volatile climax has an answer, and the sequence has remained one of the most celebrated in horror history for good reason.—Sean Edgar 26. The Avengers Year: 2012 Director: Joss Whedon While Joss Whedon smartly recognizes how key Robert Downey Jr.’s Stark is to the story, he also allows most all of his cast, heroes and villain, ample opportunities to shine, both in dialogue and action. (Hawkeye and Nick Fury, not so much.) It can’t be overstated how crucial such balance is to a team film. As Loki, Hiddleston may be the best-cast arch-villain since Ian McKellen’s Magneto. (This bodes well for the “shared universe” Marvel Studios is building. Just as in its comic books, Marvel needs its villains to emit suitable levels of dastardliness. Let’s just hope there are enough British stage and screen actors to supply its needs.) The rest of the principals—particularly Hemsworth, Evans and Ruffalo—inhabit their characters so seamlessly, the viewer can just move straight to the wonder and fun of it all.—Michael Burgin 25. The Station Agent Year: 2003 Director: Thomas McCarthy One of the early breakout roles for Game of Thrones’ Peter Dinklage was this warm, funny story of a reclusive man who moves into an abandoned train depot. Director Thomas McCarthy has made a career of caring deeply for his characters in films like The Visitor and Win Win, and here it’s to slowly convince Dinklage’s Finbar McBride that his low view of humanity might just be wrong. It’s a contemplative, tender, hilarious film that feels both real and uplifting. If only George R.R. Martin would give Tyrion this kind of break.—Josh Jackson 24. Hotel Rwanda No longer streaming on Netflix Year: 2004 Director: Terry George While Hotel Rwanda attempts to document the country’s genocide in 1994, it does so by focusing on the character of Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), who gave refuge to hundreds of fleeing Tutsis. Calling in dozens of favors with his extensive network of contacts, he was able to hold the Hutu extremists (the Interahamwe militia) at bay, until the Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu from power. Cheadle portrays Rusesabagina as an efficient manager who cares deeply about his family and the people in he looks after. It’s a gripping film that bears witness to both a historic tragedy and one man’s bravery. “I never thought I was doing something different,” Rusesabagina modestly told Paste just after the film’s release. “I thought I was just acting as a normal hotel manager.”—J. Robert Parks 23. Airplane! Year: 1980 Director: Jim Abrahams The writing trio of Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker (ZAZ) defined a genre with their disaster-movie spoof in 1980. The jokes fly fast and furious, from the “Who’s on First” confusion of a crew that includes Roger and Captain Oveur (“Roger, Roger. What’s our vector, Victor?”) to Oveur (Peter Graves) asking a kid in the cockpit, “Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?” to an old lady translating jive (“Jive-ass dude don’t got no brains anyhow! Shiiiiit!”) to “stop calling me Shirley!” Ridiculous and ridiculously quotable, it’s the funniest spoof film of all time.—Josh Jackson 22. Donnie Darko Year: 2001 Director: Richard Kelly Richard Kelly was just 25 when he got funding for his first full-length feature, Donnie Darko, but it became a cult classic, thanks to mind-bending twists and a gigantic talking bunny named “Frank.” Trippy, clever, dark and fun, it’s worth revisiting every few years. Just don’t ever doubt our commitment to Sparkle Motion.—Josh Jackson 21. Man on Wire Year: 2008 Director: James Marsh In 1974, high-wire walker Philippe Petit fulfilled a longstanding dream by sneaking into New York’s World Trade Center, stringing a cable between the tops of the two towers, and—with almost unfathomable guts—walking across it without a net. The man is clearly a nut, but he’s also a great storyteller with a heck of a story, and Man on Wire gives him a chance to tell it. Petit’s stunt was both an engineering challenge and a test of, well, a test of something that most of us don’t possess in this much quantity. Filmmaker James Marsh uses standard documentary techniques, combining new interviews with a satisfying pile of footage and photographs, but his film has the suspense of a caper movie. The title comes from the report written by a police officer who was more than a little uncertain about how to respond to the audacity on display.—Robert Davis 20. The City of Lost Children Year: 1998 Directors: Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Marc Caro Ron Perlman plays the reluctant hero as a circus strongman looking for his adopted little brother. Marc Caro (Delicatessen) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie) team up to create a wildly imaginative dystopian universe. A mad scientist is harvesting children’s dreams in order to keep himself young. Perlman’s character One enlists the help of an orphaned street-thief named Miette. Fans of Terry Gilliam and Michel Gondry will appreciate this surreal masterpiece.—Josh Jackson 19. Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Year: 1998 Director: Guy Ritchie The debut film from Guy Ritchie, this super stylistic take on the gangster formula pays homage to the work of Quentin Tarantino. From the sardonic humor, to slapstick violence, to the twisty plot, you could call it the British Reservoir Dogs on crack. Its obtrusive soundtrack—a mix of classic rock, reggae and pop—brings it all together.—David Roark 18. Memento Year: 2000 Director: Christopher Nolan During a brutal attack in which he believes his wife was raped and murdered, insurance-fraud investigator Leonard Shelby (played with unequivocal intensity, frustration and panic by Guy Pearce) suffers head trauma so severe it leads to his inability to retain new memories for more than a few minutes. This device allows Nolan to brilliantly deconstruct traditional cinematic storytelling, toggling between chronological black-and-white vignettes and full-color five-minute segments that unfold in reverse order while Pearce frantically searches for his wife’s killer. The film is jarring, inventive and adventurous, and the payoff is every bit worth the mind-bending descent into madness.—Steve LaBate 17. Terminator 2: Judgement Day Year: 1991 Director: James Cameron That rare sequel that trumps its predecessor, James Cameron and co-writer William Wisher Jr. crafted a near-perfect action-movie script that flipped the original on its head and let Ahnold be a good guy. But it’s Linda Hamilton’s transformation from damsel-in-distress to bad-ass hero that makes the film so notable. Why should the guys get all the good action scenes? This may not be the best film on this list, but it’s the best sci-fi movie. It hits the target it’s aiming for squarely in the bullseye.—Michael Burgin 16. Amélie Year: 2001 Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet A delicate, delicious little French trifle, Amélie is easily one of the most romantic films on Netflix. The adorable Audrey Tautou launched herself into the American consciousness as the quirky do-gooder waitress who sends her secret crush photos and riddles masking her identity in order to make their first encounter—and first kiss—the most romantic moment of her life. Endlessly imaginative and beautifully photographed, Amélie is a film to be treasured.—Jeremy Medina 15. The Thin Blue Line Year: 1988 Director: Errol Morris Errol Morris’ first mature feature is perhaps the most famous case of a documentary having a life outside the silver screen. The Thin Blue Line focuses on the case of Randall Adams, who allegedly murdered a police officer. Combining his nearly obsessive concern for the truth with his experience as a private detective, Morris unearthed a plethora of misconceptions and flat-out lies that made it clear Adams was being framed. Publicity surrounding the film resulted in his case being re-opened, exonerating Adams.—Sean Gandert 14. Reservoir Dogs Year: 1992 Director: Quentin Tarantino Reservoir Dogs’ debut at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival launched not only the career of one Quentin Tarantino but an American indie genre unto itself characterized by extreme violence, profane dialogue, nonlinear storytelling and a curated soundtrack. Many have tried, but none of his imitators has achieved the visual and aural poetry at work in Tarantino’s oeuvre, particularly his magnum opus Pulp Fiction, upon whose release in 1994 newly minted fans went back to discover the aftermath of Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink and Mr. White’s botched diamond heist (but not the heist itself). This is where it all began.—Annlee Ellingson 13. The Graduate Year: 1967 Director: Mike Nichols In the undisputed king of movies for those headed out into the real world, a hyper-accomplished recent grad (Dustin Hoffman) panics at the prospect of his future and falls into an affair with the much older wife of his father’s business partner (Anne Bancroft). It helped define a generation long since embalmed by history, but the sense of longing for an alternative hasn’t aged.—Jeffrey Bloomer 12. Taxi Driver No longer streaming on Netflix Year: 1976 Director: Martin Scorsese Taxi Driver was Scorsese’s breakthrough: a seething condemnation of alienation—not to mention New York’s descent in the 1970s into a crime-ridden hellscape—delivered with such clinical coldness that when Scorsese’s star (and longtime collaborator) Robert De Niro finally explodes, it’s unspeakably upsetting. If Taxi Driver now feels slightly overrated, it’s only because the movie’s DNA has crept into so many subsequent filmmakers’ efforts. Scorsese grew up loving Westerns, and Taxi Driver could be his version of The Searchers—except his man-out-of-time finds no redemption.—Tim Grierson 11. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Year: 1969 Director: George Roy Hill Paired with Robert Redford, Paul Newman tore into his part as the folk outlaw Butch Cassidy and created an instant touchstone of the genre. That Newman lent his star to a film with criminal heroes was a revolutionary act for an actor of his stature at the time, and for that it’ll likely remain his best-remembered role.—Jeffrey Bloomer 10. Dr. Strangelove No longer streaming on Netflix Year: 1964 Director: Stanley Kubrick While attempting to adapt Peter George’s novel Red Alert for the big screen, director Stanley Kubrick found that he kept needing to cut out certain real-life details about the emergency nuclear bomb procedures because they were simply too absurd to work in a serious drama. Deciding to rewrite the project as a dark comedy, he recruited renowned satirist Terry Southern to help pen the script. From there, it’s all history. To this day, Peter Sellers’ three very different (and very funny) performances remain a feat by which few actors have matched. Moreover, the image of Slim Pickens riding the bomb to its destination as well as the final montage of destruction set to the wistful “We’ll Meet Again” are the stuff of movie legend. Worldwide Armageddon has never been so hilarious.—Mark Rozeman 9. The Apostle Year: 1997 Director: Robert Duvall Insightful and real portraits of men of faith seem to elude filmmakers—it seems every preacher, especially, that appears on the silver screen is either a saint or a demon. There’s a whole lot of both—and then some—in Duvall’s Sonny Dewey. He’s simultaneously vain and humble, patient and hot-tempered, chaste and decadent. He’s a jumble of mixed motivations, as are we all. And he knows it. No wonder Robert Duvall refused to let anyone else take control of his beautiful script, and waited until he had the means to produce the film himself, with complete creative control. Only a man with so much passion for this project could have kept it safe from harm and brought such a masterpiece to the screen.—Michael Dunaway 8. Hoop Dreams Year: 1994 Director: Steve James Seldom has a film, narrative or documentary, so probingly explored the American Dream. In this case, the version of the dream that young William Gates and Arthur Agee have bought into is redemption (and fortune and fame) through athletic achievement. That the odds are stacked so heavily against those dreams ever coming true only makes their dearest hopes that much more poignant. Steve James famously spent nearly eight years making the film, and despite its nearly three-hour running time, it doesn’t feel long at all. Every frame feels essential.—Michael Dunaway 7. Pulp Fiction Year: 1994 Director: Quentin Tarantino Still Quentin Tarantino’s greatest accomplishment, Pulp Fiction rehashes a handful of other great gangster movies to form a modern masterpiece. In a full-circle plot of crossings and complications, the smart elick of a movie takes us on an ultra-violent and ultra-funny ride with John Travolta at his best and Samuel L. Jackson dropping F-bombs like no one else.—David Roark 6. Chinatown Year: 1974 Director: Roman Polanski With one of the greatest opening scenes in cinema, Polanski’s look at 1930s Los Angeles provides yet another opportunity for Jack Nicholson to shine and for noir to captivate an audience with an iconic private eye (Nicholson’s J.J. Gittes) and femme fetale (Faye Dunaway).—Josh Jackson 5. Apocalypse Now Year: 1979 Director: Francis Ford Coppola Francis Ford Coppola’s best film without the word “Godfather” in it was the result of two years in the jungle, which led to performances that captured mental breakdown in a way that felt all too real. The update to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness was a different kind of war movie, one which captured the horror of war and the madness of Vietnam like no other before or since. See the original film or the 2001 edit with additional footage, Apocalypse Now Redux, both available on Netflix Instant.—Josh Jackson 4. Manhattan Year: 1979 Director: Woody Allen Gorgeously shot in black-and-white and set against a backdrop of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” Allen’s ode to the city that never sleeps is a profound meditation on love and loss. Allen, Diane Keaton and Michael Murphy play jaded, self-absorbed adults who over-think and over-analyze every aspect of life. Mariel Hemingway beautifully plays Tracy, the young girl in love with Allen and the only character who is honest about her feelings, the only one with the capacity to love whole-heartedly. The other characters are too delicate, too bruised, and too cynical. When Tracy tells him “you have to have a little faith in people” in the film’s touching final scene, our hearts melt a little—love may be fragile and fleeting, but it’s worth the risk every time. Romantic, witty and bittersweet, Manhattan is impeccably crafted, and stands tallest among Allen’s multitude of towering achievements.—Jeremy Medina 3. Fargo Year: 1996 Directors: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen In exploring the unsavory implications of “Minnesota nice,” the Coen Brothers created one of the most beloved, acclaimed and quotable films of all time. “Fargo” explores the tension that accompanies polite social norms and the quiet desperations they often mask, and many scenes are awkward enough to make your skin crawl. The emotional restraint displayed by Jerry Lundegaard and Mike is a thin and disingenuous veil over yearnings for money or companionship. The foil to this, obviously, is Marge Gunderson, who just really is that nice and hardworking and downright normal. Because of her and her husband’s gentleness, the movie makes you appreciate the art behind postage stamps as much as it makes you cringe at the sound of a wood chipper.—Allie Conti 2. The Bicycle Thief (Ladri di biciclette) Year: 1948 Director: Vittorio De Sica This tale of a father and son in poverty-stricken Italy is on of the most moving films I’ve ever seen. Part of the neo-realism movement, it was shot on the streets of Rome and was quickly recognized as a masterpiece by film critics around the world. There’s simply no better way to spend 89 minutes in front of screen.—Josh Jackson 1. Raging Bull Year: 1980 Director: Martin Scorsese The best film of the 1980s contains one of the all-time-great feats of directing and one of the all-time-great feats of screen acting. The status that Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull has achieved in the years since its release is completely earned. Watching it is a fully felt experience. Over the years, much has been made of the weight Robert De Niro gained while filming Raging Bull to authentically capture the physical transformation of boxer Jake LaMotta. While it’s a great symbol of his commitment, the pounds don’t begin to explain the depths of the character portrait he and Martin Scorsese created. The film looks unforgivingly at a fragile, insecure man who communicates his need for love with jealousy, anger and violence. Scorsese’s shots convey the overly suspicious workings of LaMotta’s head, then back out to coldly observe the horrific violence that ensues. Then there are the boxing scenes. Scorsese deserves endless praise for finding such lively, inventive ways to capture the experience inside the ring. But what’s really amazing is that he goes beyond a great sports scene. Each fight serves as a window into LaMotta’s soul. The camera movement, the quick edits, the sudden shifts in speed all reflect his mental state, his need to damage himself or cause damage to others. Such expressive, visceral filmmaking has rarely been equaled.—Michael Burgin",
    "LabBody": "We’ve been publishing our guides to the best movies and TV shows on Netflix for three years now, and the selections keep improving. More than half of the movies in our 2014 edition are new from last year, and they pull from a variety of styles—romantic comedies, action flicks, indie dramas, blockbuster sci-fi, documentaries, animated films and more. And if you already know what kind of movie you’re in the mood for, check out our genre-specific guides, as well: 101. Forrest Gump. Year: 1994 Director: Robert Zemeckis Few films infiltrate the collective American psyche quite the way Forrest Gump managed. You’ve undoubtedly heard someone make reference to this 1994 classic—whether it was a classmate sarcastically yelling “Run, Forrest, run!” as you hustled to catch the bus, or someone busting out their best drawl to deliver, “Momma always said life is like a box of chocolates.” The entire film is full of dialogue that’s both moving and funny (my personal favorites include “But Lt. Dan, you ain’t got no legs” and “I’m sorry I had a fight at your Black Panther party”). Forrest may be a simple man, but his story is our nation’s story, and we all are run through the emotional gauntlet as we watch him hang with Elvis and John Lennon, fight in Vietnam and encounter many a civic protest—all while in pursuit of his true love, Jenny. Tom Hanks delivers an Oscar-winning performance, and Gary Sinise is heartbreaking as Lt. Dan.—Bonnie Stiernberg. Year: 2013 Director: Jason Osder On May 13, 1985, a deadly altercation broke out in Philadelphia between police and a radical organization called MOVE, resulting in 11 deaths and the destruction of several city blocks. First-time filmmaker Jason Osder’s riveting documentary brilliantly re-creates that day entirely through live local broadcasts and a televised city hearing months later that investigated who was at fault. Let the Fire Burn is a found-footage landmark that presents a troubling commentary on race relations in America that remain distressingly unresolved. Perhaps even more impressively, though, Osder’s film doubles as a moving, engrossing courtroom thriller populated with unexpected heroes and fascinating, nuanced insights into how human beings behave in a crisis.—Tim Grierson. No longer streaming on Netflix Year: 1987 Director: Mel Brooks Originally perceived as one of writer/director Mel Brooks’ lesser works, this loving send-up of the sci-fi/fantasy genre (specifically, Star Wars) has, over the years, wormed its way into the hearts of a new generation of fans who caught it on video. “May the Schwartz be with you,” “Ludicrous Speed,” “Mawg”—if these are all terms that mean nothing to you then it’s high-time you checked this movie out and see what all the fuss is about.—Mark Rozeman. Year: 2012 Director: Colin Trevorrow At the last few Sundance Film Festivals, a running joke has developed about the ubiquity of Mark Duplass. It seems like if he’s not writing and directing an independent film with his brother Jay (Cyrus, Jeff, Who Lives at Home), he’s producing and/or starring in another. But while indie film fans may feel like they’ve gotten a handle on Duplass’s hipster vibe, his performance in Safety Not Guaranteed shows that he can be mysterious as well as funny, brooding as well as charming.—Jeremy Matthews. No longer streaming on Netflix as of Sept. 1, 2014 Year: 1991 Director: Terry Gilliam Many of Robin Williams’ characters dangle perilously close to the edge of sanity, but Parry has been pushed right off that cliff in The Fisher King. Terry Gilliam’s Arthurian tale is set in the present, but it still takes a fantastical journey for Jeff Bridges’ disgraced talk-show host and Williams’ homeless widower to find The Holy Grail, sweet Lydia and redemption.—Josh Jackson. 96. M*A*S*H. Year: 1970 Director: Robert Altman Considering that it became the basis of a beloved (and long-running) CBS sitcom, it’s easy to forget how revolutionary the original M*A*S*H film was at the time of its release. Certainly, more than 40 years after it first scandalized moviegoers, this 1970 black comedy about the exploits of a Korean War-era surgical hospital not only stands as one of the most subversive portraits of war ever put to film but also as one of the flat-out, most hilarious movies ever made. Boasting a script consisting almost entirely of improv, a major comedic set piece centered on a suicide attempt and the first utterance of the word “fuck” in a mainstream film, M*A*S*H redefined the American comedy and promptly secured director Robert Altman’s status as the ultimate actor’s director.—Mark Rozeman. Year: 2003 Director: Gore Verbinski Daring to base the central character of a Disney franchise on a notorious junkie-alcoholic walking-corpse rock star like Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards was a coup, but even more mind-blowing was how well Depp’s crazy idea worked. Guzzling rum as he bobs and weaves—stumbles, really—through this film delivering hilariously slurred one-liners, he is the consummate goodhearted scoundrel, easily stealing every frame he flamboyantly swaggers across.—Steve LaBate. Year: 1997 Director: Luc Besson The Fifth Element is the ultimate display of what would happen if someone with the sci-fi enthusiasm of a teenage boy wrote a big-budget Hollywood script, which is exactly the case here. Set in 23rd century New York City, taxi driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) gets wrapped up in saving the world with his passenger Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), the fifth and final piece that is needed to protect earth. Entertaining, thrilling, and visually fantastical, The Fifth Element is worth every minute of your time.—Caitlin Colford. Year: 2008 Director: Tomas Alfredson Vampire stories are plastered all over American pop culture these days (True Blood, Twilight, The Vampire Diaries), but leave it to the Swedes to produce a vampire film that manages to be both sweet and frightening. The friendship between Oskar, a scrawny, 12-year-old outcast, and Eli, a centuries-old vampire frozen in the body of a child, is a chilling but beautiful story to behold.—Jeremy Medina. 92. Charade. Year: 1963 Director: Stanley Donen Cary Grant is the most charming male lead ever. Audrey Hepburn is the most charming female lead ever. Everything else is just bonus in this romantic thriller about a woman pursued in Paris for her late husband’s stolen fortune: the Henry Mancini score, the Hitchcock-ian suspense, the plot twists and Walter Mathau as a CIA agent.—Michael Dunaway. Year: 2005 Director: Fernando Meirelles In The Constant Gardener, diplomacy is overstepped by both those with corrupt intentions and those who see it as a bureaucratic divide to human charity. Combining the oft-convoluted storytelling of novelist John Le Carré and the violently dazzling visuals of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (City of God), its message is emboldened by the failure of its well-intentioned characters to intervene in the robbed lives of others.—Cameron Bird. 90. The Trip. Year: 2011 Director: Michael Winterbottom Two British actor/comedians playing versions of themselves travel the beautiful and bleak north England countryside, stopping to eat at various upscale restaurants, but mostly just talking. And talking and talking. And doing impressions of Michael Caine, Woody Allen, and Liam Neeson, as well as British personalities an American audience might not recognize. But mostly just talking, with overlapping affection and competition. Sound like a good idea for a film? It absolutely is.—Jonah Flicker. Year: 1990 Director: Wong Kar Wai It’s a crying shame that In the Mood for Love isn’t also available on Netflix, because it would certainly rank near the top of this list. But this film, described as an “informal prequel” is worthy enough on its own as well. It’s also got Maggie Chen and Tony Leung, but the star turn here is from Leslie Cheung as Yuddy, the Lothario leaving a trail of broken hearts in his wake. The tone is certainly more on the bitter end of bittersweet, but Wong Kar-wai’s directorial voice, of a man who believes in love, shines through loud and strong.—Michael Dunaway. Year: 1996 Director: Anthony Minghella It wasn’t just Elaine Benes who thought that The English Patient was overrated and boring: Even at the time of its Oscar win, this period romantic epic was being criticized in some quarters for its self-consciously old-school sweep. To which its fans say, “Yeah, so?” A stellar “They don’t make ’em like this anymore” movie, filmmaker Anthony Minghella’s adaptation of Michael Ondaatje’s novel starred Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas as the most poignantly star-crossed big-screen lovers since Ilsa walked backed into Rick’s life. Beautifully shot, sensitively acted, romantically overpowering, The English Patient is way, way better than Sack Lunch.—Tim Grierson. Director: Destin Cretton As it progresses, Short Term 12 remains rigorously structured in terms of plot; yet it never feels calculated. In fact, the film serves as a fine example of how invisible screenwriting can be. By allowing his characters’ irrational emotions to influence events and instigate key turning points, Cretton capably masks the film’s finely calibrated story mechanics. And while everything seemingly comes to a head during a key crisis, it’s only fitting that the story ends with a denouement that bookends its opening. Cretton’s clear-eyed film is far too honest to try and convince us that there’s been any sort of profound change for Grace or anyone else. Instead, it’s content to serve as a potent reminder that tentative first steps can be every bit as narratively compelling as great leaps of faith.—Curtis Woloschuk. Year: 1991 Director: Joel Coen While hung up with the intricate plotting of Miller’s Crossing, The Coen Brothers took a break to write a script about a blocked screenwriter (Jon Turturro). Reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch at their most darkly satiric, Barton Fink depicts a self-important New York playwright who struggles to write a Hollywood wrestling picture while residing in a rotting hotel. A jaundiced metaphor for the compromised creative process of show business, Barton Fink delivers the deadpan comedy and quirky performances of the Coens’ trademark, including Oscar nominee Michael Lerner as a bombastic studio chief, John Mahoney as a boozing, Faulkner-esque novelist, and John Goodman as a cheerful salesman with a dark secret. Audiences can obsess over the meaning of lines like Goodman’s “I’ll show you the life of the mind!” but any answers the film holds are unlikely to be reassuring.—Curt Holman. Year: 1989 Director: Cameron Crowe In his directorial debut, Cameron Crowe places one of the all-time charming film courtships within that strangely insular time, mid-transition, between high school and college (or career or family). In Lloyd Dobler, the defining role of John Cusack’s career, Crowe presents an appealing, convincing everyman whose pursuit of a girl (Ione Skye), supposedly out of his league, reveals how foolish such handicapping can be in the first place. Though Crowe would go on to create a number of career-launching roles for women (Renee Zellweger and Kate Hudson should thank him, daily), in Say Anything, Dobler rules.—Michael Burgin. Year: 2011 Director: Drew Goddard For a movie chock-full of twists, perhaps the biggest is that despite all appearances to the contrary, The Cabin in the Woods is a heartfelt love story. Mind you, not between any of the young and pretty college students who tempt fate at the cabin in question. No, this romance is between creators Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, and the scary-movie genre as a whole. A ménage à terror, if you will. Like Scream before it, the film is a simultaneous dissection and celebration of all the tropes to which it pays homage, while also managing to be a superb example of the genre in its own right. The script is vintage Whedon—smart, funny and surprising. Thanks to Goddard’s direction and staging, and despite the film’s very focus on the formulaic nature of horror, it still manages to be tense, atmospheric and jump-out-of-your-seat scary. The Cabin in the Woods may very well be the ultimate schlocky little horror movie.—Dan Kaufman. Year: 2007 Director: Julian Schnabel In 1995, French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby suffered a horrific stroke that left his entire body paralyzed in what doctors call the “locked-in syndrome.” In a remarkable testament to the human spirit, Bauby was able to dictate a 132-page memoir by blinking his left eye. Incredibly, ace-auteur Julian Schnabel adapted that memoir into a breathtaking, lyrical, haunting film that is as much his creation as Bauby’s. (Kudos to the Academy for recognizing Schnabel’s brilliance with a Best Director nomination.) The Diving Bell is not only a testament to the human spirit, but to the power of cinema as well.—Jeremy Medina. Year: 1992 Director: James Foley Surely somewhere on the Internet there’s a catalog of all the potboiler plays that have been turned into lifeless movies; wherein the minimal settings came off as flat rather than intimate or claustrophobic, and the surgically written prose came off as stilted rather than impassioned. Glengarry Glen Ross is the exception and the justification for all noble stage-to-screen attempts since. This adaptation of David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize winning play about workingman’s inhumanity to workingman still crackles today, and its best lines (and there are many) have become ingrained in the angrier sections of our collective zeitgeist. James Foley directs the playwright’s signature cadence better than the man himself, and the all-star cast give performances they’ve each only hoped to match since. Mamet, for his part, managed to elevate his already stellar material with his screenplay, adding the film’s most iconic scene, the oft-quoted Blake speech brilliantly delivered by Alec Baldwin. This is a film worthy of a cup of coffee and, as we know, coffee is for closers only.—Bennett Webber. Year: 1999 Director: Anthony Minghella Many doubted anyone could do justice to the Ripley novels on celluloid, but Anthony Minghella proved them wrong in spectacular fashion. Lushly photographed, exquisitely art-directed and impeccably timed (not a scene is a moment too long or too short), it intrigues and bewilders like Hitchcock’s best work. Career performances from Matt Damon and Jude Law, plus wonderful turns from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett—and the last time Gwenyth Paltrow was bearable. A frightful—and frightfully overlooked—film.—Michael Dunaway.",

OREGON — A statue of a young black boy wearing a butler-like uniform and carrying a lantern is stirring controversy in this Ogle County community. But as the nation grapples again with racism in the wake of the killing of nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, it doesn't appear that the symbol that some consider racist will be removed from Jim Barnes' lawn any time soon. “I’m offended personally and embarrassed as the mayor of the city,\" Mayor Ken Williams said, not mincing words when asked his thoughts on the statue. Similar statues have sat on many U.S. lawns through the years. But Williams wants this one taken down. “I’m embarrassed we have it in our city,” he said. “I don’t see any place for it.” Williams is also concerned about how the symbol will affect his business. He owns the Pinehill Inn Bed \u0026 Breakfast, which is just a few doors down from Barnes’ house. Williams worries that some of his guests may find the statue offensive and go elsewhere for lodging. Despite his objections, Williams has never asked Barnes to remove the statue. Williams consulted an attorney, who advised that the mayor has no jurisdiction on Barnes’ private property. Barnes, the city's commissioner of public property, was mayor from 1975 through 1999. He said nobody has spoken to him directly about the statue, although he did receive an anonymous letter about 20 years ago asking him to “paint the statue’s face white\" so it would not offend blacks. Barnes said he ignores anonymous notes. Cute, not cute Besides, as Barnes tells it, he probably wouldn’t remove it anyway: “It might be offensive to them, but not to me and not to most people.” He bought the statue nearly 30 years ago at a store in Chicago. “I just thought it was cute.” “We need to understand what this is, it’s not a cute image,” said LaVerne Gyant, director for the Center for Black Studies at Northern Illinois University. “It is perpetuating an image or stereotype of African-Americans.” Barnes hasn’t researched the lawn ornament’s history. However, a magazine salesman tried to explain the significance of the statue one afternoon many years ago, but Barnes wasn’t interested. “To my thinking, it does not represent slavery,” Barnes said.

However, a magazine salesman tried to explain the significance of the statue one afternoon many years ago, but Barnes wasn’t interested. “To my thinking, it does not represent slavery,” Barnes said. Gyant said that’s not exactly correct. Through the years, the statue morphed from a young man in tattered clothing to one in a house servant’s attire with a horse jockey’s cap. Barnes’ statue features the latter. The statue also was used during the Civil War to indicate whether a house was a safe or dangerous stop on the Underground Railroad. A red ribbon was a warning, a green ribbon represented safety. Teaching tool. No matter what clothing or ribbon is featured on the statue, Gyant says, the young man was a slave: “All of them were enslaved. They were not free young boys, which means they were working for somebody white.” Gyant, who is black, said the statue would be OK to display in Barnes' yard if he used it as an educational tool. She said African-American organizations encourage black residents to “buy up” the statues and similar items in order to educate others on its historical significance. “Conversation can be held about these images so that people can understand. I use similar items in my teachings to explain some of the stereotypes, but some white people don’t want to understand the significance behind them.” Gyant said conversation is important in communities like Oregon, where the black community is small — less than 1 percent of the population of around 3,700 — and may not be as active as in larger communities with more significant African-American populations. Barnes and Williams are white. The statue’s image may be heightened because of the debate over the Confederate flag, which came to a head after the church shooting in Charleston. The gunman, Dylann Storm, posed in photographs with the flag before the attack. Gyant cautions against comparing the “Faithful Groomsman” with the Confederate flag. “The Confederate flag is an open symbol of white supremacy,” she said firmly. Barnes said the flag is different as well, but he stands by his right to display those items on his property. A city rep. Williams said Barnes is missing the point: Barnes has a right to express his feelings, but as a commissioner of the city, he must be held to a higher standard. “Some things are just personally offensive,” Williams said. “As a commissioner, you now have a responsibility to represent and be a role model for all residents.” Barnes disagrees. “I’ve always felt that as a political figure I had to be above reproach. But I don’t see this as being negative to anybody. I think someone is just nitpicking on one item.” Barnes says he will listen to any concerns people may have. “I’ll listen to you, but I may not agree with you,” he said. “Come talk to me face to face.” Maggie Hradecky: 815-987-1367; mhradecky@rrstar.com; @maggiehrad.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The 2015 Wimbledon ladies' final will be contested between the very familiar Serena Williams and a 21 year old named Garbiñe Muguruza; if you don't follow tennis during its 11-month slog of a season, you probably have no idea who the latter is. Muguruza has only played two matches at the US Open, and she's lost both of them. Prior to this run at Wimbledon, her record on the hallowed grass courts was an unimpressive 2-3. And if you pay attention to the three big U.S. tournaments – Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati – well, you probably missed her: Over the past two years, she's won just two matches at all three events. Combined. But Garbiñe Muguruza is the last obstacle Serena Williams will have to face on Saturday if she is to complete a second Serena Slam, and place herself three-fourths of the way towards a Calendar Slam. And while you might not know Garbiñe Muguruza, Serena Williams certainly does. The 21-year-old handed the dominant Serena her worst Grand Slam defeat at last year's French Open, scalding her 6-2, 6-2 in just 64 minutes. In January, the pair met at the Australian Open and produced one of the better matches of the entire tournament. Serena ended up taking the contest 6-2 in the third set, but that scoreline is somewhat deceiving of the tussle that preceded it. After all, Muguruza badly botched a volley that would have given her a break lead early in that decisive set. She couldn't recover, and Serena ended up taking the title three rounds later. Born in Venezuela, Muguruza moved to Spain at age six, though, atypically for that nation's players, she has a game better suited to faster surfaces rather than the venerated red clay. If you caught some of her semifinal win over former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska, you were probably awed by the very obvious power Garbiñe possesses. Few women on tour hit the ball with her kind of pace, and she can generate without much fuss on either her forehand or her backhand side. However, behind all that pace, there are quite a few nuances that make her game fascinating to watch. An ideal Muguruza point is one where she is able to be aggressive with either her forehand or her backhand. She is unafraid to change the direction of the ball, but she's more consistent and effective when she does it with her two-handed backhand – the more solid wing. Muguruza loves to step inside the baseline and bully people around. She loves to hit sharp cross-court backhands, but she is also very adept at surprising people with down-the-line shots off that side, which become doubly devastating when you see how hard she hits them. Muguruza is also a tactically sound player. This Wimbledon she's played a slew of very good, but flawed, players on her way to the final. Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Timea Bacsinszky and Radwanska are all ranked between 5 and 15 in the world. They're all excellent defenders, and great returners of serve. They all have phenomenal backhands. And they all have two problematic weaknesses: Unimposing forehands and very soft second serves. In all of these matches, Muguruza targeted those weaknesses and reaped the rewards. You'd expect a tall woman like Muguruza – she's a genuine 6-footer – to possess a deadly serve, and she cracks the Top 10 in percentage of first serve points won and total percentage of serve points won. She also possesses deceptive athleticism, able to hold her own when forced to cover large areas of the court. Not only that, but she tends to produce very effective defensive or counter-punching shots from difficult positions of the court. So why hasn't she even been ranked higher than 19th in the world? How does she only have one WTA title to her name? Well, there are a few reasons: Muguruza essentially wiped out the second half of her very promising 2013 season in order to have surgery on her ankle. She also took the opportunity to fix an issue with her nasal septum that was giving her breathing problems. There was also the somewhat political, yet ultimately very private issue of choosing which country to represent in international competitions like the Fed Cup and the Olympics. Muguruza was indecisive for a year and a half, and it took a toll: \"It was terrible. Everybody was asking me, 'Why don't you play for Spain? Why don't you play for Venezuela?'\" she said. \"It was an important decision. My family is involved, my tennis, everything.\" More than anything, Muguruza has been learning how to harness her powerful game week in and week out. After all, figuring out how to execute at the highest level on a consistent basis is the most challenging task a tennis player faces in his or her professional life. Muguruza is prone to excellent results at big tournaments – she's made the quarterfinals at the French Open two years in a row now – but Garbiñe is also liable to go through spells where anyone can beat her. If she loses the tactical compass of a match, she starts to mistrust her forehand, the double faults start pouring in (she cracks the Top 10 in that category, too), bad body language takes a hold and soon enough, she's gone. In 2015, the Spaniard has lost in her first or second match at 8 of the 13 events she's entered. But through all the ups and downs, the immense potential was easy to see. And even when guessing how far Garbiñe would go in a given event can be hazardous, there has been one common thread so far: If Muguruza ended up in a big show court, she wasn't likely to shrink from the spotlight. \"I like to play on the big courts, don't have fear of the big names,\" she said back in February. And, here's what she had to say on Twitter after her semifinal win yesterday: FINAL!!!!! QUIERO MAS! I WANT MORE! @Wimbledon #2015 pic.twitter.com/lLORUhCrRB — Garbiñe Muguruza (@GarbiMuguruza) July 9, 2015 This attitude will certainly come in handy as Garbiñe makes her Slam final debut against a woman making her 25th appearance on such a stage. Muguruza will also have the benefit of not having to carry the bulk of the pressure, since most expect Serena to handle the newbie and claim that most impressive second Serena Slam. But you better believe Serena will be wary of the situation. She knows the woman 12 years her junior is not the least bit intimidated by her or the opportunity. And she's very much aware of how devastating Garbiñe Muguruza's tennis can be when it comes together like it has during this fortnight at Wimbledon. Making history is never easy. 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",

But Garbiñe Muguruza is the last obstacle Serena Williams will have to face on Saturday if she is to complete a second Serena Slam, and place herself three-fourths of the way towards a Calendar Slam. And while you might not know Garbiñe Muguruza, Serena Williams certainly does. The 21-year-old handed the dominant Serena her worst Grand Slam defeat at last year's French Open, scalding her 6-2, 6-2 in just 64 minutes. In January, the pair met at the Australian Open and produced one of the better matches of the entire tournament. Serena ended up taking the contest 6-2 in the third set, but that scoreline is somewhat deceiving of the tussle that preceded it. After all, Muguruza badly botched a volley that would have given her a break lead early in that decisive set. She couldn't recover, and Serena ended up taking the title three rounds later. Born in Venezuela, Muguruza moved to Spain at age six, though, atypically for that nation's players, she has a game better suited to faster surfaces rather than the venerated red clay. If you caught some of her semifinal win over former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska, you were probably awed by the very obvious power Garbiñe possesses. Few women on tour hit the ball with her kind of pace, and she can generate without much fuss on either her forehand or her backhand side. However, behind all that pace, there are quite a few nuances that make her game fascinating to watch. An ideal Muguruza point is one where she is able to be aggressive with either her forehand or her backhand. She is unafraid to change the direction of the ball, but she's more consistent and effective when she does it with her two-handed backhand – the more solid wing. Muguruza loves to step inside the baseline and bully people around. She loves to hit sharp cross-court backhands, but she is also very adept at surprising people with down-the-line shots off that side, which become doubly devastating when you see how hard she hits them. Muguruza is also a tactically sound player. This Wimbledon she's played a slew of very good, but flawed, players on her way to the final. Angelique Kerber, Caroline Wozniacki, Timea Bacsinszky and Radwanska are all ranked between 5 and 15 in the world. They're all excellent defenders, and great returners of serve. They all have phenomenal backhands. And they all have two problematic weaknesses: Unimposing forehands and very soft second serves. In all of these matches, Muguruza targeted those weaknesses and reaped the rewards. You'd expect a tall woman like Muguruza – she's a genuine 6-footer – to possess a deadly serve, and she cracks the Top 10 in percentage of first serve points won and total percentage of serve points won. She also possesses deceptive athleticism, able to hold her own when forced to cover large areas of the court. Not only that, but she tends to produce very effective defensive or counter-punching shots from difficult positions of the court. So why hasn't she even been ranked higher than 19th in the world? How does she only have one WTA title to her name? Well, there are a few reasons: Muguruza essentially wiped out the second half of her very promising 2013 season in order to have surgery on her ankle. She also took the opportunity to fix an issue with her nasal septum that was giving her breathing problems. There was also the somewhat political, yet ultimately very private issue of choosing which country to represent in international competitions like the Fed Cup and the Olympics. Muguruza was indecisive for a year and a half, and it took a toll: \"It was terrible. Everybody was asking me, 'Why don't you play for Spain? Why don't you play for Venezuela?'\" she said. \"It was an important decision. My family is involved, my tennis, everything.\" More than anything, Muguruza has been learning how to harness her powerful game week in and week out. After all, figuring out how to execute at the highest level on a consistent basis is the most challenging task a tennis player faces in his or her professional life. Muguruza is prone to excellent results at big tournaments – she's made the quarterfinals at the French Open two years in a row now – but Garbiñe is also liable to go through spells where anyone can beat her. If she loses the tactical compass of a match, she starts to mistrust her forehand, the double faults start pouring in (she cracks the Top 10 in that category, too), bad body language takes a hold and soon enough, she's gone. In 2015, the Spaniard has lost in her first or second match at 8 of the 13 events she's entered. But through all the ups and downs, the immense potential was easy to see. And even when guessing how far Garbiñe would go in a given event can be hazardous, there has been one common thread so far: If Muguruza ended up in a big show court, she wasn't likely to shrink from the spotlight. \"I like to play on the big courts, don't have fear of the big names,\" she said back in February. And, here's what she had to say on Twitter after her semifinal win yesterday: FINAL!!!!! QUIERO MAS! I WANT MORE! @Wimbledon #2015 pic.twitter.com/lLORUhCrRB — Garbiñe Muguruza (@GarbiMuguruza) July 9, 2015. This attitude will certainly come in handy as Garbiñe makes her Slam final debut against a woman making her 25th appearance on such a stage. Muguruza will also have the benefit of not having to carry the bulk of the pressure, since most expect Serena to handle the newbie and claim that most impressive second Serena Slam. But you better believe Serena will be wary of the situation. She knows the woman 12 years her junior is not the least bit intimidated by her or the opportunity. And she's very much aware of how devastating Garbiñe Muguruza's tennis can be when it comes together like it has during this fortnight at Wimbledon. Making history is never easy.",

    "DiffbotBody": "If you are at Chicago's Midway Airport or on board a Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) flight in the days ahead, don't be surprised if you see a lot of smiling Southwest flight attendants in your midst. Midway is Southwest's largest hub, and home base for many of the carrier's flight attendants. Late last week, the executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, who represent more than 13,500 Southwest flight attendants altogether, voted to approve a tentative new contract, which over the next several weeks will be presented to the full membership to ratify. A spokesman for Local 556 today said the vote on the new contract should be completed by the end of July. If, as expected, the contract is approved by the full union membership, Southwest flight attendants would, according to Local 556 President and lead negotiator Audrey Stone, \"continue to be the highest paid in the (airline) industry through 2019.\" The new contract also would be retroactive to 2013 when negotiations began. A spokesman for Local 556 said the contract does include pay raises for flight attendants, who in turn would agree to work rule revisions in exchange for the higher pay. Full details of the tentative new collective bargaining agreement will be released soon, the Local said. Southwest's tentative new contract with its flight attendants, however, still leaves the low-fare behemoth without new contracts with three major units in its workforce — pilots, mechanics and ramp agents who handle baggage and other crucial plane servicing functions at the gate. Southwest flight attendants were in negotiations for two years on their new contract. But ramp agents, who are growing increasingly restless, have been without a new contract for some four years. A large group of ramp agents recently picketed Southwest's annual meeting, and ramp agents who were unhappy about the excruciatingly slow progress of contract talks are believed to have been a key factor in the historic Southwest Airlines meltdown at Midway Airport in early 2014 that left 16 Southwest planes filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. The recent picketing and other rumblings about labor unrest at Southwest may have prompted Southwest CEO Gary Kelly to speed up efforts to get new contracts with all of the various unions who comprise his airline's workforce. Any major concerns about possible employee strikes could cause Southwest customers to consider booking flights with competitors instead.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Dylann Roof should not have been allowed to buy a gun and only did so because of breakdowns in the federal criminal background system, the FBI’s director said Friday. Online For complete coverage of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church, including victim profiles, videos, photo galleries and more, go to postandcourier.com/church-shooting. Director James Comey attributed the problem to incomplete and inaccurate paperwork related to an arrest of Roof weeks before the shooting. How it happened: The background-check lapse The problem unfolded like this: Roof went to buy the .45-caliber pistol on April 11 from a licensed firearms dealer, Shooter’s Choice, in West Columbia. The background check examiner assigned to Roof’s case identified through South Carolina records an arrest on a drug charge. But the arresting agency that was listed, for reasons Comey said were unclear, was the Lexington County Sheriff’s Office. The actual arresting agency was the Columbia Police Department. Had she (the examiner) reached that police force, she would have seen the arrest report in which Roof admitted having the drug Suboxone, which is used to treat opiate addiction, Comey said. Instead, she followed up with the county sheriff’s office and the county prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor never responded, and the county sheriff suggested that she check with the Columbia police force. The West Virginia-based background examiner knew the arrest took place in Lexington County, but when she consulted her list of county police agencies, she did not see the Columbia police force. That department was listed in Richland County — where most of the city is located. That list, or contact sheet, in retrospect should have identified both counties as home to the city of Columbia. When she did not see Columbia on her list, she selected what she thought was the most reasonable alternative — West Columbia, where the gun shop was located — but the police department there also said it had no record of Roof’s arrest. Before she could track down the police report, the three-day window lapsed and the transaction went through on April 16. Source: The Associated Press “We are all sick that this has happened,” Comey told reporters in an unusual, hastily scheduled meeting at FBI headquarters. “We wish we could turn back time because, from this vantage point, everything seems obvious. But we cannot.” Roof, 21, bought a .45-caliber Glock in April before authorities said he showed up June 17 at Emanuel AME Church and fatally shot nine people. He had been arrested in February after Columbia police officers said they found him at a mall with prescription drugs. Police say he admitted at the time to possessing illegal drugs. Under federal rules, that admission alone should have disqualified him, even though he wasn’t convicted of the charge. Roof was booked at the Lexington County Detention Center on Feb. 28 after being arrested by the Columbia Police Department. Roof originally was charged with a felony for the drug offense. A search for those arrest documents Friday shows it changed to a misdemeanor charge. Lexington County court records show that Roof in March faced a first-offense charge for possession of a controlled substance without a prescription that officials said is a misdemeanor. The FBI background check examiner who evaluated Roof’s request to buy a gun never saw the arrest report because the wrong arresting agency was listed on the rap sheet that she reviewed, Comey said. Had the West Virginia-based examiner seen the Columbia police report, the purchase would have been denied, Comey said. The request was on hold for three business days as the FBI examiner sought information about whether it should be approved or rejected. Once that window closed, the firearms dealer — Shooter’s Choice in West Columbia — used its legal discretion to allow the sale to be completed. “If she (the FBI examiner) had seen that police report,” Comey said, “that purchase would have been denied.” That’s a weakness not only in the federal law but in South Carolina laws, said Jonathan Hutson, of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “South Carolina has some of the weakest gun laws and slowest reporting in the nation. Every day in South Carolina, people like Roof are able to buy guns online or at gun shows with no questions asked.” The Brady center is pushing for passage of a congressional bill that would expand the checks to online sales and gun shows, as well as provide $400 million to states’ law enforcement agencies to submit reports faster. The FBI refused a Post and Courier request for a follow-up interview with Comey. Andre Duncan, nephew of shooting victim Myra Thompson, who rode with a group to Washington to support the bill’s passage, said it could only help. But if Roof slipped through the cracks, there’s really nothing that can be done. “It puts me back. I’m at a loss for words when it comes to that,” Duncan said. “I don’t want to hear any more about him on the computer, on the TV, in social media. I just want to keep moving away from it as an individual, as a community and a country.” When Columbia police searched Roof’s jacket pockets Feb. 28 at the Columbiana Centre mall, where he had been asking employees suspicious questions, Roof said the strips that officers found were Listerine, according to the arrest report. Pressed for more answers, he acknowledged that they were Suboxone, a prescription drug used to treat opiate addiction. Asked if he had a prescription, he “stated that he did not,” the police report said. He was arrested and booked into the Richland County jail the next day. He was later released on his own recognizance. Comey said he learned about the problem on Thursday night and that FBI officials planned to meet Friday with relatives of the nine victims of last month’s church shooting in Charleston. He told The New York Times he had also directed an internal 30-day review into how the FBI uses criminal background checks in gun transactions. The background check is not foolproof. If a check does not come back before the three-day waiting period ends, a gun can be sold without it. That lapse led to the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 33 people. And it’s not difficult for people who can’t buy guns to come up with one. Columbia attorney Arthur Aiken, who defends clients against gun violation charges, said he didn’t know how often background checks break down, but that he had not come across it in his practice. But with “straw” purchases by another person and other means to get a handgun, he wondered if the check’s failure would have made a difference. “He legally bought a gun and probably shouldn’t have gotten it that way,” Aiken said. “But he could have gotten it other ways.” Comey’s announcement came within hours of the Confederate flag’s removal from the S.C. Statehouse grounds. Families of the victims attended the ceremony. State Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, who also has pushed for stricter gun laws, said thorough background checks and a longer waiting period are needed, but in the case of Roof, “There’s enough blame to go around everybody, in all fairness.” Editor’s note: Earlier versions of this story contained an error.

Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

North Korea’s old ruse falters North Korea’s latest violent provocation of South Korea ended with an agreement that appears to break an old pattern. The South may have learned how to deal with the North’s attempts to intimidate. The Monitor's View. Africa’s democratic road to economic unity With the launch of an ambitious project to form a free-trade zone, Africa must also realize that trade is best enhanced when states are democratic. The Monitor's View. New Orleans’ thanks for post-Katrina volunteers To mark the 10th anniversary of its devastating hurricane, New Orleans called on citizens to volunteer in service projects, a celebration of the generosity shown the city by private givers over the past decade. Upfront Blog. Cities worth rebuilding New Orleans and all cities arise because people join together. When they are knocked down, that same spirit helps them rise again. The Monitor's View. Taproot for Europe's migrant crisis The largest share of refugees streaming into Europe is from Syria. Solving the war there is as important as dealing with the symptom of Syrians crossing the Mediterranean to find peace. The Monitor's View. As China’s economy cools, a hot debate on graft Critics contend that China’s anti-corruption campaign has helped to slow the economy. But the evidence points to honest governance as better for growth, if integrity in officials can be promoted. The Monitor's View. New ways to protect the innocent in war As the nature of war changes, the International Committee of the Red Cross is struggling to ensure compliance with the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Conventions. Even the most extreme militants must be convinced of the need to protect civilians. The Monitor's View. Seeing Ukraine as an opportunity A renewed cease-fire, debt restructuring, and more reforms are helping transform Ukraine from a crisis into an opportunity for Europe. The Monitor's View. The global call for more border walls Donald Trump’s promise of a secure wall on the US-Mexican border reflects a trend in many nations to fortify their boundaries. A better course lies in more cooperation between countries and tackling root causes of perceived border threats. Upfront Blog. A revolution comes in layers The \"energy crisis\" hit like a locomotive in the 1970s. Today's \"energy revolution\" didn't happen suddenly. It grew out millions of innovations, processes, and decisions. The Monitor's View.

    "DiffbotBody": "HOLLY Ferling will usher in a new era for women's cricket after being unveiled today as the first signing of the WBBBL Brisbane Heat team. The 19-year-old fast bowler will spearhead the Brisbane side in the inaugural Women's Big Bash League during December and January. Ferling joins fellow Kingaroy product Matthew Hayden as the first signing of the Brisbane Heat. Hayden was the face of the Heat at the KFC T20 Big Bash League in 2011. Ferling joined the other eight club's marquee players today in Sydney to officially launch the new T20 league, which will be broadcast on Network Ten's ONE station. Born and raised in Kingaroy, where she made history by taking a hat-trick as a 14-year-old in her first game of senior men's cricket, Ferling said she was honoured to be a part of the maiden WBBL side for Brisbane. \"All the girls are really excited, I think it's just going to push our profile, the team's profile, and also women's cricket that couple of steps further,\" she said. \"The BBL has become such an integral part of our summer and it will be wonderful to have the opportunity to be a part of that through our own competition.\" Ferling said the new competition would see women's cricket pushed into the public's eye. \"I think it's something we've been waiting to happen with women's cricket,\" she said. \"And then seasons to come, like we have seen with men's Big Bash, it's just going to get bigger and better every year. \"I really think the next five years, women's cricket is really going to take off.\" The WBBL Heat will be coached by current Konica Minolta Queensland Fire coach Andy Richards, who was in charge when the Fire won their maiden WT20 title in 2013-14 \"It's an exciting time for women's cricket and the game in general with the creation of the WBBL,'' Richards said. \"We've worked very hard over the years to achieve our goals and the WBBL provides all of us with added incentive to perform at our very best. \"We've seen the impact the BBL has made on families and attracting new fans, but this competition will allow girls starting out in the game to have some ready-made role models,'' he said. Brisbane Heat head coach Dan Vettori welcomed the arrival of a sister team. \"It's pretty exciting being part of something new like the WBBL and I'm sure we will all enjoy the chance to support each other along the way, especially in the double-headers that have been scheduled,'' he said. The WBBL Heat will announce further signings in the near future, with clubs to have two international players and a squad of 14 contracted players. They will play their home matches at Allan Border Field and the Gabba. The WBBL is designed to attract more women and girls to play cricket at all levels, with world class sportswomen inspiring the next generation of players, fans and volunteers. The new format, which replaces the previous state-based women's T20 competition, will see eight teams - mirroring the men's KFC Big Bash League (BBL) - compete in 59 matches over 51 days, culminating in the final on Sunday 24 January 2016.

    "DiffbotBody": "During his stint as the head coach of the New York Jets, Ryan got a tattoo of his wife wearing nothing but a green Jets jersey. Once he got the boot from New York and wound up in Buffalo, Ryan took a big step towards remedying his tattoo dilemma. The brash coach decided to change the color of his wife’s jersey in his tattoo to blue, the color of the Bills’ home uniforms. While Ryan’s tattoo is definitely unique, it pales in comparison to some of the head-scratching “ink” of several other professional sports figures. Anytime you watch a professional sporting event, you are sure to see at least one interesting tattoo. Likewise, at some point in time, we’ve all probably looked at a professional athlete’s tattoo(s) and wondered, “What was he thinking?” The propensity of athletes getting tattoos could be a matter of them wanting to express themselves, or it could simply be that they have a lot of free time and a lot of disposable income. In honor of Rex Ryan, we have compiled a list of seven of the worst tattoos in professional sports history. 1. Kenyon Martin For reasons that only Martin will ever understand, he chose to tattoo the lips of Trina, his ex-girlfriend and successful rap artist, onto his neck in red ink. The couple has long since broken up, and Martin has now changed the infamous tattoo to something that now resembles a crown. 2. Chris “Birdman” Anderson The Birdman is one of the more colorful players in the NBA – no pun intended. He is one of the more popular role players in NBA history, and that is in large part due to his free spirit style and the colorful “Free Bird” tattoo he has running across his neck. 3. Scott Spiezio Spiezio played a sport where uniforms cover most tattoos. That hasn’t stopped the former major leaguer from showing off the tattoo he has of his girlfriend that runs from his shoulder to his elbow. 4. DeShawn Stevenson One of the oddest tattoos in profession sports belongs to former NBA player DeShawn Stevenson. He has what resembles a five-dollar bill tattooed across his neck. His reasoning behind the tattoo is actually commendable. He chose to have a tattoo of Abraham Lincoln to honor the former president for his anti-slavery work. After constantly being asked whom the tattoo represented, Stevenson added the fives on both sides to represent the five-dollar bill. 5. Larry Sanders This may be the dumbest tattoo in the history of professional sports. Sanders wanted to have “Receive” tattooed on his hand, and ended up getting “Recieve.” Too bad tattoo guns don’t have a spellcheck feature. 6. Shawn Merriman Merriman took his nickname of “Lights Out” and turned it into one of the most ridiculous tattoos in professional sports. 7. Brian Urlacher “Hey Brian, Pamela Anderson called, and she wants her tattoo back!” If it weren’t for Urlacher’s stature, he likely would hear jokes like this on a daily basis. With that being said, it’s still hard to comprehend the thought process that goes into getting a barbed wire tattoo. Want more great content like this?

If you watch, you will get to know him, fast: He's the one who refers to his two competitors -- agents Roh Habibi and Justin Fichelson -- as amateurs who were \"going to the prom\" when he was already a seasoned professional.

(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) Q Are you surprised to find yourself on this new show? It presents you and your two competitors as if you were pop culture icons. A I don't know if I'd call myself that. I'm just a real estate agent with a camera following me around. Q Tell me about the drama of the deal. Why does it translate to TV? A When you're dealing with someone who has large assets, the emotions run raw and there are no rules. It's a no-rules game. It's one of the most stressful and crazy things about the business, but it's also what makes it exciting. You can get up in the morning and close a deal by noon, but you can also totally lose that deal by noon. Q On the show, you come across as unusually competitive. A You have to be. This is a high-stakes game. There's no messing around. Q Is the show already bringing you new business? A Yeah, I think it's really going to ramp up. People come through an open house and the cameras are there -- it adds a little extra level of desire for them. People want to feel close to the show, close to the brokers. Q Do you feel any remorse over being someone who helps drive this crazy real estate market? The region is becoming unaffordable for most people.

    "DiffbotBody": "news Dearborn, Michigan has been completely taken over by Muslims, and now the police there are being forced to submit to Shariah law in a despicable way. It all started when a woman named Malak Kazan filed a lawsuit against the Dearborn Police Department after she was forced to remove her hijab for booking when she was arrested. The case was eventually settled out of court, but it inspired the police department to make some dangerous changes to their procedures. According to Conservative Tribune, the new policy will allow women to keep their hijabs on during booking, despite the fact that they could be hiding illegal weapons or materials underneath it. The policy will also ensure that a female officer, dispatcher, or employee will perform pat downs on Muslim women, instead of male officers. “I think this is the best policy that any local municipality or law enforcement agency can have for their inmates and Muslim women,” said Amir Makled, one of Kazan’s attorneys. “This will be used as the base line for all local enforcement agencies to set a policy and mirror what we have here.” Yes, you read that right: Kazan’s attorneys intend to fight for this to became a NATIONWIDE policy. This policy would open the door for criminals of both genders to hide all sorts of illegal materials under a hijab or a burqa. Women are not asked to take off their hijabs during booking to demean them: they are asked to do it for public safety. Policies like this represent the beginning of a potential Muslim takeover in the U.S. This has already happened in Europe, and we can NOT let that happen here! What do you think about this?

    "DiffbotBody": "Before he was the brains behind Hollywood blockbuster bromances like Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Judd Apatow executive produced Freaks and Geeks, a coming of age comedy that follows two teenage siblings growing up in early 1980s Michigan. More than most teen TV, Freak and Geeks honestly presents the confusion, excitement, and crippling awkwardness that personify adolescence. For all the show’s wit and warmth, however, NBC cancelled it after just one season. Long before the golden age of serial dramas, cinematic auteur and all around weirdo David Lynch brought viewers an extended murder mystery set in one of the strangest towns in all of television. The mystery of who killed high school beauty queen Laura Palmer sets up the main plot of Twin Peaks, but the show’s true focus is the eponymous town’s bizarre cast of characters and general mystique. Equal parts quirky, occult, humorous, and horrifying, Twin Peaks lasted just two seasons before cancellation. Set in the studio of a fictionalized late night talk show, HBO’s The Larry Sanders Show was one of the most influential series of the 1990s, inspiring both the cringe comedy of Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Office and the behind the scenes style of 30 Rock. Starring Gary Shandling as the show’s eponymous host, the series blurred the line between fiction and reality, featuring real celebrities portraying dramatized versions of themselves. Newsroom sitcom Murphy Brown broke new ground when its eponymous lead became pregnant during the show’s fourth season, choosing to raise her baby as a single mother. While celebrity newscasters like Katie Couric and Paula Zhan wished Murphy well at her baby shower, the plotline drew the ire of Vice President Dan Quayle, who criticized the show for ignoring the importance of fathers. Murphy Brown responded to critics in its fifth season opener, which highlighted the diversity of contemporary American families. Long before The Walking Dead drew major ratings with its post-apocalyptic setting, CBS drama Jericho fictionalized a far different doomsday scenario: a massive nuclear strike that wipes out every major American city. As residents of the small Midwestern town of Jericho struggle to survive in a lawless world, hile hints of a shadowy conspiracy indicate the U.S. government may have had some part in the attacks. Unfortunately, the show arrived too early for the apocalypse craze, and Jericho was cancelled after two seasons. Arrested Development was one of the most critically acclaimed comedies of the 2000s, but the inventive show struggled with ratings through its three season run. Focusing on the exploits of the eccentric Bluth family, the show follows voice of reason Michael as he struggles to keep his selfish, materialistic clan together after their patriarch is imprisoned for corporate fraud. While FOX cancelled the show in 2006, it found new life as a Netflix exclusive in 2013. Before personal computing entered the mainstream, British cyberpunk series Max Headroom envisioned a dystopian future in which corporations control the world through media and technology. Protagonist Edison Carter is an investigative journalist whose reporting works to expose corporate corruption, but an accident causes his consciousness to be uploaded online, creating the digital alter ego Max Headroom. The edgy drama ran just 14 episodes but influenced countless other science fiction shows. A young Claire Danes stars in My So-Called Life, a teen drama that rivals Freaks and Geeks in both compassion and emotional honesty. Angela Chase struggles with dating, sex, friendships, and family, but My So-Called Life never strays into the melodrama that characterizes so much teen TV. Characters like bookish Brian Krakow, rebellious Rayanne Graff, sensitive Ricky Vasquesz, and brooding heartthrob Jordan Catalano make the show a classic of 90s television. Airing for just one season in the early 90s, NBC’s Eerie, Indiana played like The Twilight Zone for kids, introducing occult, offbeat mysteries each week. Teenage Marshall Teller moves to the town of Eerie, Indiana, home to some of the most concentrated American weirdness this side of Twin Peaks. From Bigfoot and Elvis to a retainer that bestows the ability to read dogs’ minds, Eerie, Indiana specialized in a kind of refined eccentricity that was totally uncommon at the time. CBS’s 1980s adaptation of the classical fairy tale was two decades ahead of its time, and it lasted just three seasons. Linda Hamilton stars as a young lawyer who discovers a secret fantasy world beneath New York City, falling in love with Vincent, the realm’s beastly protector. The show’s mix of romantic and supernatural prefigured popular modern dramas like Twilight, but the combination proved too adventurous for audiences of the time. Taking an intimate look at the staff of a fictional sports news show, Aaron Sorkin’s late 90s sitcom paved the way for other behind the scenes dramas like 30 Rock and the writer’s own The West Wing and The Newsroom. Featuring one of TV’s most enduringly dysfunctional casts, Sports Night launched the careers of both Felicity Huffman and Peter Krause, but the show was cancelled after just two seasons. Years before the unconventional humor of shows like Arrested Development and South Park, FOX’s short-lived sitcom Get a Life trafficked in a kind of subversive wit that made it destined for both cancellation and cult status. Starring comedian Chris Elliot as a 30-year-old paperboy who still lives with his parents, the show featured surreal plot points that were downright revolutionary for the early 90s, including the protagonist’s actual death in 12 different episodes. Before his pioneering work on Freaks and Geeks, Judd Apatow broke a different kind of comedic ground with friend Ben Stiller on MTV’s short lived sketch comedy The Ben Stiller Show. Offbeat, irreverent, and daringly free of a laugh track, the show was filled with burgeoning talent, including Andy Dick, Janeane Garofalo and Bob Odenkirk. A surrealistic parody of classic cop shows like Hawaii-Five O and Dragnet, ABC’s 1982 series Police Squad! ran for only six episodes but went on to spawn the Naked Gun franchise. Filled with slapstick and bizarre non-sequitur humor, the show also embraced innovative postmodern flourishes, such as an opening sequence in which guest stars are introduced and then promptly killed off in different ways. In the age of tortured, only occasionally sympathetic protagonists like Don Draper and Walter White, it’s easy to root for the antihero. Back in 1996, however, FOX’s grim corporate drama Profit made it just eight episodes before cancelation. Series protagonist Jim Profit’s twisted childhood, vicious business acumen, and near sociopathic personal life are the stuff of modern prestige serial dramas, but audiences at the time found them too dark to keep tuning in. A parody of conventional comic book superheroes, The Tick’s hulking protagonist patrols the City with his straight man sidekick and often annoyed roommate Arthur, battling goofy villains like The Breadmaster and Chairface Chippendale. Undoubtedly one of the strangest, wittiest kids shows to ever achieve airtime, The Tick paved the way for the host of grown up cartoons found in Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim block. Emerging in the psychedelic 60s, The Prisoner looked, acted, and felt like no show before it. Referred to only as the cryptic “Number 6,” Patrick McGoohan stars as a former spy trapped in a strange coastal village along with other mysterious captives. Combining elements of spy thrillers, science fiction, and psychological drama, the show offers a level of style and sophistication that are still gratifying today. Long before vampires and zombies ascended to pop cultural prominence, Joss Whedon’s perpetual underdog series Buffy the Vampire Slayer combined teen drama, supernatural action, and genuine wit into a fan favorite show that outclasses most modern paranormal romances. Buffy Summers battles vampires and demons by night while traversing the perils of high school by day, in a show that’s alternately tender, funny, and terrifying. The Twilight Zone wasn’t the first science fiction anthology series, but it was the series with the greatest impact, introducing sci-fi and fantasy tropes to legions of viewers and influencing countless other programs. Writer Rod Serling fought hard for creative control of the series, offering up highly politicized stories highlighting issues like racism, gender roles, and censorship. The show’s cutting edge content struggled to attract viewers, but The Twilight Zone forged an unforgettable legacy in both science fiction and television in general. Embracing foul-mouthed toilet humor and grotesque animation, Nickelodeon’s questionably kid appropriate Ren and Stimpy ranks as one of the most influential cartoons of the 90s, opening the door to classic adult animation like South Park and Beavis and Butt-head. While it drew criticism for its violence and crude jokes, the show also provided an aesthetic influence for more wholesome shows like SpongBob SquarePants.",
    "LabBody": "Freaks and Geeks. Before he was the brains behind Hollywood blockbuster bromances like Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Judd Apatow executive produced Freaks and Geeks, a coming of age comedy that follows two teenage siblings growing up in early 1980s Michigan. More than most teen TV, Freak and Geeks honestly presents the confusion, excitement, and crippling awkwardness that personify adolescence. For all the show’s wit and warmth, however, NBC cancelled it after just one season. Twin Peaks. Long before the golden age of serial dramas, cinematic auteur and all around weirdo David Lynch brought viewers an extended murder mystery set in one of the strangest towns in all of television. The mystery of who killed high school beauty queen Laura Palmer sets up the main plot of Twin Peaks, but the show’s true focus is the eponymous town’s bizarre cast of characters and general mystique. Equal parts quirky, occult, humorous, and horrifying, Twin Peaks lasted just two seasons before cancellation. The Larry Sanders Show. Set in the studio of a fictionalized late night talk show, HBO’s The Larry Sanders Show was one of the most influential series of the 1990s, inspiring both the cringe comedy of Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Office and the behind the scenes style of 30 Rock. Starring Gary Shandling as the show’s eponymous host, the series blurred the line between fiction and reality, featuring real celebrities portraying dramatized versions of themselves. Murphy Brown. Newsroom sitcom Murphy Brown broke new ground when its eponymous lead became pregnant during the show’s fourth season, choosing to raise her baby as a single mother. While celebrity newscasters like Katie Couric and Paula Zhan wished Murphy well at her baby shower, the plotline drew the ire of Vice President Dan Quayle, who criticized the show for ignoring the importance of fathers. Murphy Brown responded to critics in its fifth season opener, which highlighted the diversity of contemporary American families.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Every year, the TV landscape gets a little more crowded. There's never been a better time to be a TV viewer, but with so many options, it can also get a little overwhelming. Which TV shows are worth your time? Let The Week be your guide. Read through our list of the most promising shows of the season, and a few new names to your DVR lineup. (We're only including shows with a set release date, and will update the list as other great shows nail down their premiere dates.) 1. Outlander (Starz, April 4) After several misbegotten stabs at period dramas, Starz scored with this buzzy adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's series of historical fantasy novels. Caitriona Balfe stars as a World War II combat nurse who travels back in time to Scotland's civil war in 1743. It might sound a little goofy, but Outlander sells the premise with style, leaping deftly from genre to genre for a story that's not quite like anything else on television. 2. Wolf Hall (PBS, April 5) Hilary Mantel's brilliant novel about the court of King Henry VIII — told from the perspective of his often-maligned advisor Thomas Cromwell — gets a lavish small-screen adaptation. Tony-winning stage actor Mark Rylance stars as Cromwell, leading a cast that includes Homeland's Damian Lewis as King Henry. Wolf Hall's dense reappraisal of British history packs in all the political intrigue of Game of Thrones, and a faithful adaptation should prove no less addictive or hypnotic. 3. Mad Men (AMC, April 5) What's left to be said about Mad Men? AMC's brilliant drama, which centers on a Manhattan advertising firm in the 1960s, has already secured its place among the great shows in television history. Last year's set of episodes, which made up the first half of Mad Men's final season, were some of the best in the show's entire run, and the show's sprawling ensemble cast is as deep (and uniformly excellent) as ever. With just seven episodes left, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to Mad Men, but that's no reason to miss a single second of the show's final hours. 4. Louie (FX, April 9) A justified critical darling, Louie C.K.'s experimental sitcom is one of TV's most unpredictable shows; by playing freely with form and style, C.K. ensures that viewers never know what they're going to see when they tune in. With Louie C.K. serving as creator, writer, director, and star — as well as a host of other jobs — Louie is one of TV's few true auteur projects. Watching an episode is like getting a glimpse into the acerbic comedian's brain. 5. Daredevil (Netflix, April 10) Marvel extends its superheroic empire with the first of four Netflix-exclusive dramas. Charlie Cox stars as Daredevil, a blind superhero who fights crime using his enhanced other senses. (The remaining three shows — centered on Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage — will premiere later, with a miniseries combining all four characters to follow.) Daredevil has a fiercely loyal following among comics fans, but the first major adaptation of his story, which starred Ben Affleck, failed to connect with audiences in 2003. Since then, Marvel has essentially rewritten the book on superhero adaptations, and it's hard to imagine it will botch the opportunity to reintroduce a character with so much potential to mainstream audiences. 6. Game of Thrones (HBO, April 12) Over four seasons, HBO's fantasy drama has achieved the kind of buzz most networks can only dream about, turning once-obscure phrases like \"Winter is Coming\" and \"Red Wedding\" into entrenched cultural catchphrases. Though many of the best moments from George R.R. Martin's novels have already occurred in the TV series, the fifth season of Game of Thrones is likely to be the most sprawling, with fan-favorite characters like Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark scattered across the world. TV shows rarely come more ambitious, or more compulsively watchable, than this. 7. Veep (HBO, April 12) Building on a third season that was easily the show's best, HBO's scathing political satire returns as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Selina Meyer — thrust into the nation's highest office after the unexpected resignation of the president — battles to keep her role in a contentious election. Veep is the ideal political satire for our time: hilarious, profane, and unfailingly committed to the idea that politicians on both sides of the aisle are petty, self-absorbed idiots. 8. Orphan Black (BBC America, April 18) The second season of Orphan Black was a step down from the addictive, propulsive first, but no matter how much it went off the rails, the sci-fi head-scratcher would be worth watching solely on the basis of its star. Over the course of the series, Tatiana Maslany has successfully played more than a dozen separate characters (all clones), and the third season adds a new adversary in a set of male clones (Ari Millen). 9. Happyish (Showtime, April 26) The genesis of Happyish is a sad story: the dramedy originally starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had already filmed the pilot before his sudden death. Those who have seen the originally Happyish pilot have testified to Hoffman's brilliance in the lead role, and while it's a shame that viewers will never get to see him in a recurring TV role, the new version of Happyish — which replaces Hoffman with Steve Coogan — still has plenty of promise. Happyish follows Thom Payne, a middle-aged ad executive who pushes back against a youth-driven culture as he staves off his own sense of irrelevance. 10. Penny Dreadful (Showtime, May 3) Forget Homeland and The Affair — the best series on Showtime is Penny Dreadful. This wonderfully morbid period horror-drama packs in all the best elements of gothic fiction: ornate dialogue, gorgeous locales, a lavish orchestral score, and a never-ending stream of creepy, otherworldly creatures to tempt our heroes into succumbing to their darker sides. Anchored by an unmissable performance from Eva Green and an impressive comeback role for Josh Hartnett, Penny Dreadful is TV's most compelling horror show. 11. Wayward Pines (Fox, May 14) M. Night Shyamalan's offbeat thriller series is so clearly inspired by Twin Peaks that it almost borders on plagiarism — but if you're going to crib, you might as well crib from the best. Matt Dillon stars as a Secret Service agent sent to investigate the disappearance of two fellow agents in a small Idaho town, only to discover that the entire town is a bizarre slice of Americana filled with strange secrets. Based on Shyamalan's recent pedigree and the ludicrous teaser video, Wayward Pines could easily turn out to be a fiasco — but it definitely doesn't look boring. 12. Hannibal (NBC, June 4) Bryan Fuller's arty, gory take on the fictional killer is one of network TV's most unjustly overlooked dramas: gorgeous, strange, and embedded with a tense psychological depth. As Hannibal, Mads Mikkelsen is good enough to make you forget about Anthony Hopkins, and Hugh Dancy is every bit his equal as Will Graham, the troubled FBI profiler whose pursuit of Hannibal brought him to the brink of insanity. 13. Sense8 (Netflix, June 5) The Wachowskis have never equaled the towering, genre-expanding success of The Matrix, but no one can deny the ambition of their follow-up projects. Sense8, their first TV series (in a partnership with Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski), follows eight strangers from across the world who suddenly, inexplicably become mentally and emotionally linked. 14. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (Netflix, July 17) The cultshly adored comedic film — which follows a group of counselors through a surreal series of misadventures at a summer camp — is finally getting its long-discussed prequel in the form of a Netflix limited series. Impressively, the series has managed to assemble pretty much everybody from the movie's insanely stacked cast, including Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Paul Rudd, and Elizabeth Banks. TV shows that have already premiered: (Our original previews for each of these shows were published earlier this year. We've left those curtain-raisers untouched, but appended updates to each item.) 15. Agent Carter (ABC, January 6) After successfully reinvigorating its sophomore drama Agents of S.H.I.E.LD., Marvel is delving into its past with the limited series Agent Carter. The story picks up in the mid-1940s, shortly after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, as Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) embarks on a series of top-secret missions while combating the sexism of the era. This is Marvel's first project centered on a female protagonist, and a look back at the events that set up for blockbusters like Iron Man and The Avengers should provide a fresh and intriguing take on the Marvel universe. UPDATE: Agent Carter's brief run was praised by fans and critics alike, but so-so ratings may spell doom for a second season. ABC hasn't committed one way or the other yet. 16. Empire (Fox, January 7) Terrence Howard leads the gleefully soapy Empire as Lucious Lyon, a hip-hop mogul who must decide how to dispose of his vast fortune when he's diagnosed with ALS. Riffing on both King Lear and The Lion in Winter, Empire proudly wears its serialized ambitions on its sleeve, from an unusually large cast for a network drama (including a scene-stealing role from Taraji P. Henson) to a series of new songs from Timbaland. UPDATE: Empire is an astonishingly massive breakout hit, with ratings increasing week to week for every single one of its episodes — a virtually unprecedented feat in any era of TV, let alone an era with DVR and streaming services. The series will return for a second season. 17. Babylon (SundanceTV, January 8) Danny Boyle's dark satire follows an American public relations whiz (Brit Marling) hired to improve the sagging public image of London's Metropolitan Police Department. It's edgy, well-timed material, and the series wears its ambition on its sleeve, with a massive ensemble cast splitting perspectives between the PR team and the cops. UPDATE: Babylon was a solid performer in the U.K., but never caught on stateside. No word on a second season. 18. Girls (HBO, January 11) Girls' cultural footprint may be larger than its actual viewership, but there's still plenty to admire about Lena Dunham's unique depiction of life and love in your twenties. Season four takes a bold step by shifting the narrative away from Brooklyn, as Hannah Horvath (Dunham) begins a program at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. (Don't worry — the rest of the cast, including Adam Driver and Allison Williams, are staying put.) UPDATE: Girls' ratings have more or less plateaued — after four seasons, you probably know if you're a fan or not. The fourth season made bold choices by splitting up its protagonists into distinct narratives, and a flash-forward in the finale indicates that the schism will continue. The series has already been renewed for a fifth season. 19. Shameless (Showtime, January 11) For four seasons, Showtime's underappreciated dramedy has followed the ups and downs of the blue-collar Gallagher family, led by the deadbeat patriarch Frank (William H. Macy). Season five picks up shortly after Fiona (Emmy Rossum), the most responsible member of the family, is released from prison, getting back to life as usual as she sorts through her family's various dysfunctions. UPDATE: Shameless continues to quietly amass buzz and acclaim, with William H. Macy's lead performance winning a Screen Actors Guild Award in January. The series has been renewed for a sixth season. 20. Togetherness (HBO, January 11) The Duplass brothers take their talents to television for this warm dramedy about a pair of middle-aged couples attempting to put their lives in order. Unlike most of what ends up on television, there's no big hook for Togetherness; just a group of genial actors, including Mark Duplass and Amanda Peet, digging into their likably messy characters as they navigate life in Los Angeles. UPDATE: As Togetherness unrolled its narrative, it got darker, culminating in a cliffhanger that threatens the future of its central couple. Fortunately, viewers won't need to wait too long for resolution, as the series has been renewed for a second season. 21. Parks \u0026 Recreation (NBC, January 13) Following similarly beloved shows like 30 Rock and The Office into that good night, NBC's last truly brilliant sitcom ends its run with a final string of episodes that were teased in a flash-forward at the end of season six. Expect the show's final 13 episodes to serve as an extended love letter to the well-drawn characters and brilliant cast, from the relentlessly positive Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) to internet favorite Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) — as well as some intriguing new characters, like a hapless employee played by Jon Hamm. UPDATE: After seven seasons, Parks \u0026 Recreation ended its run with a string of terrific episodes, culminating in a series of flash-forwards revealing what happens to the characters years (and sometimes decades) after the series ends. 22. Broad City (Comedy Central, January 14) Comedy Central's wonderfully loopy series returns for a second season, as Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson navigate the travails of living in New York in your twenties. Aside from its two enormously appealing leads, Broad City's brilliance is in its elasticity; the series has no problem diverting from reality for any number of fantastical asides, offering scene after scene full of hilarious and unexpected turns. UPDATE: Broad City was even stronger in its sophomore season, netting universally positive reviews and an ever-growing roster of devoted viewers. The series will return for a third season. 23. The Fall (Netflix, January 16) It's been a long, long wait to see the next chapter in the chilling serial killer drama, but The Fall is finally set to pick up at the end of the first season's cliffhanger. Gillian Anderson stars as a police inspector on the trail of a sociopathic killer (Jamie Dornan, soon to debut as Fifty Shades of Grey's Christian Grey). The entire second season drops on Netflix on January 16, so set your binge-watching schedules accordingly. UPDATE: The Fall's second season was a hit abroad, and Netflix's unquenchable thirst for exclusive programs means it will always have a home in the United States. The series will return for a third season. 24. 12 Monkeys (Syfy, January 16) Nearly 20 years after its premiere, Terry Gilliam's cultishly beloved sci-fi movie makes its way to the small screen, with X-Men alum Aaron Stanford stepping in for Bruce Willis in the main role. Stanford stars as James Cole, a time traveler sent back to prevent the terroristic release of a virus that will kill the vast majority of the world's population. It's going to be tough to live up to the dark vision of the original movie, but the basic premise of 12 Monkeys offers more than enough story for a TV series to expand upon. UPDATE: 12 Monkeys proved divisive with critics, but SyFy was confident enough about the series' long-term appeal to order a second season, set to air sometime in 2016. 25. The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore (Comedy Central, January 19) Occupying the post-Daily Show slot once held by The Colbert Report, The Nightly Show promotes The Daily Show's longstanding \"Senior Black Correspondent\" to the host of his own series. It's safe to expect The Nightly Show to have a format similar to its sister series, but Wilmore is as distinctive and promising a host as Stephen Colbert was when The Colbert Report premiered in 2005. UPDATE: The Nightly Show still has some kinks to work out, but Wilmore has proven himself a worthy successor to Colbert — and with Jon Stewart scheduled to retire from The Daily Show, Comedy Central is lucky to have an experienced and reliable anchor for its sister show. 26. Justified (FX, January 20) The books and stories of Elmore Leonard have long been among Hollywood's favorite sources of adaptation — but there's never been anything as impressive as Justified, which successfully improves upon Leonard's original conception of U.S. marshal Raylan Givens, who appeared in several of his novels. Timothy Olyphant gets top billing, but he's equaled by Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder, a grandiose, speechifying criminal who serves as Raylan's greatest threat and occasional ally. This is Justified's final season, and the series — which has never been afraid of a high body count — is likely to go out with a bang. UPDATE: Justified's final season has been one of its all-time best — a twisty, top-notch crime story bringing many of the show's most beloved characters back for one last goodbye. The series ends on April 14. 27. The Americans (FX, January 28) FX's thrilling Cold War drama, often described as the best show nobody's watching, deserves every bit of critical acclaim that's been thrown at it. Real-life couple Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as a pair of deeply embedded Russian spies living as a married couple just outside of Washington, D.C. The Americans has the darkness and moral complexity to stand up alongside TV's best dramas, and the nail-biting tension of its twisty narrative only stands to increase in its third season. UPDATE: The Americans' ratings haven't improved, but its critical accolades have never been higher. No word on a fourth season yet; if you're not already watching, tune in to help save one of the great dramas of the past few years from getting prematurely canceled. 28. Fortitude (Pivot, January 29) You can't change the channel without finding a grim drama focused on a murder mystery, but there are promising signs that Fortitude will be a cut above your standard entry in the genre. Stanley Tucci stars as a detective who travels to a tiny Arctic community to solve a vicious and mysterious murder, leading a cast that also includes English acting luminaries like Michael Gambon and Christopher Eccleston. UPDATE: Fortitude is weirder and more sprawling than its initial episodes might have indicated, using both Stanley Tucci and the frozen setting to hypnotic effect. No word on a second season yet. 29. Better Call Saul (AMC, February 8) It's been more than a year since Walter White cooked his last batch of crystal meth, and AMC is returning to the world of Breaking Bad with Better Call Saul, a prequel series following the shady lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk in the original series. Messing with the history of a show as revered as Breaking Bad is a tricky prospect, but it's also an intriguing one — and while Walter White and Jesse Pinkman aren't slated to appear, viewers will be thrilled to see the return of fan-favorite character Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks). UPDATE: Better Call Saul doesn't have the relentless narrative momentum of Breaking Bad, and the overarching story feels unfocused, but Bob Odenkirk's lead performance is more than enough reason to tune in. The series is a huge hit, boasting the highest-rated premiere for a scripted series in cable history, and a second season will air in 2016. 30. The Walking Dead (AMC, February 8) Coming off a half-season that finally — finally — lived up to The Walking Dead's promise, the zombie drama returns for another batch of episodes following Rick Grimes and Co. Picking up after a tragic death in the midseason finale, the survivors continue their desperate trek to safety. UPDATE: The Walking Dead's latest season continues, like its titular zombies, to lurch right along. The show's massive success meant that AMC renewed it for a sixth season all the way back in October 2014; a spin-off, set in Los Angeles, is also on the way. 31. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix, March 6) Tina Fey co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which tells the story of a young woman (Ellie Kemper) who leaves a doomsday cult to start a new life in New York City. It's an offbeat premise for a sitcom, which is part of the reason that Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has had an unusually bumpy path to its premiere. The series was originally supposed to debut a 13-episode first season on NBC this spring, but in a complex series of maneuvers, the network ceded the sitcom to Netflix, which picked up two full seasons on the spot. Let's hope it's a better fit for Kimmy Schmidt, which always seemed a little too quirky for NBC primetime. UPDATE: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is terrific — hilarious, unique, and compulsively binge-watchable. Netflix hasn't set a premiere date for the second season, but it can't come soon enough. 32. Community (Yahoo! Screen, March 17) It is almost unbelievable that Community has survived to its sixth season. The cultishly adored sitcom, which follows an offbeat group of students attending a community college, has weathered storm after storm: perpetually low ratings, the firing of its showrunner, the re-hiring of its showrunner, and the departures of numerous cast members (including three who were there from the pilot). Community's latest hurdle came last year, with an outright cancelation from NBC. It seemed like fans would be denied their often-cited wish for #sixseasonsandamovie when a last-minute reprieve came from an unlikely source: Yahoo! Screen, a fledgling video service that acquired that exclusive rights to the show's sixth season. To make up for cast departures, the new season of Community will introduce several new characters, including two new regulars played by Paget Brewster and Keith David. UPDATE: The move to Yahoo! Screen hasn't changed the basic tone and style of Community — if you liked the show's previous seasons, you'll feel right at home here. No word on the show's long-term future, but it's hard to imagine the show going six seasons without getting its movie. 33. iZombie (The CW, March 27) Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas returns to The CW with an even less conventional take on the murder mystery. Rose McIver stars as Liv Moore, a coroner who happens to be a zombie (albeit one who's mostly in control of her cravings). Liv discovers that by eating the brains of the murder victims that pass through her office, she can partially recall their memories, enabling her to help in solving crimes. The zombie genre may be overstuffed, but iZombie is certainly a unique take on the material, and Veronica Mars has earned Rob Thomas more than enough goodwill to roll the dice on his latest project. UPDATE: Just one episode has aired, but iZombie is a charmer, pivoting a unique hook and a likable lead actress into a successful launch. We'll see if the series can hold onto its audience in the weeks to come. 34. Bloodline (Netflix, March 20) The creators of FX's Damages take their twisty sensibilities to Netflix for Bloodline, which chronicles the rift that develops in a family when its prodigal son returns. Details about the series have been scarce, but the top-notch cast — including Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, and Sissy Spacek — is more than enough to make Bloodline worth a look. UPDATE: Only the most dedicated viewers will have binge-watched all 13 episodes of the Netflix drama over the weekend of its premiere, but reviews have been largely positive (if not a little muted). No word on a second season yet.",
    "LabBody": "August 17, 2015. Every year, the TV landscape gets a little more crowded. There's never been a better time to be a TV viewer, but with so many options, it can also get a little overwhelming. Which TV shows are worth your time? Let The Week be your guide. Read through our list of the most promising shows of the season, and add a few new names to your DVR lineup. (We're only including shows with a set release date, and will update the list as other great shows nail down their premiere dates.) 1. Show Me a Hero (HBO, August 16) David Simon — best known as the creator of The Wire and Treme — returns to HBO once again for the miniseries Show Me a Hero, which offers a fictionalized take on a real-life public housing dispute that began in Yonkers, New York, in the late 1980s. The cast, which includes Oscar Isaac, Alfred Molina, and Winona Ryder, is terrific, and no one is as adept at mining highly politicized issues for drama as Simon is. 2. Blunt Talk (Starz, August 22) More than 20 years after Star Trek: The Next Generation finished its run, Patrick Stewart is finally returning to headline another American TV series. Stewart plays Walter Blunt, a newscaster forced to rebuild his credibility after he's arrested while driving drunk with a prostitute. Created by Jonathan Ames, who previously ran HBO's Bored to Death, Blunt Talk offers the same distinctive mix of debauchery and pathos. 3. Fear the Walking Dead (AMC, August 23) How much Walking Dead is too much Walking Dead? AMC is gambling that the massive, loyal audience that has turned the zombie series into cable's biggest hit will be hungry for this \"companion series,\" which tells an all-new story within the same universe. In addition to a new cast and a Los Angeles setting, Fear the Walking Dead will take place at the beginning of the zombie outbreak, giving fans greater insight into the societal collapse that was merely implied in the original series. 4. Narcos (Netflix, August 28) Netflix's latest original drama offers a fictionalized take on the rise of Pablo Escobar's Medellin drug cartel, as told from the perspective of both Escobar (Elite Squad's Wagner Moura) and a DEA agent tasked with capturing him (Game of Thrones' Pedro Pascal). The story of Escobar's rise and fall is as bloody and dramatic as anything you'd find in fiction, and the 10-episode series will have the opportunity to chronicle it in painstaking detail. 5. Drunk History (Comedy Central, September 1) Comedy Central's unique cocktail of alcohol, comedy, and history goes down as smoothly as anything on television. The concept is simple: Host Derek Waters invites comedians to recount their favorite stories from American history, while gently goading them into drinking as much as possible. Their sloshed ramblings are then performed as historical re-enactions by a cast of big-name actors and comedians. The upcoming third season will highlight American cities like Las Vegas and New Orleans. 6. You're the Worst (FXX, September 2) Hailed by many critics as the best sitcom of 2014 — and without question the raunchiest — You're the Worst follows a pair of self-absorbed Angelenos (Aya Cash and Chris Geere) who begin a tumultuous relationship after a one-night stand. You're the Worst has earned praise and a devoted group of viewers by fearlessly relying on the inherent likability of its two leads while depicting them at, well, their worst. 7. Late Show with Stephen Colbert (CBS, September 8) The longtime host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report takes over the late-night chair that was vacated by David Letterman in May. There are a lot of questions left to be answered about Colbert's move to mainstream late-night: How much will he break from Late Show's conventional format? And how will viewers respond to seeing Colbert outside of the \"Stephen Colbert\" character he played so successfully? But whatever form the new Late Show takes, Colbert is a quick-thinking and engaging entertainer, and it'll be a blast to have him in a regular TV slot again. 8. The Mindy Project (Hulu, September 15) To the great relief of its small but passionate group of fans, Hulu swooped in to save this perennially low-rated sitcom just a week after Fox cancelled it. Though The Mindy Project will now be a streaming-only series, creator and star Mindy Kaling has promised a relatively seamless transition: The all-new fourth season will consist of 26 episodes, parceled out once a week, just as they would be on a conventional network. 9. The Bastard Executioner (FX, September 15) FX takes a crack at its very own Game of Thrones with The Bastard Executioner, a medieval-themed series from Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter, starring newcomer Lee Jones as the titular knight-turned-executioner. Sutter has a well-earned reputation for excess, but his over-the-top style might well prove to be a perfect fit for this brutal, blood-drenched take on life in the 14th century. 10. Blindspot (NBC, September 21) NBC's new action/drama is as high-concept as it gets: A woman (Jaimie Alexander) wakes up nude, covered in tattoos, in the middle of Times Square, with no idea who she is or how she got there. Series creators Martin Gero and Greg Berlanti have invited comparisons to The Bourne Identity, which offered similar spy-fi thrills, and Alexander is a magnetic actress who's long overdue for a mainstream breakthrough. 11. The Muppets (ABC, September 22) After the terrific success of the 2011 film The Muppets (and the relative disappoint of its sequel, Muppets Most Wanted), the Muppets are heading back to primetime. The new TV series takes a novel approach to the familiar characters, aping the mockumentary style of The Office and Parks \u0026 Recreation to offer a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at the lives of Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and the rest. 12. Limitless (CBS, September 22) A kind of small-screen sequel to the 2011 thriller of the same name, Limitless stars American Sniper's James McDorman as a regular joe whose life is upended when he takes the miracle drug NZT, which allows its users to unlock the full potential of their brains. Bradley Cooper, who starred in the original Limitless, is slated to make occasional appearances, and the dumb-but-fun premise should offer a unique wrinkle on the well-worn genre. 13. black-ish (ABC, September 23) Kenya Barris' acclaimed sitcom, which follows a wealthy black family navigating the racial, cultural, and political lines of modern-day America, returns for a second season. There are few shows that tackle these issues in any way — let alone with so much humor — and black-ish's talented cast, which includes Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Laurence Fishburne, pulls it off with depth and style. 14. Empire (Fox, September 23) Terrence Howard leads the gleefully soapy Empire as Lucious Lyon, a hip-hop mogul who must decide how to dispose of his vast fortune when he's diagnosed with ALS. Riffing on both King Lear and The Lion in Winter, Empire proudly wears its serialized ambitions on its sleeve, from an unusually large cast for a network drama (including a scene-stealing role from Taraji P. Henson) to a series of new songs from Timbaland. The second season ups the count from 12 episodes to 18, offering even more chances to pile on soapy twists. 15. Heroes Reborn (NBC, September 24) After briefly capturing the zeitgeist with its buzzy first season in 2006, NBC's Heroes crashed hard with goofy, convoluted plotting and needlessly grim characters. But the core concept, which follows a group of people across the world who discover they have superpowers, is still compelling — and this 13-episode sequel series promises to return to the roots of what made Heroes such an out-of-the-box success in the first place. 16. The Last Man on Earth (Fox, September 27) Even the best sitcoms tend to obsess over the same basic subjects — work, friends, family, and dating. That's why the first season of The Last Man on Earth was such a breath of fresh air: By following Phil Miller (Will Forte), one of the only survivors of a post-apocalyptic event, the series grounded its character-driven comedy in a truly unique situation. The second season picks up where the first left off, as Phil contends with the irritations of daily life in an increasingly crowded post-apocalypse. 17. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah (Comedy Central, September 28) South African comedian Trevor Noah takes over the Daily Show anchor chair previously occupied by Jon Stewart — and given the cultish devotion Stewart amassed during his 16 years on The Daily Show, Noah has a big job ahead of him. The scrutiny brought on by the new gig has already led to controversy over Noah's old jokes, but it's not like Jon Stewart emerged fully-formed, either, and Noah's unique perspective on American culture offers plenty of opportunity for a fresh spin on The Daily Show's well-worn format. 18. The Grinder (Fox, September 29) In a meta tweak on his real-life persona, Rob Lowe stars in The Grinder as Dean Sanderson, an actor best known for playing a hotshot lawyer on a TV series titled The Grinder. When the series ends, Sanderson returns to his hometown and joins his family's actual law firm — to the chagrin of his lawyer brother Stewart (Fred Savage), whose actual legal career has been overshadowed by his famous brother's fictional one. 19. The Leftovers (HBO, October 4) HBO's polarizing drama — which takes place in a world reeling from a rapture-like event that saw the inexplicable disappearance of two percent of the world's population — returns for its sophomore run. Showrunner Damon Lindelof has promised a more streamlined and plot-driven second season, as the Garvey family heads to a Texas suburb that was inexplicably spared from the sudden disappearance of its citizens. 20. Homeland (Showtime, October 4) It's been a rough few years for Homeland, which has seen steady erosion from the massive critical acclaim of its first season after misguided creative choices and goofy plot twists. Still, Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin's performances remain as impressive as ever, and the new season — which jumps ahead two years and moves the story to Berlin — is a chance for a quasi-reboot that could bring Homeland back to previous glories. 21. iZombie (The CW, October 6) Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas' iZombie offers an even less conventional take on the murder mystery. Rose McIver stars as Liv Moore, a coroner who happens to be a zombie (albeit one who's mostly in control of her cravings). Liv discovers that by eating the brains of the murder victims that pass through her office, she can partially recall their memories, enabling her to help in solving crimes. The zombie genre may be overstuffed, but iZombie is one of the most unique and engaging evolutions yet. 22. Red Oaks (Amazon, October 9) Amazon's promising new comedy series riffs on the coming-of-age comedies of the '80s with the story of a college kid (Submarine's Craig Roberts) who spends his summer working at a country club in 1985. Directed by Pineapple Express' David Gordon Green and featuring talented, underutilized actors like Paul Reiser and Jennifer Grey, Red Oaks is one of the stronger pilots to emerge from Amazon's ongoing attempt to launch a full slate of original shows. 23. American Horror Story: Hotel (FX, October 10) Like pretty much anything by Glee creator Ryan Murphy, American Horror Story is maddeningly inconsistent — but even at its worst, there's nothing else that's quite like it. For its fifth season, Murphy has promised more actual horror than last year's campy Freak Show, with a slew of returning cast members and an extremely buzzy new role for Lady Gaga, playing the owner of the titular hotel. 24. The Walking Dead (AMC, October 11) The Walking Dead continues, like its titular zombies, to lurch right along; the show's massive ratings scored it a sixth-season renewal all the way back in October 2014. The new season will follow the survivors as they settle into Alexandria, a \"safe zone\" in Virginia, with new allies and enemies on the horizon. 25. Fargo (FX, October 12) For its second season, FX's terrific anthology drama rewinds the clock to 1979, delving into the \"Sioux Falls massacre\" that was briefly teased in conversation in season one. The all-new cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson, and Patrick Wilson, playing the younger version of the character originated by Keith Carradine in season one. 26. Manhattan (WGN America, October 13) Following a stellar first season, Manhattan — which follows the group of Los Alamos scientists tasked with building the atomic bomb at the height of World War II — returns for its sophomore season. Gorgeous, complex, and beautifully acted, this period drama cements WGN America as a go-to channel for fans of top-tier original dramas. 27. The Knick (Cinemax, October 16) Steven Soderbergh's eccentric period drama, which follows a brilliant surgeon (Clive Owen) at a New York hospital in 1900, returns for another year. Bleak, grisly, and brutal, The Knick can be a hard show to watch, but its exploration of a little-discussed time and place in American history remains darkly mesmerizing. 28. Supergirl (CBS, October 26) Superman's cousin Kara (Glee's Melissa Benoist) dons her own red cape in Supergirl. It would be an understatement to say that superheroes haven't always worked on the small screen, but Benoist is perfectly suited for the role, and creator Greg Berlanti — whose other shows include the CW's Arrow and The Flash — has certainly proven adept at this kind of material before. 29. Ash vs. Evil Dead (Starz, October 31) More than 20 years after Army of Darkness, Bruce Campbell picks up his boomstick again for Ash vs. Evil Dead, the first TV installment in Sam Raimi's beloved horror-comedy series. The presence of Raimi and Campbell — as well as the anything-goes approach offered by a premium network like Starz — offer more than enough reasons to watch, but Ash vs. Evil Dead also offers a pair of intriguing new sidekicks in Jill Marie Jones and Ray Santiago. 30. Flesh and Bone (Starz, November 8) Breaking Bad alum Moira Walley-Beckett launches her own series with Flesh and Bone, a harrowing drama set in the world of ballet. Relying on professional dancers like Irina Dvorovenko and Sascha Radetsky for maximum authenticity, Flesh and Bone promises to do for dancing ballet what Breaking Bad did for cooking meth. 31. Into the Badlands (AMC, November 15) With its premiere months away, AMC's martial arts drama is still largely shrouded in mystery — but the ambition and scope is certainly intriguing. Danny Wu stars as Sunny, a warrior escorting a young boy across dangerous territory, in a story loosely based on the 1592 novel Journey to the West, which is widely regarded as one of China's greatest novels. 32. The Man in the High Castle (Amazon, November 20) Amazon's bold and ambitious alternate history series, which is based on the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name, is set in a world where the Axis won World War II, dividing the United States into two large territories controlled by Germany and Japan. It's an unsettling, enormously elastic premise that allows for essentially infinite stories, exploring the full ramifications of a vastly different world. TV shows that have already premiered: (Our original previews for each of these shows were published earlier this year. We've left those curtain-raisers untouched, but appended updates to each item.) 33. Agent Carter (ABC, January 6) After successfully reinvigorating its sophomore drama Agents of S.H.I.E.LD., Marvel is delving into its past with the limited series Agent Carter. The story picks up in the mid-1940s, shortly after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, as Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) embarks on a series of top-secret missions while combating the sexism of the era. This is Marvel's first project centered on a female protagonist, and a look back at the events that set up for blockbusters like Iron Man and The Avengers should provide a fresh and intriguing take on the Marvel universe. UPDATE: Agent Carter's brief run was praised by fans and critics alike, and despite so-so ratings, ABC is bringing it back for a second season, to premiere in 2016. 34. Babylon (SundanceTV, January 8) Danny Boyle's dark satire follows an American public relations whiz (Brit Marling) hired to improve the sagging public image of London's Metropolitan Police Department. It's edgy, well-timed material, and the series wears its ambition on its sleeve, with a massive ensemble cast splitting perspectives between the PR team and the cops. UPDATE: Babylon was a solid performer in the U.K., but never caught on stateside. It will not return for a second season. 35. Girls (HBO, January 11) Girls' cultural footprint may be larger than its actual viewership, but there's still plenty to admire about Lena Dunham's unique depiction of life and love in your twenties. Season four takes a bold step by shifting the narrative away from Brooklyn, as Hannah Horvath (Dunham) begins a program at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. (Don't worry — the rest of the cast, including Adam Driver and Allison Williams, are staying put.) UPDATE: Girls' ratings have more or less plateaued — after four seasons, you probably know if you're a fan or not. The fourth season made bold choices by splitting up its protagonists into distinct narratives, and a flash-forward in the finale indicates that the schism will continue. The series will return for a fifth season in 2016. 36. Shameless (Showtime, January 11) For four seasons, Showtime's underappreciated dramedy has followed the ups and downs of the blue-collar Gallagher family, led by the deadbeat patriarch Frank (William H. Macy). Season five picks up shortly after Fiona (Emmy Rossum), the most responsible member of the family, is released from prison, getting back to life as usual as she sorts through her family's various dysfunctions. UPDATE: Shameless continues to quietly amass buzz and acclaim, with William H. Macy's lead performance winning a Screen Actors Guild Award in January. The series will return for a sixth season, to premiere in January 2016. 37. Togetherness (HBO, January 11) The Duplass brothers take their talents to television for this warm dramedy about a pair of middle-aged couples attempting to put their lives in order. Unlike most of what ends up on television, there's no big hook for Togetherness; just a group of genial actors, including Mark Duplass and Amanda Peet, digging into their likably messy characters as they navigate life in Los Angeles. UPDATE: As Togetherness unrolled its narrative, it got darker, culminating in a cliffhanger that threatens the future of its central couple. Fortunately, viewers won't need to wait too long for resolution, as the series has been renewed for a second season (though a premiere date hasn't been set). 38. Parks \u0026 Recreation (NBC, January 13) Following similarly beloved shows like 30 Rock and The Office into that good night, NBC's last truly brilliant sitcom ends its run with a final string of episodes that were teased in a flash-forward at the end of season six. Expect the show's final 13 episodes to serve as an extended love letter to the well-drawn characters and brilliant cast, from the relentlessly positive Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) to internet favorite Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) — as well as some intriguing new characters, like a hapless employee played by Jon Hamm. UPDATE: After seven seasons, Parks \u0026 Recreation ended its run with a string of terrific episodes, culminating in a series of flash-forwards revealing the ultimate fates of its characters. 39. Broad City (Comedy Central, January 14) Comedy Central's wonderfully loopy series returns for a second season, as Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson navigate the travails of living in New York in your twenties. Aside from its two enormously appealing leads, Broad City's brilliance is in its elasticity; the series has no problem diverting from reality for any number of fantastical asides, offering scene after scene full of hilarious and unexpected turns. UPDATE: Broad City was even stronger in its sophomore season, netting universally positive reviews and an ever-growing roster of devoted viewers. The series will return for a third season, set to premiere in 2016. 40. The Fall (Netflix, January 16) It's been a long, long wait to see the next chapter in the chilling serial killer drama, but The Fall is finally set to pick up at the end of the first season's cliffhanger. Gillian Anderson stars as a police inspector on the trail of a sociopathic killer (Jamie Dornan, soon to debut as Fifty Shades of Grey's Christian Grey). The entire second season drops on Netflix on January 16, so set your binge-watching schedules accordingly. UPDATE: The Fall's second season was a hit abroad, and Netflix's unquenchable thirst for exclusive programs means it will always have a home in the United States. The series will return for a third and final season, set to air sometime in 2016. 41. 12 Monkeys (Syfy, January 16) Nearly 20 years after its premiere, Terry Gilliam's cultishly beloved sci-fi movie makes its way to the small screen, with X-Men alum Aaron Stanford stepping in for Bruce Willis in the main role. Stanford stars as James Cole, a time traveler sent back to prevent the terroristic release of a virus that will kill the vast majority of the world's population. It's going to be tough to live up to the dark vision of the original movie, but the basic premise of 12 Monkeys offers more than enough story for a TV series to expand upon. UPDATE: 12 Monkeys proved divisive with critics, but SyFy was confident enough about the series' long-term appeal to order a second season, set to air sometime in 2016. 42. The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore (Comedy Central, January 19) Occupying the post-Daily Show slot once held by The Colbert Report, The Nightly Show promotes The Daily Show's longstanding \"Senior Black Correspondent\" to the host of his own series. It's safe to expect The Nightly Show to have a format similar to its sister series, but Wilmore is as distinctive and promising a host as Stephen Colbert was when The Colbert Report premiered in 2005. UPDATE: The Nightly Show still has some kinks to work out, but Wilmore has proven himself a worthy successor to Colbert — and with Jon Stewart retiring from The Daily Show, Comedy Central is lucky to have an experienced and reliable anchor for its sister show. 43. Justified (FX, January 20) The books and stories of Elmore Leonard have long been among Hollywood's favorite sources of adaptation — but there's never been anything as impressive as Justified, which successfully improves upon Leonard's original conception of U.S. marshal Raylan Givens, who appeared in several of his novels. Timothy Olyphant gets top billing, but he's equaled by Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder, a grandiose, speechifying criminal who serves as Raylan's greatest threat and occasional ally. This is Justified's final season, and the series — which has never been afraid of a high body count — is likely to go out with a bang. UPDATE: Justified's final season was one of its all-time best — a twisty, top-notch crime story bringing many of the show's most beloved characters back for one last goodbye. The series ended with a pitch-perfect finale on April 14, 2015. 44. The Americans (FX, January 28) FX's thrilling Cold War drama, often described as the best show nobody's watching, deserves every bit of critical acclaim that's been thrown at it. Real-life couple Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as a pair of deeply embedded Russian spies living as a married couple just outside of Washington, D.C. The Americans has the darkness and moral complexity to stand up alongside TV's best dramas, and the nail-biting tension of its twisty narrative only stands to increase in its third season. UPDATE: The Americans' ratings haven't improved, but its critical accolades have never been higher. The series will return for a fourth season in 2016. 45. Fortitude (Pivot, January 29) You can't change the channel without finding a grim drama focused on a murder mystery, but there are promising signs that Fortitude will be a cut above your standard entry in the genre. Stanley Tucci stars as a detective who travels to a tiny Arctic community to solve a vicious and mysterious murder, leading a cast that also includes English acting luminaries like Michael Gambon and Christopher Eccleston. UPDATE: Fortitude was weirder and more sprawling than its initial episodes might have indicated, using its frozen setting to hypnotic effect. A second season has been ordered, though no premiere date has been set. 46. Better Call Saul (AMC, February 8) It's been more than a year since Walter White cooked his last batch of crystal meth, and AMC is returning to the world of Breaking Bad with Better Call Saul, a prequel series following the shady lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk in the original series. Messing with the history of a show as revered as Breaking Bad is a tricky prospect, but it's also an intriguing one — and while Walter White and Jesse Pinkman aren't slated to appear, viewers will be thrilled to see the return of fan-favorite character Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks). UPDATE: Better Call Saul didn't have the relentless narrative momentum of Breaking Bad, and the overarching story felt unfocused, but Bob Odenkirk's lead performance was more than enough reason to tune in. The series is a huge hit, boasting the highest-rated premiere for a scripted series in cable history, and a second season will air in 2016. 47. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix, March 6) Tina Fey co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which tells the story of a young woman (Ellie Kemper) who leaves a doomsday cult to start a new life in New York City. It's an offbeat premise for a sitcom, which is part of the reason that Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has had an unusually bumpy path to its premiere. The series was originally supposed to debut a 13-episode first season on NBC this spring, but in a complex series of maneuvers, the network ceded the sitcom to Netflix, which picked up two full seasons on the spot. Let's hope it's a better fit for Kimmy Schmidt, which always seemed a little too quirky for NBC primetime. UPDATE: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was terrific — hilarious, unique, and compulsively binge-watchable. Netflix hasn't set a premiere date for the second season, but it can't come soon enough. 48. Community (Yahoo! Screen, March 17) It is almost unbelievable that Community has survived to its sixth season. The cultishly adored sitcom, which follows an offbeat group of students attending a community college, has weathered storm after storm: perpetually low ratings, the firing of its showrunner, the re-hiring of its showrunner, and the departures of numerous cast members (including three who were there from the pilot). Community's latest hurdle came last year, with an outright cancelation from NBC. It seemed like fans would be denied their often-cited wish for #sixseasonsandamovie when a last-minute reprieve came from an unlikely source: Yahoo! Screen, a fledgling video service that acquired that exclusive rights to the show's sixth season. To make up for cast departures, the new season of Community will introduce several new characters, including two new regulars played by Paget Brewster and Keith David. UPDATE: The move to Yahoo! Screen didn't change the basic tone and style of Community — if you liked the show's previous seasons, you'll like this too. The series won't return for a seventh season, but it's hard to imagine Community going six seasons without getting its movie. 49. Bloodline (Netflix, March 20) The creators of FX's Damages take their twisty sensibilities to Netflix for Bloodline, which chronicles the rift that develops in a family when its prodigal son returns. Details about the series have been scarce, but the top-notch cast — including Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, and Sissy Spacek — is more than enough to make Bloodline worth a look. UPDATE: Dedicated viewers who binge-watched all 13 episodes of the well-received Netflix drama will have another season to devour; Bloodline will return for a second outing in 2016. 50. Outlander (Starz, April 4) After several misbegotten stabs at period dramas, Starz scored with this buzzy adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's series of historical fantasy novels. Caitriona Balfe stars as a World War II combat nurse who travels back in time to Scotland's civil war in 1743. It might sound a little goofy, but Outlander sells the premise with style, leaping deftly from genre to genre for a story that's not quite like anything else on television. UPDATE: The back half of Outlander's first season didn't live up to the initial run of episodes, but the show's fans remain as loyal as ever. A second season has been ordered, though no premiere date has been set. 51. Wolf Hall (PBS, April 5) Hilary Mantel's brilliant novel about the court of King Henry VIII — told from the perspective of his often-maligned advisor Thomas Cromwell — gets a lavish small-screen adaptation. Tony-winning stage actor Mark Rylance stars as Cromwell, leading a cast that includes Homeland's Damian Lewis as King Henry. Wolf Hall's dense reappraisal of British history packs in all the political intrigue of Game of Thrones, and a faithful adaptation should prove no less addictive or hypnotic. UPDATE: Between a deep, talented cast and an intelligently streamlined take on the story, Wolf Hall offered a top-notch take on Mantel's novels. The only complaint is that the series spanned just six episodes. With any luck, when Mantel publishes her third and final Cromwell novel, The Mirror and the Light, Wolf Hall's cast will reassemble to complete the story. 52. Mad Men (AMC, April 5) What's left to be said about Mad Men? AMC's brilliant drama, which centers on a Manhattan advertising firm in the 1960s, has already secured its place among the great shows in television history. Last year's set of episodes, which made up the first half of Mad Men's final season, were some of the best in the show's entire run, and the show's sprawling ensemble cast is as deep (and uniformly excellent) as ever. With just seven episodes left, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to Mad Men, but that's no reason to miss a single second of the show's final hours. UPDATE: Mad Men's final batch of episodes didn't miss a step, offering a moving and fitting end to the show's many stories. And the instantly iconic final shot of Don Draper offered an intriguing kind of television Rorschach Test, ensuring that viewers will continue to debate Mad Men's ultimate message for years to come. 53. Louie (FX, April 9) A justified critical darling, Louie C.K.'s experimental sitcom is one of TV's most unpredictable shows; by playing freely with form and style, C.K. ensures that viewers never know what they're going to see when they tune in. With Louie C.K. serving as creator, writer, director, and star — as well as a host of other jobs — Louie is one of TV's few true auteur projects. Watching an episode is like getting a glimpse into the acerbic comedian's brain. UPDATE: Unfortunately, C.K.'s overstuffed schedule means that we many not get any more Louie for a while; though the series will eventually return for another season, C.K. has announced an indefinite hiatus while he focuses on other projects. 54. Daredevil (Netflix, April 10) Marvel extends its superheroic empire with the first of four Netflix-exclusive dramas. Charlie Cox stars as Daredevil, a blind superhero who fights crime using his enhanced other senses. (The remaining three shows — centered on Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage — will premiere later, with a miniseries combining all four characters to follow.) Daredevil has a fiercely loyal following among comics fans, but the first major adaptation of his story, which starred Ben Affleck, failed to connect with audiences in 2003. Since then, Marvel has essentially rewritten the book on superhero adaptations, and it's hard to imagine it will botch the opportunity to reintroduce a character with so much potential to mainstream audiences. UPDATE: Daredevil thrilled comic fans with a darker, tighter story than Marvel has ever told on the big screen. The second season, slated to premiere sometime in 2016, will up the ante by introducing The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal as fan-favorite antihero The Punisher. 55. Game of Thrones (HBO, April 12) Over four seasons, HBO's fantasy drama has achieved the kind of buzz most networks can only dream about, turning once-obscure phrases like \"Winter is Coming\" and \"Red Wedding\" into entrenched cultural catchphrases. Though many of the best moments from George R.R. Martin's novels have already occurred in the TV series, the fifth season of Game of Thrones is likely to be the most sprawling, with fan-favorite characters like Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark scattered across the world. TV shows rarely come more ambitious, or more compulsively watchable, than this. UPDATE: In its fifth season, Game of Thrones showed no signs of slowing down, ending on a brutal cliffhanger that has fans poring over set reports to try to guess its resolution. A sixth season will premiere in 2016. 56. Veep (HBO, April 12) Building on a third season that was easily the show's best, HBO's scathing political satire returns as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Selina Meyer — thrust into the nation's highest office after the unexpected resignation of the president — battles to keep her role in a contentious election. Veep is the ideal political satire for our time: hilarious, profane, and unfailingly committed to the idea that politicians on both sides of the aisle are petty, self-absorbed idiots. UPDATE: Veep's fourth season upped the stakes for every existing character while introducing some terrific new ones (played by actors like Patton Oswalt and Hugh Laurie). Veep will return for a fifth season, though creator Armando Ianucci has left the series. 57. Orphan Black (BBC America, April 18) The second season of Orphan Black was a step down from the addictive, propulsive first, but no matter how much it went off the rails, the sci-fi head-scratcher would be worth watching solely on the basis of its star. Over the course of the series, Tatiana Maslany has successfully played more than a dozen separate characters (all clones), and the third season adds a new adversary in a set of male clones (Ari Millen). UPDATE: Orphan Black is still pretty convoluted, but Maslany — finally nominated for a Best Actress Emmy — continues to anchor the series. A fourth season will premiere in 2016. 58. Happyish (Showtime, April 26) The genesis of Happyish is a sad story: the dramedy originally starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had already filmed the pilot before his sudden death. Those who have seen the originally Happyish pilot have testified to Hoffman's brilliance in the lead role, and while it's a shame that viewers will never get to see him in a recurring TV role, the new version of Happyish — which replaces Hoffman with Steve Coogan — still has plenty of promise. Happyish follows Thom Payne, a middle-aged ad executive who pushes back against a youth-driven culture as he staves off his own sense of irrelevance. UPDATE: Unfortunately, Happyish turned out to be a dud, held back by a smug and inconsistent tone despite the strong performances of its lead actors. Showtime cancelled the series after single season. 59. Penny Dreadful (Showtime, May 3) Forget Homeland and The Affair — the best series on Showtime is Penny Dreadful. This wonderfully morbid period horror-drama packs in all the best elements of gothic fiction: ornate dialogue, gorgeous locales, a lavish orchestral score, and a never-ending stream of creepy, otherworldly creatures to tempt our heroes into succumbing to their darker sides. Anchored by an unmissable performance from Eva Green and an impressive comeback role for Josh Hartnett, Penny Dreadful is TV's most compelling horror show. UPDATE: True to form, Penny Dreadful returned in all its bloody, gonzo glory, with a terrifying villain to match (Helen McRory). The series will return for a third season, though no premiere date has been set. 60. Wayward Pines (Fox, May 14) M. Night Shyamalan's offbeat thriller series is so clearly inspired by Twin Peaks that it almost borders on plagiarism — but if you're going to crib, you might as well crib from the best. Matt Dillon stars as a Secret Service agent sent to investigate the disappearance of two fellow agents in a small Idaho town, only to discover that the entire town is a bizarre slice of Americana filled with strange secrets. Based on Shyamalan's recent pedigree and the ludicrous teaser video, Wayward Pines could easily turn out to be a fiasco — but it definitely doesn't look boring. UPDATE: Wayward Pines turned out to be bonkers — but if bonkers was what you were looking for, it certainly delivered. No further installments have been announced, 61. Hannibal (NBC, June 4) Bryan Fuller's arty, gory take on the fictional killer is one of network TV's most unjustly overlooked dramas: gorgeous, strange, and embedded with a tense psychological depth. As Hannibal, Mads Mikkelsen is good enough to make you forget about Anthony Hopkins, and Hugh Dancy is every bit his equal as Will Graham, the troubled FBI profiler whose pursuit of Hannibal brought him to the brink of insanity. UPDATE: Despite a third season that brought Hannibal to new and terrifying heights, NBC has pulled the plug on the series. If you're behind, catch up and enjoy it while we still have it. 62. Sense8 (Netflix, June 5) The Wachowskis have never equaled the towering, genre-expanding success of The Matrix, but no one can deny the ambition of their follow-up projects. Sense8, their first TV series (in a partnership with Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski), follows eight strangers from across the world who suddenly, inexplicably become mentally and emotionally linked. UPDATE: Sense8 was extremely uneven, but it's hard to be overly frustrated by any series that works this hard to break from TV norms. A second season has been ordered, though no premiere date has been set. 63. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (Netflix, July 31) The cultishly adored comedic film — which follows a group of counselors through a surreal series of misadventures at a summer camp — is finally getting its long-discussed prequel in the form of a Netflix limited series. Impressively, the series has managed to assemble pretty much everybody from the movie's insanely stacked cast, including Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Paul Rudd, and Elizabeth Banks. UPDATE: Wet Hot American Summer was an absolute blast — a silly, uber-watchable series that perfectly matched the tone of the movie while introducing a series of new revelations that make it even more fun to watch. No word on another season, and the schedules of the cast might make one impossible — but fans should be thrilled they got this one. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.",

    "DiffbotBody": "There’s no way to sugar coat it – discovering that your significant other has been unfaithful is the emotional equivalent of being waterboarded with Sriracha sauce… after a glycolic peel. Nevertheless, many of us have experienced the torture of infidelity and lived to tell the tale. And after the wounds have healed, sometimes these tales can make for one hell of a story. These individuals on Reddit shared their candid, no-holds-barred accounts in response to the question “How did you find out your S.O. was cheating?” Some of them made us chuckle, some of them made us cringe, and many of them left us wondering, “Wow, are people actually that dumb?” Honestly, folks, you can’t make this stuff up. 1. The ballsy sexter Glanced down and saw his phone. He was texting for nudes while I was sitting right next to him. So that was fun. 2. The Insta-idiot An Instagram picture of her kissing another guy. She obviously didn’t really think that one through. 3. The Facebook flimflam She had a number of alternate Facebook pages under pseudonyms. One day, one of them showed up on my “suggested friends” and I said “Hey, this girl looks a lot like SO.” So, I looked at it. Sure enough, it was her, and she had an active relationship going on with someone else. I later found two more of these pages. 4. The total life fuckover I was driving across country to move. He had moved ahead of us and he chose to wait until we were 600 miles from home, about halfway there. This was after I had resigned my job, given up our apartment, packed a U-Haul (that my mom and dad were driving), and become certified to teach in another state. I had the dog, cat, two mice and my child in my car. We turned around and went back after he told me. He left me with an incredible amount of debt and a great deal of heartache. 5. The guy who found the silver lining Googled her gmail username, just for shits and giggles, and found her profile (with photos) on a “mutual arrangement” ass-for-cash website. On the bright side, she was rated 4-stars in her reviews, so at least I picked decent ass. 6. The telltale pubes His pubes were trimmed. 7. The Oral-B revenge When I went to visit her at college, there was another toothbrush and guy’s clothes that weren’t mine. Once my suspicions were confirmed, said toothbrush was used to itch my balls. 8. The muff dive surprise My best friend dated this girl for over a year when we were teenagers and he found out she was cheating because when he went to go down on her, there was a condom in her vagina. 9. The longest flight ever Just got on a flight in London headed to Vegas. Sitting next to my GF and she wants to show me something she has planned for the trip so gets out her phone. It opens to the Messages and shows a chat with a guy (I know him) saying how much she is gonna miss him and how she doesn’t wanna go away with me anyway. The doors close on the plane and that was a really fucking fun 10-11 hrs… 10. The suspicious pee Started burning when I peed. We were about to buy a house too, had the down payment and preapproval and had found a nice place with a great roof deck and view of the city. 11. The one-sided open relationship Came home early from work and walked in on it. Yep, that’s about as cliché as it gets, but there you go. Funny thing is, I had wanted an open relationship, but he said that he couldn’t deal with that. Turns out he was just selfish. 12. The honeymoon from hell I snooped through his texts. He saw an escort a month before our wedding and texted her for another meetup during our honeymoon! …yup 13. The toilet seat tip-off Came home from working a double shift and found the toilet seat up. Either my wife didn’t take a piss for 20 hours straight or there had been another man in my house… We divorced shortly after. She ended up marrying this guy…then cheated on him…and now they are divorced. Didn’t feel bad for him at all. 14. The status swap He changed his Facebook status from “In a relationship” with me to “In a relationship” with her. 15. The straight-up, motherfucking asshole I was home recovering from two major back surgeries and one afternoon while taking a nap with our daughter I got up and walked in the office to see what he was doing. He minimized his browser and jumped so I knew something was up. I reopened his browser and it was websites for cheating spouses. His excuse, well we weren’t having sex, he needed to get it somewhere. 16. The math genius Found out via Facebook a few months after I had broken up with him. I was still friends with his siblings and parents, and they were tagged in some photos of him. Holding his clearly to term newborn son. Less than nine months after I broke up with him. 17. The sex tape scandal that was wrong on all levels Found a video in his phone of him fucking a whore from craigslist with a cheap dildo. Worst day of my life.",

The 50-year-old Castronovo will have to wear an ankle monitoring device and go directly to drug treatment when he is released from jail next week, a Marion County judge ruled at a court hearing Friday. Castronovo, who has backed the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Rodgers and John Waite, apologized in court and admitted he was a drug addict whose pattern of abuse cost him everything, KATU reported. \"Loss of my job. Loss of my freedom,\" Castronovo said in court. \"Probably the hardest thing that I'm dealing with now is the loss of a woman I felt I was going to spend the rest of my life wife,\" he said. Journey will play 16 tour dates in Canada over the next month without Castronovo, a veteran of five Journey albums since 2001. Castronovo has been with the band since 1998, when he replaced Steve Smith. He was arrested June 14 on misdemeanor assault and menacing, then released on bail and ordered not to contact the alleged victim. A grand jury later returned more serious charges, including rape. Castronovo was jailed again after authorities said he called and texted the woman with messages that included suicide threats and apologies. Judge Thomas Hart said Friday the phone messages Castronovo left for his alleged victim - 144 in all - were \"vile.\" The judge set bail at $200,000. Castronovo's attorney expects him to remain in treatment until his trial in October. With News Wire Services Journey drummer Deen Castronovo charged with wife's rape Journey drummer donates $10K to Ore. school wrecked by fire The suspected gangster behind the \"senseless murder\" of a 7-year-old watching July 4th fireworks on a Chicago street was arrested Wednesday more than 400 miles away in Wisconsin. Rasheed Martin, 20, was taken into custody by local police and sheriff's deputies without incident at an apartment complex in Superior, Wis., after a murder warrant was issued Friday, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said. Martin has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Amari Brown, who was in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood when Martin allegedly struck the child in a gang-related drive-by shooting. The intended target was Brown's father, Antonio Brown, who police called a ranking gang member in the Four Corner Hustlers. \"Baby Amari was not a gang leader,\" Rev. Ira Acree told NBC Chicago at the boy's funeral on Sunday. \"So we must do all we can to get the killer off the streets.\" Antonio Brown, who police said had a rap sheet that included 45 arrests, raced his son to the hospital, clutching him in the back seat of a car. The boy, shot in the chest, couldn't be saved. Amari was one of three killed and 27 wounded in a violent July 4 night in Chicago, The Chicago Tribune reported. \"Quite frankly, he should not have been on the street. This is exactly what the men and women of Chicago (police) are up against,\" Chicago Police Chief Garry McCarthy afterward. \"I'm angry, I'm frustrated that we're here again talking about a senseless murder. This has got to stop.\" Brown has been out on $50,000 bail since an April arrest on a gun charge, police said. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Grapes around the North Coast are slowly turning color as a precursor to this year’s harvest, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual and deliver a smaller crop than last year. Vineyard managers in Sonoma and Napa counties report that they have seen signs of veraison — the French term for the onset of the visual signs of ripening in grapes. During the process, which begins the countdown to harvest, red grapes turn from green to red and a purplish hue while white grapes go from green to a golden yellow. Local farmers said this year’s crop is maturing anywhere from 10 days to two weeks earlier than typical, similar to last year’s timeline, which resulted in the earliest harvest on the North Coast in a decade. Harvest is on track to start in mid-August, though fruit destined for sparkling wines will begin coming off the vines in late July or early August. In fact, growers feared harvest would occur even sooner this year following a mild winter that triggered an unusually early bud break, when the vineyards awaken from their winter slumber. Most vines finished bud break in February, more than a month earlier than normal. However, cool weather in May slowed down flowering and fruit set, when small flowers on the vines are fertilized and transformed into tiny grapes. Typically, this stage can last from 10 to 14 days. This year, it stretched out as long as four weeks in some cases, growers said. As a result, growers expect the size of the Sonoma County grape crop will decline for the second straight year from the record-breaking 2013 harvest. Last year, growers hauled in 255,635 tons of grapes, valued at $593 million. “We saw a long bloom because of a cool May,” said Ryan Decker, wine grower relations manager for Rodney Strong Vineyards in Healdsburg. “The main effect is you will see a reduced berry set, which is going to reduce yield a little bit, which is what we are seeing. … It’s just a little under the long-term average.” Barry Hoffner, owner of Silverwood Ranch in the Pine Mountain/Cloverdale Peak area that borders Sonoma and Mendocino counties, thinks his crop will be 15 to 20 percent smaller than last year on the 40 acres of mountain vineyards he owns and leases. “I don’t think it is going to affect the quality,” Hoffner said. Growers are monitoring their grapes to spot signs of unevenness among fruit that is ripening slower than other clusters because of the long flowering period, likely forcing them to thin some of the crop this year. comments powered by Disqus",

Growers are monitoring their grapes to spot signs of unevenness among fruit that is ripening slower than other clusters because of the long flowering period, likely forcing them to thin some of the crop this year. “Our primary goal is uniformity,” said P.J. Alviso, director of estate viticulture at Duckhorn Wine Co., which has 600 acres on the North Coast from the Napa Valley to the Russian River Valley. In some cases, Decker noted, it may be worth picking some less-ripe fruit if it is on a vine that contains other clusters that are more advanced, as the flavors could balance each other out. Growers have been lucky this year with temperate weather so far, especially because there have not been many heat spikes this summer. As a result, growers have been able to reduce the amount of water they normally use to irrigate vineyards. The amount of water used by the wine industry has come under increasing scrutiny with California in its fourth year of drought. This week’s rains also will help. Hoffner said they would allow him to hold off watering some of his vines until August. At Rodney Strong, Decker said, workers are only using only 4-6 gallons of water per vine on a weekly basis as opposed to the average of 8-10 gallons. The company has about 1,150 acres. The wine company has adopted new technology to help it reduce its water consumption, using a device that measures “evapotranspiration,” which is essentially the amount of moisture released by the vines into the air. That device, combined with soil moisture monitors, allows Decker and his crew to keep tabs on how much water to apply. “It gives us (in) gallons of water how much each vine is using per week,” he said. “We have been tracking a little bit lower as far as water use because it has been a little bit cooler to this point.” Alviso agreed, noting that Duckhorn has been using roughly 4-8 gallons per vine. “I have been amazed how much moisture the vines had early in the season,” he said. “We have irrigated very minimally.” Both men said they anticipate the clusters of grapes will enjoy a longer “hang time” between veraison and harvest this year, giving the fruit greater depth and complexity. “Any time we can extend that window from veraison to harvest, the wine quality is always going to be better,” Decker said. Though the yield this year appears not to be as large as in 2014, which was part of three large consecutive harvests, it should be more near average, which will come as a relief for most vintners given the large supply of unsold wine on the bulk market. The Ciatti Co., a San Rafael wine broker, notes in its June update that the California bulk wine market remains sluggish, adding that “large volumes remain of both red and white varietals from the 2012 and 2013 vintages.” Steve Sangiacomo, a partner of Sangiacomo Family Vineyards, said it was “a little relief” to have a smaller yield, given there had been some anxiety among growers at the prospects of having a fourth consecutive large crop. “We want to find that happy medium,” he said.

    "DiffbotBody": "Microsoft’s ambitious HoloLens project has generated a huge amount of interest of late, and for good reason. Who doesn’t love the idea of viewing and interacting with 3D holograms brought to life right in front of your eyes? The applications for entertainment and gaming are off the charts, but the implications for augmented reality in education and science are also undoubtedly massive. And now, Microsoft has teamed up with Case Western University in the US to show us what this might look like in an actual human anatomy class video demonstration. Human anatomy has been taught via two-dimensional representations of body parts for centuries, and even though in more recent times computer software has introduced various kinds of pseudo–3D anatomical models on 2D displays, none of these can rival the interactive holograms that HoloLens is capable of projecting (to the viewer’s eyes, at least). “With HoloLens, you can see the muscles on top of the skeleton, all at the same time. You can bring them in and out, and exactly understand where things sit,” says Mark Griswold, from the university’s radiology department. “You can take any anatomical part and show any of it,” adds Satyam Ghodasara, a medical student studying at the university. “You can move it around, you can make it kind of translucent so you can see through the outside, and that really helped me understand how cardiac anatomy worked.” The holograms will also enable anatomy and medicine students to learn things they wouldn’t be able to learn from studying living people. Bodily organs can be viewed and interacted with in isolation from other parts of the body, helping students to learn how they look and function. And importantly, if something goes wrong in a medical simulation, nobody gets hurt. Not that HoloLens only has eyes on the sciences. The video suggests that subjects like anthropology and art history could stand to benefit from HoloLens-based lessons, but really, any academic course featuring strong visual concepts may be suitable. Microsoft has been careful to show this time that holograms only appear in a limited portion of the wearer’s vision, addressing a minor controversy over the field of view the HoloLens visor offers to the user. In previous videos, the company seemed to imply that the 3D hologram depictions would fill the wearer’s whole field of vision, which caused a few ripples when some early testers pointed out that the effect was confined to a virtual window in front of them.

    "DiffbotBody": "At Sony’s press conference at E32015, President of Sony’s Worldwide Studios Shuhei Yoshida unveiled what to some, the announcement of this year’s E3 - that The Last Guardian is very much alive and is set for release in the near future. Having first started the development of the game in 2007 followed by its unveiling at E3 2009, it's been an eight-year journey of ups and downs for Sony with The Last Guardian coming into E3 2015. Explaining some of the issues faced which led to the eight-year delay, Shuhei said “The demo (The Last Guardian) shown (in 2009) was (taken) straight from the dev kit; running on the engine but it wasn’t running up to speed as shown in the video. The game was running on lower frame rate but we captured them frame by frame and sped it up for the 20-second video, fully expecting the final game to eventually run on the desired speed.\" He went on to explain that the development team then spent a lot of time optimising (the game) after that but were unable to get it to run on the required performance. Obviously frustrated with the slow progress (development) of the game, the team met and tried to develop it on the more powerful PS3 but still were unable to create a game they envisioned from the start. “It was clear that we have to compromise on the vision of the project in terms of scope, size of the levels or number of characters to continue on PS3” Shuhei added. It was later in 2012 when they decided to put it on ice and aim for the game’s development on Sony’s next console which came to be the PlayStation 4. “We were not sure if we were able to finish the game on the PS3 and even if we did, we knew that we would have to cut corners to make it run on the PS3”. A fully working demo of The Last Guardian was shown at the E32015 Sony Press Conference last week and is slated to release next year. For more news on The Last Guardian as well as bits from our discussion with Shuhei Yoshida at E3, stay tuned to IGN.

Read More [Editor’s Note: Be sure to join IGN and Harmonix for the world gameplay premiere of Rock Band 4 in our live stream on Friday, May 15 at 12pm PT/3pm ET/7pm GMT. That's 5am AEST on Saturday.] Many would agree that Rock Band 2 was the peak of Rock Band’s campaign design. Rock Band 4 aims to outperform the 2008 game’s limited story elements and band interaction with a simple, strong new feature: Gigs. “A gig is a new structure that we’ve put into Rock Band 4 to sort of capture the feeling of a live performance,” Lead Designer Chris Foster told IGN. It’s also an incredible way to have an extra layer of fun, or cause tension with, the people you’re playing with. Here’s hoping Rock Band 4 doesn’t cause any band breakups. You'll 'as a band' be able to vote on a setlist. Foster explained that the act of performing live music isn’t represented completely accurately in previous Rock Band games. You don’t hop on stage, play a song, and leave. “It’s sort of the ebb and flow of the arc of a performance over successive songs. So, like, the crowd coming with you, or potentially you needing to win them over…it’s a sense of momentum and pacing. So what we wanted to do with this is capture the sense of a gig and use it for narrative means, for new gameplay and emotional experiences within the Rock Band framework.” Essentially, Gigs operate similar to older games’ Setlists, or Rock Band 3’s Challenges. “It’s a series of songs subdivided into a series of sets with set breaks,” said Foster. A Gig we played involved four songs in two sets of two. A set break between each duo had stuff we’ve never seen in Rock Band before. “If you’re the vocalist, you’re able to perform a sort of stage patter…it’s sort of like adding some LARPing to your Rock Band experience,” Foster said. “You’re sort of role-playing a different event that is sort of happening offstage, or got you to the show in the first place inside the campaign, we’re using them to deliver the narrative experience.” So what does that mean, gameplay-wise? “They need to be really fun to play,” Foster said. “Particularly as the crowd is reacting. So, you’ll do your crowd work as a vocalist, the band will play a couple of songs, and then you’ll take another break. And in those breaks, you’ll be able to do a lot of voting. In some cases, there’ll be a set list that is predefined, like in previous Rock Bands. But in other cases, you’ll – as a band – be able to vote on a setlist.” Choices appear between sets, drawn from your music library and the gig’s theme/genre. Bandmates have a limited time to choose the song they all wish to play -- which could lead to interesting, awkward interactions with you band. Your guitarist may decide on a spectacular, fun song the vocalist doesn’t know, or can’t sing to properly. An exhausted drummer can vote for something laid-back, while the rest of his bandmates troll her with a gnarly drum solo track. “It becomes a really interesting collaborative and competitive experience, as you’ll have people say what they want and what they absolutely don’t want,” Foster said. “It’s fun, because when you’re beat-matching, it’s tunnel vision; you’re focused on your instrument, you’re barely aware of other people if they’re falling out or if you can save them. But the moments between songs, we’re able to come up with these other game experiences, and they can be really fun.” Fighting or messing with your band isn’t necessarily to your advantage of course. You can carry over your multipliers and Overdrive power between songs during gigs, adding a small but interesting extra layer of strategy that can affect your band’s score. Gigs can be played for kicks in a party setting, for sure, but they’re also core to Rock Band 4’s campaign -- which involves an interesting branching narrative similar to an RPG. We’ll have more on that for you later this month.

    "LabBody": "At Sony’s press conference at E32015, President of Sony’s Worldwide Studios Shuhei Yoshida unveiled what to some, the announcement of this year’s E3 - that The Last Guardian is very much alive and is set for release in the near future. Having first started the development of the game in 2007 followed by its unveiling at E3 2009, it's been an eight-year journey of ups and downs for Sony with The Last Guardian coming into E3 2015. Explaining some of the issues faced which led to the eight-year delay, Shuhei said “The demo (The Last Guardian) shown (in 2009) was (taken) straight from the dev kit; running on the engine but it wasn’t running up to speed as shown in the video. The game was running on lower frame rate but we captured them frame by frame and sped it up for the 20-second video, fully expecting the final game to eventually run on the desired speed.\" He went on to explain that the development team then spent a lot of time optimising (the game) after that but were unable to get it to run on the required performance. Obviously frustrated with the slow progress (development) of the game, the team met and tried to develop it on the more powerful PS3 but still were unable to create a game they envisioned from the start. “It was clear that we have to compromise on the vision of the project in terms of scope, size of the levels or number of characters to continue on PS3” Shuhei added. It was later in 2012 when they decided to put it on ice and aim for the game’s development on Sony’s next console which came to be the PlayStation 4. “We were not sure if we were able to finish the game on the PS3 and even if we did, we knew that we would have to cut corners to make it run on the PS3”. A fully working demo of The Last Guardian was shown at the E32015 Sony Press Conference last week and is slated to release next year. For more news on The Last Guardian as well as bits from our discussion with Shuhei Yoshida at E3, stay tuned to IGN.",

    "DiffbotBody": "If Sandra Pupatello attempted a political comeback in her old riding of Windsor West, she would give New Democrat MP Brian Masse “a run for his money,” according to a new opinion poll. With a federal election expected in the fall, Pupatello has said she has not “closed the door” on a return to political life. The poll, commissioned for The Windsor Star, indicated that Masse, who has held a firm grip on the riding since 2002, would face a “heavyweight title fight” if the Liberals recruited Pupatello. “Masse is a very well-liked, respected, long-serving MP,” said Quito Maggi, CEO of Mainstreet Research, a Toronto-based polling firm. “But, what it boils down to is everybody has a shelf life, and maybe he’s reached his.” The survey, conducted Wednesday, presented two hypothetical races which included Pupatello and Windsor Mayor Eddie Francis running as Liberal candidates against Masse. The results showed that both Pupatello and Francis would give Masse “a run for his money,” said Maggi. The survey asked: “If the following candidates ran who would you vote for if an election were held today?” Among the candidates listed in both scenarios were Lisa Lumley for the Conservatives and Alishia Fox for the Green Party; both ran unsuccessfully against Masse in 2011. In the scenario that included a Pupatello Liberal candidacy, 35 per cent of respondents said they would vote NDP, 33 per cent Liberal, 19 per cent Progressive Conservative and two per cent Green Party, while 11 per cent were undecided. With a Francis candidacy, 35 per cent said they would vote NDP, 34 per cent Liberal, 18 per cent Conservative and three per cent Green, while 10 per cent were undecided. In the 2011 campaign, Masse walked away with 54.33 per cent of the vote, far ahead of Lumley who garnered 31.64 per cent. Liberal candidate Melanie Deveau was a distant third with 10.99 per cent of the vote. The automated telephone poll conducted Wednesday garnered responses from 581 people. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.97 per cent, 19 times out of 20. Francis, currently vice-president of operations at the Windsor Family Credit Union, ruled out a return to politics. “I’m flattered, I’m humbled, I’ve appreciated the support of the community throughout my tenure, but I decided to get out of politics. I’m very happy in my new life.” Windsor’s three-term mayor did point out, however, that the polling results suggest he would be more likely than Pupatello to pull support away from the Conservative party. “I don’t want to read anything into it, but Sandra would not get Conservative supporters. She’s a staunch Liberal. If I ran as a Liberal I would get some of Lumley’s numbers.” While she refused comment, Pupatello should be encouraged by the results, said Maggi. “It would be really interesting, and turn Windsor West into one of the battlegrounds to watch in the election in Ontario and across the country,” he said. Pupatello held Windsor West for the Ontario Liberals from 1995 to 2011, including eight years as a cabinet minister. Her resignation Monday as CEO of the WindsorEssex Economic Development Corporation could pave the way toward a bid to unseat Masse in a fall election. Cheryl Collier, a political scientist at the University of Windsor, said the poll suggests Pupatello’s brand has not been severely tarnished by recent criticism of her performance at the economic development corporation. “She’s had some negative coverage, but she still polls high,” said Collier, who expressed doubt that the poll’s results would be enough to convince Pupatello to throw her hat back in the ring. “I think she’s more interested in the Liberal Party and how they’re doing nationally.” Collier also cautioned it is too early to make predictions about a campaign that has not officially started. “It’s a hypothetical poll, way before an election campaign, so we have to be very careful about what we read into this,” she said. “In the summer months, people don’t pay attention. What you’re seeing (from the results) are the core supporters for the party brand.” But Dave Sundin, president of Windsor West Liberal Riding Association, said the percentage of undecided voters suggests Masse would be vulnerable against a strong candidate. Masse “isn’t as unbeatable as everyone thinks he is,” said Sundin. “With that level of undecided voters, the election would easily swing in the Liberals’ favour.” Masse dismissed the poll, saying that only one that matters is election day. “A poll is a snapshot of any given day. I don’t really get into them,” he said. “And that’s why I’ve never even commissioned any polls during my political career. So my job is to work during the election to earn every single vote and to respect the opinion of the electorate.” Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have nominated candidates in Windsor West, which suggests the parties view Masse as unbeatable, said Collier. But spokesmen for the two parties said they were taking the time necessary to field the best possible candidates. Al Teshuba, chair of the search and nominating committee for the Windsor West Conservative riding association, said the Mainstreet poll mirrors results of a poll the party conducted in the riding about two weeks ago. The Tory poll gave the NDP a base support of 35 per cent, although the undecided vote was at 20 per cent, he said. “The undecided votes will determine the winner of this election,” said Teshuba. “Those are people who are waiting to hear the issues. That’s as it should be — a full campaign with many debates so people can make an informed decision.” Of the undecided voters in the Mainstreet survey, 32 per cent said they were leaning toward the New Democrats, while 25 per cent were eying the Liberals — a trend that clearly favours Masse, said Lydia Miljan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Windsor. “The leaners are going toward the NDP instead of the Liberals,” said Miljan. “I don’t think it makes the case for either Pupatello or Eddie. They have other day jobs and have stepped away from politics. These numbers suggest it would not be in their interests to get back into it. It’d be a lot of work, and there’s a great potential that their efforts would not succeed.” One of Masse’s biggest assets: his get-out-the-vote team, she added. “”I still think he would win with a good margin in a general election.” We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

    "DiffbotBody": "Taking down the Confederate flag flown on government property is something we should have done a while back. The key here is flags flown on government property. It’s an easy call for us libertarians, since we don’t believe government should even have property. The Democrats, the party of hollow symbolic gestures, had a rare win (in their minds) last week when South Carolina removed the Confederate battle flag flown on the grounds of the state capital, and which was put there by Democrat icon Sen. “Fritz” Hollings. Liberals are always just one empty gesture away from solving any problem they conjure up. Every four years, S.C. is voted by the Electoral College as “Most Likely to Secede.” Now the flag is gone and, finally, our racial issues are behind us. Like getting rid of that last pair of pleated pants in the closet, we knew we had to do it. We just needed a reason. In truth, liberal democrats didn’t take that flag down. Nor did South Carolina do it because Taylor Swift said to. The reaction by the people of Charleston to the horrific shooting in the AME Church brought the flag down. They acted with dignity, reason, grace and love. They didn’t let race merchants like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson take over. We should be proud of the South and the way Charleston handled the tragedy. We southerners do not like arrogant, elitist liberals in high-tax, decaying, northern cities telling us what to do. We like it here. You never hear anyone say, “Hey we are retiring and moving north.” Notice that non-issues erupt in devastating riots, looting and harm in communities like Ferguson and Baltimore in the Democrat-controlled North.

    "LabBody": "Taking down the Confederate flag flown on government property is something we should have done a while back. The key here is flags flown on government property. It’s an easy call for us libertarians, since we don’t believe government should even have property. The Democrats, the party of hollow symbolic gestures, had a rare win (in their minds) last week when South Carolina removed the Confederate battle flag flown on the grounds of the state capital, and which was put there by Democrat icon Sen. “Fritz” Hollings. Liberals are always just one empty gesture away from solving any problem they conjure up. Every four years, S.C. is voted by the Electoral College as “Most Likely to Secede.” Now the flag is gone and, finally, our racial issues are behind us. Like getting rid of that last pair of pleated pants in the closet, we knew we had to do it. We just needed a reason. In truth, liberal democrats didn’t take that flag down. Nor did South Carolina do it because Taylor Swift said to. The reaction by the people of Charleston to the horrific shooting in the AME Church brought the flag down. They acted with dignity, reason, grace and love. They didn’t let race merchants like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson take over. We should be proud of the South and the way Charleston handled the tragedy. We southerners do not like arrogant, elitist liberals in high-tax, decaying, northern cities telling us what to do. We like it here. You never hear anyone say, “Hey we are retiring and moving north.” Notice that non-issues erupt in devastating riots, looting and harm in communities like Ferguson and Baltimore in the Democrat-controlled North. Property values are down 35% in Ferguson and shootings have skyrocketed in Baltimore. A Democrat reaction to a problem is usually the start of a new problem. Each racially tinged occurrence does not mean you can loot a big screen TV; that is not what Dr. King had in mind. Democrats always seize on tragedy to blame, bloviate and demand more gun laws.

She said, “I won’t take this tacky, over-the-top thing off my head until Donald Trump is willing to do the same.” Even private businesses cave to media pressure. Disney ordered a statue of Bill Cosby removed from one of its theme parks because it cost the company a lot to have to pull the Bill Cosby statue off Sleeping Beauty all the time. Totalitarian regimes like ISIS and North Korea seek to re-write their history, not America. Where does it end? Where do free speech and the speech police settle this? The Democrat Party, recently led by Klan organizer Sen. Robert Byrd, need not lecture the South on race. He used the “N” word and rose to power, and he always applauded at the wrong times in Gone With the Wind. The North has a lot more issues than the South. We differ in so many ways, more so today than when Obama took office. He vilifies Southerners because we do not vote for Democrats. Eric Holder had the Southern states on his speed dial, ready to sue over any perceived \"racial issue.\" In short, the North and the South are like two different countries, which was the South's point when we seceded.

    "DiffbotBody": "Hype can be a dangerous thing in fantasy football. Sure, it's great to know who this year's rising stars and hot sleepers are. The problem begins when everyone starts reading the same reports. Writing their own takes based on those reports. Targeting the same players based on what they've read and/or written. That, in turn, drives up the asking price of those sleepers and value plays. A running back who was being drafted close to his fantasy floor rises nearer to his ceiling. That late-round lottery ticket wideout goes from $1 scratcher to one of those big, shiny ones that cost 20 bucks. In 2014, everyone and their mother (hi Mom!) were convinced that San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green was going to take the reins from Antonio Gates. Green's Average Draft Position rose steadily throughout the summer, to the point he was drafted ahead of the future Hall of Famer. Well, Gates caught 12 touchdowns and finished as a top-five tight end in most scoring systems. Green caught 19 passes all season long. With that cautionary tale in mind, here are a handful of players for whom hype levels are redlining in 2015. Begin Slideshow » Average Draft Position: QB4 (37th overall) I will be the first person to admit that I'm an unabashed fan of Seattle Seahawks quarterback . My admiration for him as a player borders on man-crush levels. And Wilson is coming off a phenomenal season, both from an NFL and fantasy football perspective. Wilson set career highs in passing yards (3,475), rushing yards (849) and rushing touchdowns (six) en route to leading the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Wilson also posted the best fantasy finish of his three-year career, finishing fifth at his position in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. With Wilson headed into the final year of his rookie deal, there has been speculation that Wilson could be set to become the highest-paid player in NFL history. Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated might not be willing to go quite that far, but you'll get no argument from him that Wilson's worth a whole lotta money: Is Russell Wilson a franchise quarterback? I would posit that the answer lies somewhere between “Yes” and “Well, duh... of course he is.” He's accomplished things no other quarterback has accomplished through his first three seasons, and while he's had a lot of help, the Seahawks weren't going to win all those games and reach the Super Bowl twice with Tarvaris Jackson, Charlie Whitehurst or Matt Flynn under center. Wilson's asking price has gone way up in fantasy drafts as well. A player who was barely being drafted as a weekly starter a year ago is now going ahead of Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints. And that's no bueno. As things stand right now, fantasy owners are counting on Wilson bettering last year's career stats just to justify his asking price. Not exceed, mind you—justify. And this is a quarterback for the team that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL in 2014. Yes, much of Wilson's fantasy production is tied to his ability to hurt teams with his legs. But consider this—assuming that the Seahawks and Wilson do agree to an extension, do you think the team that just invested well over $100 million in Wilson is going to want him to carry the ball 118 times in 2015? Wilson's a great young player and a fine fantasy option. But with a top-five sticker price? Pass. Average Draft Position: RB20 (44th overall) You aren't going to get any argument that Todd Gurley is a talented, young running back. You won't get much that he's the best rookie ball-carrier to come down the pipe in some time. Mike Mayock of the NFL Network lauded the Rams' selection of Gurley with the No. 10 overall pick, comparing the 6'1\", 221-pounder to Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks: I like the Marshawn Lynch comparison. St. Louis wants to win games the same way that Seattle and San Francisco do in the same division, that is by running the football and playing great defense and special teams. Gurley has Olympic-type speed. I love this pick for St. Louis, which already has a great defense and Gurley will help out Nick Foles. It would appear that fantasy owners agree. Last year, Bishop Sankey of the Tennessee Titans was chosen as the first rookie running back in fantasy drafts, with an average draft position at My Fantasy League of RB25. Gurley is coming off the board a full five slots higher, ahead of veterans like Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers and Joique Bell of the Detroit Lions. There's just one problem—one huge, glaring problem. Gurley tore his ACL last November while at Georgia. Yes, the recovery time for such an injury isn't what it used to be. And reports from Rams' camp have been almost universally positive. However, even if Gurley is ready to rock for Week 1, as Thomas Emerick of Sporting News points out, we're likely to see a lot of second-year pro Tre Mason, at least early in the season: Fisher's approach to managing Gurley's workload will set the ceiling for September and October, where we'll probably see a snap limit and heavy dose of Mason. Gurley owners will hope this step takes place in August. St. Louis also drafted four desperately needed offensive linemen, and this run offense will depend on a young line jelling together and finding starters by fire. With Mason in the fold, there's no reason for the Rams to rush Gurley. And yet he's being drafted like a Week 1 bell cow. Those who pull that trigger better hope it turns out better than Sankey in 2014. Average Draft Position: WR16 (41st overall) There may not be a more hyped player in all of fantasy football than New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Keith Lipscomb of ESPN was one of any number of pundits who have gushed about Cooks' potential as the new No. 1 receiver in the Big Easy: I think the Saints are going to turn up the volume in Cooks' game in his sophomore season. In his first five games, he averaged just 4.1 yards at the catch (how far downfield he caught the ball), but in his final five games before his injury, that number was 12.0. You know the Saints still want to throw the football but don't have their top-two pass-catchers from last season. Cooks is a dynamic talent, and this season he'll get every opportunity to show the masses, including more chances to make plays down the field. It isn't just fantasy types, either. Chris Wesseling of NFL.com also wrote that Cooks could be on the verge of a breakout in his second NFL season: Now that Jimmy Graham and Kenny Stills have been shipped off to Seattle and Miami, respectively, there could be as many as 175-200 targets up for grabs in the Saints' aerial attack. With only a declining Marques Colston ahead of him in the pecking order, Cooks is sure to be a featured player after dominating offseason practices. And it's possible that breakout could happen. Cooks showed himself to be dangerous in the open field last year before a broken thumb ended his season, and with both Stills and especially Graham gone, someone is going to have to pick up the slack. The problem is that with all the buzz surrounding Cooks, his ADP has been steadily climbing. A player with one season of 550 receiving yards is being taken as a high-end fantasy WR2. And for Lipscomb's colleague Field Yates, that cost is just too high: There's a lot to like about Brandin Cooks' game, as he's shifty, elusive and a menace to tackle in open space. But he plays a position -- slot receiver -- that isn't often conducive to finding the end zone frequently. He's slotted as our 16th wide receiver, but I simply think the lack of touchdowns will be an issue from a fantasy perspective. The issue isn't even Cooks per se. It's the hype that's sucked all the value from a player now being drafted far closer to his fantasy ceiling than the floor. Average Draft Position: TE6 (75th overall) OK, so \"hype\" may not exactly be the best word to describe the buzz surrounding Julius Thomas, especially in fantasy circles. In fact, he needs a hug. Evan Silva's comments about Thomas over at Yahoo Sports more-or-less sum up the fantasy community's feelings about Thomas moving to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency this year: Julius Thomas was easily the biggest fantasy \"loser\" of this year's free agency period, going from a Broncos offense that ranked first and second in the NFL in scoring in 2013 and 2014, to a Jags team that finished 32nd and 32nd in those seasons. While Thomas may prove a useful real-life pickup for Jacksonville, the bottom could fall out on his fantasy production. I told you he needed a hug. Although that $9 million a season the Jaguars forked over probably makes the 27-year-old feel a little bit better. If I need to explain to you why going from the fantasy penthouse that is Peyton Manning in Denver to the fantasy outhouse that is Jacksonville and Blake Bortles, then might I recommend fantasy bowling? I hear fantasy cricket is—whatever happens during a cricket jiminy or whatever it's called. And yet Thomas is still being selected sixth at the tight end spot on average. That's ahead of Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles, who could be set for a big uptick in targets this year. Ahead of Jordan Cameron of the Miami Dolphins, who has the added advantage of an honest-to-goodness NFL quarterback throwing him passes in Ryan Tannehill. And far ahead of veteran Owen Daniels, who replaced Thomas in Denver. Have these people seen Bortles and the Jaguars play? Average Draft Position: D/ST1 (68th overall) From an NFL perspective, there's no arguing that the Seattle Seahawks have one of the NFL's very best defenses. In 2014, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. The year before, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. Scoring defense? First in 2014. First in 2013. Two years ago, all was well. The Seahawks also ranked fourth in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. Not great, but nothing to cry about. Last year? Tears galore. The Seahawks free-fell to 23rd. The change was brought about by big plays—or more appropriately, the lack of them. The Seahawks dropped from eighth in the NFL in sacks two seasons ago to 20th in 2014. In 2013, the Seahawks ranked fourth in takeaways. Last year, that number plummeted to 21st. Yes, those numbers could rebound in 2015. Or not. It's not as if the Seahawks made big upgrades to the pass rush in the offseason, and turnovers are a fluky stat. Spending a sixth-round pick (in a 12-team fantasy football league) on any team defense isn't advisable. Spending one on a fantasy defense (that finished outside the top 20 a year ago) because it's a great NFL defense is even worse. It's falling for the hype.

The Straw at Miracle Mile Deli When it comes to New York-style deli fare in the middle of the dessert, Miracle Mile Deli is about as good as you can do. For generations, this has been a family-run operation serving brisket of beef, corned beef, and matzoh ball soup. This year, the restaurant moved to a new freestanding location on 16th Street — and it serves beer and wine. It's truly a new age for this Valley landmark restaurant. You will experience a food coma if you eat this sandwich, so consider yourself warned. Which isn't to say you should let the prospect of sleeping away the afternoon deter you from ordering the Straw.

    "DiffbotBody": "Those of us who have been waiting since last winter for Bill Cosby to experience some legal retribution for the scores of sexual assault allegations against him are basking in a bit of schadenfreude this week. The comedian's deposition in the Andrea Costrand case – in which Cosby admits to giving at least one 19-year-old woman Quaaludes before sex – has been released to the public. In an especially satisfying twist, the Associated Press won its petition to have the decade-old documents unsealed for precisely the reason Cosby wanted them to remain private: They hurt his public image as a moral authority. Judge Eduardo C. Robreno declared that Cosby's self-appointment as a \"public moralist\" heightened public interest in the 2005 lawsuit, undermining his argument against releasing the documents. Judge Rebreno cites Cosby's infamous 2004 \"pound cake\" speech as evidence of the comedian's belief in himself as a moral authority. But he could have gone even further back in Cosby's career to unearth tons of similar examples. In retrospect, Bill Cosby's entire public life provides a treasure trove of flat-out hypocrisy. Here are 15 of the most egregious moments when Cosby's actions and declarations stand in stark contrast to his alleged crimes. 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",
    "LabBody": "Those of us who have been waiting since last winter for Bill Cosby to experience some legal retribution for the scores of sexual assault allegations against him are basking in a bit of schadenfreude this week. The comedian's deposition in the Andrea Costrand case – in which Cosby admits to giving at least one 19-year-old woman Quaaludes before sex – has been released to the public. In an especially satisfying twist, the Associated Press won its petition to have the decade-old documents unsealed for precisely the reason Cosby wanted them to remain private: They hurt his public image as a moral authority. Judge Eduardo C. Robreno declared that Cosby's self-appointment as a \"public moralist\" heightened public interest in the 2005 lawsuit, undermining his argument against releasing the documents. Judge Rebreno cites Cosby's infamous 2004 \"pound cake\" speech as evidence of the comedian's belief in himself as a moral authority. But he could have gone even further back in Cosby's career to unearth tons of similar examples. In retrospect, Bill Cosby's entire public life provides a treasure trove of flat-out hypocrisy. Here are 15 of the most egregious moments when Cosby's actions and declarations stand in stark contrast to his alleged crimes.",

Yet when a five-time illegal immigrant kills an innocent woman, no one cares. No politicians or protesters scream for the deportation of all illegal immigrants. The media hardly covered the story. I saw absolutely nothing in the Reading Eagle on July 6, and I haven't seen businesses firing any illegals they may have in their employ.

    "DiffbotBody": "Wildomar celebrated its seventh birthday as a city this weekend, but it got rolling as an agricultural community in about 1886. That’s about how long a crumbling, wood-frame farmhouse on Baxter Road has been around. Abandoned as a residence about 15 years ago and moved to its present locale in 2006, the structure is dubbed the Brown House in honor of the pioneering Wildomar family that occupied it for most of its 13-decade existence. “This is one of the only treasures that Wildomar has from that period,” said Kristan Lloyd of the Wildomar Historical Society. In recognition of its place in the community’s history, the society – headed by President George Cambero – has embarked on a campaign to save the house, as well as the surviving adjacent water tower. “The main idea is to somehow have a museum to represent the history of Wildomar and where we came from, the foundation that Wildomar was built on,” Lloyd said. For several generations, the buildings anchored the Brown family’s farm at Grand Avenue and McVicar Street in southwestern Wildomar. After the family sold the property, community leaders had the house and tower moved in 2006 to vacant land on Baxter near its junction with I-15. Although the structures now sit on 36 acres targeted for residential and commercial construction, the developer has offered to provide space for them, functioning as a future museum. For that to happen, however, the society must raise money for preservation, a process that is being initiated with a campaign to generate about $5,300 for an assessment. “The assessment is going to include (an analysis) for asbestos, lead, mold and structural (stability),” Lloyd said. “The object is to see if it’s refurbishable or renovatable to see if we want to put our money into that direction and save as much of the buildings as we can.” She said about $800 has been donated since the campaign started in March. Gloria Allred, a 27-year Wildomar resident who is unrelated to the famous attorney by the same name, has gotten involved as a volunteer to promote the cause. “I think it’s a very worthy cause and I think it needs some attention,” Allred said. The earliest maps created by the town’s founders – William Collier, Donald Graham and Margaret Collier Graham – indicated the existence of the house, said Wildomar City Councilman Bob Cashman. Also a society member, Cashman compiled a photographic history of Wildomar that was released by Arcadia Publishing in its “Images of America” series. The city’s name is an amalgamation of the first syllables of the three founders’ first names. Margaret, sister of Collier, married Graham and came West with the two friends and business partners. They bought much of the land that eventually would become the distinct communities of Wildomar and Elsinore. Margaret Graham, a poet and fiction writer, gave Elsinore its name from a reference in Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” 1 2 Next Page According to Cashman’s book, Dr. Oscar Brown, a physician for the Santa Fe Railroad, settled in Wildomar in 1897 and his family took possession of the property encompassing the already established house. Brown’s son Rudolph later took possession, followed by Rudolph’s son David A. Brown, for whom a middle school on Grand is named. Though the house’s original walls still stand, they disappeared behind a series of additions and expansions, so that the modestly Victorian-styled house now encompasses well more than 1,000 square feet. “Of course, as what happens so often in the West, it was built on to accommodate more people and more people and more people,” Cashman said. “I think the last addition was in the 1930s. ... We know when each part was built, and we know which part of it was the original structure.” Ultimately, Lloyd estimated that it could cost as much as $285,000 to get the buildings in shape to house a museum. Allred is confident it can happen. “We’re going to preserve it and maintain a piece of the history of Wildomar,” she said. “If you don’t know where you’ve been, how are you going to know where you’re going?” Contact the writer: 951-368-9690 or michaelwilliams@pe.com Prev Page 1 2",

It doesn’t matter if you’ve ever gone through the same experiences as the main character in the picture because, in the end, it’s not about that. It’s about how you feel when you see them succeed or fail, or what it means to you when they go through joy or heartache. Films in general have the power to move you. But documentaries, they have the power to inspire change. With that, these are the pictures we feel represent the top five sports documentaries of all time. 1. The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters Director: Seth Gordon Release date: 2007 It may seem a bit unconventional to put a film about video games on a list of great sports documentaries, but, The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters is so much more than a movie about gaming enthusiasts. What Seth Gordon does with this 2007 documentary is present a picture of what it means to strive for greatness. As outsider Steve Wiebe attempts break the World Record for Donkey Kong, and in the process dethrone video game legend Billy Mitchell, we’re thrust into a world that few knew existed — competitive gaming. This doc is funny and sad. It’s eccentric and bizarre. It’s frustrating and compelling. How far will one person go to be the best, and what lengths will the best go to ensure his or her place in history? In the end, that idea is the true essence of The King of King: A Fistful of Quarter. 2. Dogtown and Z-Boys Director: Stacy Peralta Release date: 2001 Directed by Stacy Peralta, an original member of the Zephyr skating team, the award-winning Dogtown and Z-Boys is a movie about the cultural revolution of skateboarding. These guys changed the sport forever in the 1970s by challenging conventional wisdom, and bringing their surfing skills to the street. The Z-Boys pushed the envelope, and perfected their skills in the empty pools of Venice and Santa Monica. Their energy, fire, and desire to push the limits made these teenagers stars. Narrated by Sean Penn and filled with old b-roll footage, vintage photos of the team, and current interviews, Dogtown and Z-Boys shows how a group of teenage surfers sparked a major change in the skateboarding landscape. 3. The Endless Summer Director: Bruce Brown Release date: 1966 Have you ever wished that summer could last forever? That’s what director Bruce Brown tackles in the 1966 documentary, The Endless Summer. This film follows surfers Michael Hynson and Robert August as they navigate the world in search for the perfect wave. But what this picture really does is introduce the world to the culture of surfing. Surfing is more than just a sport, it’s a lifestyle. And what made this documentary connect with a wider audience was because of the personal manner in which it was shot. As famed film critic Roger Ebert stated in his review of the film: If the film itself offers exactly what it promises — 91 minutes of wish fulfillment — the manner of its filming must offer the same thing for professional filmmakers. Shunning the tons of equipment ordinarily taken along on location, Brown used only what he could carry. The beautiful photography he brought home almost makes you wonder if Hollywood hasn’t been trying too hard. This sounds a lot like what’s going on in today’s entertainment industry. Perhaps, The Endless Summer’s ability to showcase “what could be,” is exactly what continues to make the film so timeless. That, and the breathlessly iconic one sheet helps sum up this movie in one word: beautiful. 4. When We Were Kings Director: Leon Gast Release date: 1996 Leon Gast’s 1996 Academy Award-winning documentary, When We Were Kings chronicles one of the most important sporting events in history: “The Rumble in the Jungle.” This 1974 heavyweight title bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire was more than just a boxing match, it was a spectacle unlike anything ever seen before. Ali’s charm, confidence, and swagger is on full display in this documentary that contains original footage from 1974. This picture also showcases the cultural effect and controversial personality that made Ali such a fascinating individual. In this documentary, Ali says to the media, “I’m young, I’m handsome, I’m fast, I’m strong, and I can’t be beat.” That speech pretty much sums up this documentary verbatim; it’s just that good. 5. Hoop Dreams Director: Steve James Release date: 1994 There can be no discussion about sports documentaries without the inclusion of Steve James’ Hoop Dreams. This film follows two inner-city basketball players, William Gates and Arthur Agee, through their high school years, as they attempt to improve their skills and use the sport to better their lives. The goal for each? College scholarships and perhaps, one day, a future in the NBA. Hoop Dreams is a powerful, moving, touching, heartbreaking, and hopeful piece of cinema that borders on a sociological examination of the struggles that young athletes of the lower class face. It was Roger Ebert’s belief that,”Hoop Dreams, however, is not only a documentary. It is also poetry and prose, muckraking and expose, journalism and polemic. It is one of the great moviegoing experiences of my lifetime.” We couldn’t have said it better ourselves. Want more great content like this?

Never before has Bryant been so open and forthcoming about himself. And despite the surprise that many must have felt to see this side of Kobe, it shouldn’t actually be that much of a shock.

Nightmares are most common in preschoolers, children 3 to 6 years old. This is when normal fears develop and a child’s imagination is very active. What triggers a night terror? Night terrors can be triggered by stressful events in your child’s life, extreme tiredness, being startled by a loud noise or a sudden change in bedtime schedule. Night terrors can also increase your child’s anxiety during the day, even if they don’t remember them, Rogers says. What to do when you witness a night terrorThe most important thing is to not restrain or wake up your child. Restraining your child may cause the night terror to last longer and upset your child. Attempting to wake your child will cause him to be confused and disoriented. If you find your child sleepwalking in the night, gently lead him back to bed. It’s disturbing to watch your child’s night terror the first few times. He appears to be awake, is moving around but is unresponsive; this is scary. “Like growing pains, night terrors seem to be an uncomfortable but harmless part of growing up for some children,” she says.But if night terrors continue after you try to prevent them or if your child is constantly having nightmares and is scared to go to bed, Rogers suggests speaking with a pediatrician or counselor to seek more support.

Joseph Pitts said, \"Today's ruling will lead to grave infringements of religious freedom across the United States\" (\"Public officials, leaders of advocacy groups react,\" Reading Eagle, June 27). I fail to see how my religious freedom is being compromised or affected by the marriage of a gay couple. Pitts is aware that the marriage ceremony need not be conducted by a member of the clergy, hence no clergy is forced to marry a gay couple, although many are willing to do so. Some will say that gay marriage violates the tradition of marriage. Well it was not too long ago that it was traditional for Italians to marry Italians, Jews to marry Jews and whites to marry whites. That tradition has been altered. I get annoyed when people wish to introduce their religious beliefs into the discussion of this matter of gay marriage. Quoting the Bible doesn't work for me. It is foolish to base one's view of life on ideas that, however plausible at the time 2,000 to 4,000 years ago, now appear to be quite erroneous. And what would be more important than to find our true place in the universe by removing one by one these unfortunate vestiges of earlier beliefs?

    "DiffbotBody": "In 2014, the Giants' Odell Beckham Jr. practically made the \"No Fun League\" fun again, and he did it with one hand behind his back. Literally. Beckham's one-handed catch against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 12, seen by a national audience on Sunday Night Football, is not only considered one of the best grabs of all-time (let's not forget that, in addition to making the catch while falling down, he was being interfered with), it also helped usher in a new era for wide receivers – not just in the pros, but at seemingly every level of the game. Since ODB's remarkable catch, high school and college wideouts across the country have begun an informal competition to see who can make the most jaw-dropping grab, populating YouTube, Vine and Instagram with athletic, acrobatic clips that – while wholly unnecessary – are enough to give even the most stoic of football traditionalists pause. And if the trend continues, perhaps one day we'll all be tuning in to the Pro Bowl Skills Competition to watch the NFL's best pass-catchers strut their stuff, a la the NBA's Slam Dunk Contest. Heck, give the winner the ODB Award for Excellence. And if that day ever comes, these young athletes might be the guys vaulting their way to the top of the contest. Here are 10 of the best flipping catches you'll ever see: 10. Moses Ellis Jr. This one actually predates Beckham's grab by two years, but that doesn't make it any less impressive – especially when you consider that Ellis actually played defensive back Prairie View A\u0026M. Sadly, he didn't realize his dream of playing in the NFL (he was most recently in the Indoor Football League), but could he be the Godfather of the backflip catch? Beckham Grade: OD-Before-it-was-cool. 9. Jace James Despite its optimistic title, this flip-catch by James, now a junior at Glenbard North High School in Illinois, did not go viral like the rest. A critic could say that it lacks the wow factor of some of the other grabs on the list, but let's see any of them pull it off. While wearing neon, nonetheless. Beckham Grade: Odell Beckham slow-clap. 8. Justice Murphy A three-star recruit out of Washington, Murphy is committed to play at Wyoming next season, but it was over a year ago when he Cowboy'd Up with this this leaping, backflipping, snag-the-ball-then-fall grab. It deserves a place on this list for being ahead of the trend, and for the fact that he's running a route. Beckham Grade: Odell, well done. 7. \"Tony C\" The C stands for \"Catch of the Century.\" The only non-football player on the list, and the only one to use a trampoline (cheat), this acrobatic mid-air, one-handed grab of a long-distance throw deserves points for creativity and level of difficulty. The fact that it made it onto SportsNation is testament to its greatness, if only for the fact that Tony didn't break his leg like we all expected. Beckham Grade: ODB #Cheatcode 6. Ty Betka After spending two seasons at Drake, Betka walked on as a receiver at Nebraska last fall. At just 5-foot-7, 165 pounds, and with little to show on his resume, Betka still faces a long uphill battle for in-game relevancy in Lincoln, but he's certainly making a name for himself on Instagram. Still, the flip itself is straight-on, and the extra flips are unnecessary. Beckham Grade: OK-DB, Jr. 5. Jenson Stoshak Stoshak caught 37 passes as a junior at Florida Atlantic University last year, but he makes three grabs in a row right here – with a backflip on each for posterity – and makes it all look so relatively easy. I could do without the goofy dude at the end, though. Beckham Grade: OD-Been there, done that. 4. Marco Wilson Wilson is slated to go play football for the Florida Gators in not one, but two years from now. Only 16 years old, the sophomore at American Heritage High School takes the \"flip catch\" and turns it on its head by taking the ball at an angle and with only one hand. Beckham Grade: OD-hell yeah. 3. Tarik Cohen As a sophomore at North Carolina A\u0026T, Cohen hauled in 25 passes for 237 yards last season (he also ran for 15 scores), but you can bet none were as amazing as this backflip catch. Cohen takes the difficult level up a notch by already holding onto one ball as he makes the grab. Beckham Grade: At your Beckham call. 2. Nigel Knott Knott is barely 17 years old, but he's already catching the ball like a full-grown man (with a background in Parkour). In what could be dubbed \"The Spider-Man Catch,\" Knott runs up a wall, flips upside down, makes the grab and sticks the landing. Yet Knott is mulling offers from Oregon, Alabama, FSU and others as a cornerback, not a wide receiver. Opposing quarterbacks at the next level beware: Any time you throw it in Knott's direction, he may flip turn upside down quicker than Will Smith moving to Bel-Air and make the pick. Beckham Grade: O-damn, Get 'em. 1. Nyheim Hines Another high school player doing things that would be incomprehensible if we didn't see it with our own eyes, the senior is committed to play at NC State in the fall. If he ever makes a catch in a game like the 720-spinner shown in this video though, it will be a highlight for the ages. Beckham Grade: He went Beck-HAM! 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",

I would like to start by saying I have been a school custodian for more than 26 years making schools clean and safe for all staff and students. First of all, the floor strippers are of low odor and should not be able to be smelled out on the street let alone by those driving by in a vehicle. Second, the products are water soluble and actually mix with water to work. Third, it is not uncommon for flooring kept up with proper care to last for 20-plus years. I think that’s cost effective. Fourth, as far as extending the year, here’s how that works. Teachers are contracted for 10 months, most office staff are contracted for 11 months, custodians are contracted for 12 months. Yes, floors are just a part of the tried-and-true summer cleaning routine. That is also the time where light fixtures to flooring and everything in between get a hands-on cleaning.

Mechling Rohnert Park Here’s the problem Editor: I get it: The lure and seduction of wine as a current and potentially harmful phenomena. This is a beautiful place to live and thrive, to grow and to welcome visitors. Yet, there’s the significant question of excessiveness with just too much in order to withstand the impact upon water, use of pesticides and events with increased traffic. In jeopardy is the stability of local agriculture (livestock, produce, grape growers and wineries) to describe the standards of living for local purveyors. While economic development may encourage healthy lifestyles, the current answer reveals mere trends with little consideration toward maintaining a quality of life which truly stabilizes the why in the first place. Soon, the initial attractions will no longer have their attractive place in time. What’s then left is a vacancy unable to reconstruct; just too expensive and inaccessible. The “service” sector will not exist, nor then will the schools, neighborhoods, businesses, security, history, culture and diversity. The danger is an unhealthy environment. Literally. Barbara Harris Sebastopol A better solution Editor: Bill O’Reilly of Fox News is advocating Kate’s Law in response to the recent horrific circumstances resulting in Kate Steinle’s murder in San Francsico. His proposal would mandate five-year prison sentences for first-time illegal felons, 10 years for second-time offenders and 20 years for third-time offenders. This would obligate the American taxpayer to provide total housing, food, medical care and basic needs to an unconscionable increase in the already impacted prison population we have. Might a better solution be to recognize our neighbor country Mexico and direct funds and assistance that are presently going to distant countries with little appreciative benefit and recognition. If we were to partner with the leadership in Mexico, they may be able to improve their economy, incarcerate their own citizens, protect the borders and offer homeland opportunities to their citizens. Thus, the illegal immigration may become less attractive or deemed necessary and be beneficial to each of our countries. Shirley Walker Petaluma How about higher? Editor: “Raise the smoking age to 21” (Editorial, Thursday.) Even better, raise it to 80. Gary Anderson Santa Rosa Not made for this Editor: Gov. Jerry Brown’s audacious prison plan, called “realignment,” began in October 2011. Numerous reports have shown increased crime since the plan took effect. Proponents of realignment have dismissed those reports as being “too early to tell.” Thursday’s paper contained two reports on the subject of “realignment.” A story on page B3 stated that after decades of declines, Los Angeles is experiencing a 13 percent rise in crime. Page B5 showed that currently 54 percent of felons are back behind prison walls within three years compared to 67.5 percent in 2011. Is it still too early to tell? Regardless of one’s political leanings, what is clear is that county jails, which were designed to house inmates for one year or less, are now used to house felons for multiple years. Fifteen-year sentences to serve time inside a county jail is not unheard of anymore. To be sure, some money comes from the state to fund the increased burden counties incurred as a result of realignment. The rest comes from the county’s general budget. Isn’t it ironic that the response to inadequate health care in state prisons is to force counties to shoulder the burden? As Los Angeles is discovering, the costs forced upon local government are more than fiscal. Dale C. Miller Owner, Romelli Bail Bonds Santa Rosa Stand firm Editor: San Francisco must not be dissuaded from maintaining its sanctuary movement to protect undocumented immigrants from cruel and unusual treatment thru the inhumane deportation process. Granted one person, one very undesirable person, fell thru the cracks and murdered a special young woman. That occurrence was not the fault of the city and county of San Francisco. What about the murderer’s country of origin? Why did his country allow him free to leave his country? It seems that much better communication between agencies of the U.S. with the agencies of other countries needs to happen. But, San Francisco must maintain its practice of protecting undocumented immigrants. Cassandra Lista Santa Rosa",

    "DiffbotBody": "Commentators are probably right in assessing that Brianna Keilar’s CNN interview with Hillary Clinton was not quite the love-in that many of us anticipated. (See Jim Geraghty’s review of the Clinton interview, here.) Still, you have to mourn the media’s lack of self-respect: as Jim pointed out in Wednesday’s Morning Jolt, Mrs. Clinton blatantly lied when she claimed, “I’ve never had a subpoena” from a congressional committee regarding Benghazi. There was nothing subtle about it. Clinton was totally banking on CNN’s inclination to let her slide. Well, they don’t call it the Clinton News Network for nothing. It is the network of Candy Crowley, who in the middle of a presidential candidates’ debate couldn’t restrain herself from inappropriately challenging – and misleadingly correcting – Mitt Romney’s remarks about Benghazi. But somehow, when Benghazi came up in a one-on-one media interview setting, CNN couldn’t bring itself to call Mrs. Clinton on an obvious lie. It is well known that Mrs. Clinton was subpoenaed in March by the House select committee investigating the Benghazi Massacre. The matter is indisputable. Plus, it was Keilar who brought up the subject of the subpoena, so one has to assume she did a modicum of research – which is all it would have taken to be ready to challenge Clinton’s false assertion. Yet, in the context of being asked about her destruction of emails from her private server, Clinton was permitted to tell the public she had not been subpoenaed. Thus, without impunity, she was able to frame suspicions that she has willfully obstructed probes of the Benghazi Massacre as outlandish. Jim notes that, in March, Chairman Trey Gowdy’s Benghazi committee released a public statement reporting that it had “issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya.” Moreover, we also know that Benghazi Committee Democrats – apparently thinking it would help Mrs. Clinton(!) – publicly released a March 27 letter from Clinton’s counsel, David Kendall, in which the subpoena is acknowledged and analyzed at length. In the letter (which Shannen Coffin discussed here at National Review back in March), Kendall states that the Committee issued a “subpoena duces tecum” – essentially, a subpoena that compels the witness to produce documents. The subpoena demanded production of “documents, for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.” Those would be (a) the eight months before the September 11, 2012, Benghazi Massacre, when security at the State Department compound was reduced despite jihadist attacks and an intensified terrorist threat, and (b) the three-and-a-half months after the attack, when the administration misled the public about the nature of the attack and identity of the attackers while trumping up a prosecution against the producer of the Innocence of Muslims video, on which the administration fraudulently blamed the murders of four Americans. The documents called for by the subpoena are those “referring or relating to” the following for categories: “Libya (including but not limited to Benghazi and Tripoli)”; “Weapons located or found in, imported or brought into, and/or exported or removed from Libya”; “The attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012”; “Statements pertaining to the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012.” There is no question that the subpoena was issued to Mrs. Clinton personally. Kendall says it was “issued by the Benghazi Select Committee to the Hon. Hillary R. Clinton.” Furthermore, by mutual agreement between the committee and the Clinton camp, it was served on Mrs. Clinton, apparently by delivery to her agent for that purpose (probably Mr. Kendall’s firm, but the letter doesn’t say). Kendall is Mrs. Clinton’s personal attorney, and his letter states that the subpoena was “served by agreement on March 4, 2015.” Given that Chairman Gowdy is an experienced litigator and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton was represented by counsel, it was consistent with professional ethical rules to arrange delivery of the subpoena – and discuss the subpoena thereafter – with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer. And, of course, Mrs. Clinton is also a lawyer with congressional committee experience – she is well aware that service of process upon a witness’s agent by consensual arrangement with witness’s lawyer is the legal and factual equivalent of personal service on the witness. In addition, it is quite apparent that Kendall could not have written a letter extensively responding to the subpoena requests without first having discussed the subpoena with his client, Mrs. Clinton. When Hillary Clinton told CNN, “I’ve never had a subpoena,” she was lying. Since that is what Mrs. Clinton often does, a reporter who fails to challenge her – in an interview for which the reporter had lots of time to prepare, and on a subject the reporter brought up – must be either incompetent or colluding in the lie. Such collusion might be because the reporter supports the candidate, the reporter and her network want to maintain access the candidate, or both. I don’t think Ms. Keilar is incompetent.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A few times a year, my husband goes away for a long weekend, and the kids and I are left alone for three or four days. The kids and I take advantage of these \"Dad-free\" weekends to do silly things like wear our pajamas all day long (usually my choice) or eat waffles for supper (usually the kids' choice). But one of the kids' most frequent requests is being allowed to sleep in my bed. The first time I acceded to this request, I knew right away it was a mistake. I was smart enough to really tire the kids out first - I let my daughter skip her nap, and I let her and my son swim in the pool for an hour and a half after supper - then I read them several of their favorite bedtime stories by the light of a flashlight. Finally, I tucked them into bed on either side of me with big goodnight kisses. And I thought they'd snuggle right in and drop off into peaceful slumber within minutes. Boy, was I wrong. Well, I wasn't entirely wrong. They did drop off within a few minutes, but there was absolutely nothing peaceful about it. There was thrashing. There was snorting. There was kicking. There was major blanket hogging. There was more thrashing. It was like trying to sleep inside a washing machine. So last weekend, when my husband was away again and my children begged and pleaded to sleep with me, I thought I'd be smart and I let them sleep in my room, but not in my bed. After we had all finished our evening ablutions, I sent them to their room to collect pillows, blankets and assorted stuffed animals, and I had them each pick a spot on the carpet and make themselves a cozy little nest. Much like dogs, they had to examine and sniff and test out multiple spots before they finally settled on the perfect spot - a selection which was mostly decided by my pronouncement that wherever they were by the time I finished counting to 20 was where they were staying for the night. And for the first 30 seconds or so after I turned out the lights, all was peaceful. And then my daughter announced that she needed to use the potty. So I flipped on the bathroom light and sent her on her way. Naturally, her bathroom trip inspired my son to suddenly (and desperately) need a drink of water. Which reminded my daughter that she hadn't gotten a drink of water, after which she decided she needed the potty again. This cycle continued for several minutes until I announced that bathroom breaks were over for the night unless it was a DIRE EMERGENCY. This resulted in another 30 seconds or so of peace. Which was followed by a loud fake hiccup, followed by another loud fake hiccup from the other side of the room, followed by giggling, which soon erupted into uproarious laughter. I shushed the hiccupers and listened carefully for their breathing to slow as they drifted off, but there was no drifting. What there was, however, was climbing. Two little bodies stealthily crept into my bed, worming and twisting their way under the blankets and twining themselves around my arms and legs. Which was very sweet and pleasant for a few moments, until each of them discovered that the other one was on the other side of me, and I found myself at the center of a maelstrom of sibling rivalry involving much flailing of fists and feet. Needless to say, they were immediately banned (again) from the bed. Once the sobbing had subsided to an occasional wounded sniff, I bid them goodnight (again), and drifted off to sleep myself. They, however, did not follow suit, and I was woken from my pleasant slumber mere moments later by the sound of small footsteps tiptoeing not so lightly around the room. Without opening my eyes, I barked at them to get back into their nests and the footsteps beat a hasty retreat back to their respective corners. Ah, peace once again. But alas, a short-lived peace. This time, a single set of small footsteps crept quietly from one nest to the other, followed by mutters of protest from the inhabitant of the second nest, mutters which rapidly grew to shouts. Exasperated, I ordered them back to their own beds in their own rooms, in the hope that even if they kept each other awake all night, at least I would get some rest.

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. These haters on the Republican side will not be pleased with a new poll that has revealed Trump is the top GOP challenger in North Carolina. According to Conservative Tribune, Trump topped the poll with a whopping 16% of the vote. Jeb Bush and Scott Walker tied for second with 12% and Mike Huckabee came in right behind them with 11%. The poll was conducted by the Democrat-leaning Public Policy Polling found that Trump’s surge was due mostly to an increasing favorability rating among men and young people. “Trump’s favorability rating in North Carolina is 55/32, much higher than we were finding in national polls prior to his entry into the race,” PPP’s report said. “Trump’s really caught fire with voters on the far right — 66% of ‘very conservative’ voters see him favorably to only 24 percent with a negative view of him. Trump is polling particularly well with younger voters (29 percent) and men (20 percent).” They added that Trump’s numbers are being boosted by conservative independents in particular. “Among ‘very conservative’ Republicans, only 37 percent see him favorably to 44 percent who have a negative opinion of him and only 7 percent of those voters support him for the nomination, putting him in seventh place in the GOP field,” PPP continued. The PPP found that Hillary Clinton still has the lead among Democrats in North Carolina, with her polling in at 55%. However, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her with 20% of the vote. Are you a Trump supporter? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.",

    "DiffbotBody": "In the second of a series of four features, Matt Nesbitt breaks the PL player pool down position by position. Taking a look at the key stats from last season to highlight every teams’ top performers and give us a steer for the upcoming campaign. Let’s look at the defenders… All players must’ve played 15 matches to be considered and have been measured in the following categories: Appearances (Apps), Clean Sheets (CS), Assists (Ass), Goals (Gls), Yellow and Red Cards (YC, RC). Players are listed per team, in recommended order of Fantasy value, or appeal for next season. Chelsea Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Ivanovic 38 17 (44%) 6 4 10 1 Azpilicueta 27 14 (51%) 4 0 1 1 Terry 38 17 (44%) 0 5 2 0 Cahill 34 14 (41%) 1 1 5 0 To ponder: Branislav Ivanovic will be top of many manager’s list and rightly so. Ever present, with excellent clean sheets, assists and goals contributions. No reason to think anything will change this season. John Terry managed every minute of every PL match, but with another year on the clock that will prove difficult to repeat. So left-back Cesar Azpilicueta gets the nod as 2nd most eligible. Man City Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Zabaleta 29 11 (37%) 5 1 6 1 Mangala 25 11 (44%) 0 2 3 1 Kolarov 16 9 (56%) 3 2 4 0 Demichelis 28 9 (32%) 0 1 6 0 To ponder: Pablo Zabaleta had a poor season by his high standards, but still turned in some decent numbers and remains the City ‘banker’. Eliaquim Mangala found his feet in the second half of the season and stopped finding those of his opponents – after six yellow cards and one red in his first ten matches for City, he didn’t get any in his most recent ten. The French stopper looks first choice, so squeezes Aleksandar Kolarov into third place. Can’t fault the Serbs’ stats, but there are doubts over how often he will play. And who for. Arsenal Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Koscielny 26 11 (42%) 0 3 4 0 Mertesacker 35 12 (34%) 1 0 2 0 Bellerin 17 7 (41%) 1 2 5 0 Monreal 25 9 (36%) 2 0 3 0 To ponder: Laurent Koscielny remains Arsenal’s key defender for Arsene Wenger and Fantasy managers alike. But question marks remain over the full-backs. Calum Chambers and Keiran Gibbs don’t make the list, but their figures aren’t very different from Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal. Plus, a fit again Mathieu Debuchy will also challenge. Man United Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Smalling 20 5 (25%) 0 4 1 1 Jones 21 6 (28%) 1 0 3 0 Rojo 20 6 (30%) 0 0 6 0 To ponder: Not many clues here. Neither Luke Shaw nor Jonny Evans played enough matches to qualify (although Evans posted a by far the best CS ratio – 38%). Smalling looks the best of a bad lot as it stands, but expect a new face or two – Coleman and Ramos have been mooted and would instantly be the pick. With - an injury-free - Luke Shaw the next best option. Tottenham Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Trippier* 38 10 (26%) 4 0 2 0 Rose 27 6 (22%) 5 3 7 0 Dier 26 6 (23%) 4 2 4 0 Vertongen 31 7 (22%) 0 1 6 0 *Playing for Burnley To ponder: New right-back Kieran Trippier gets the nod based on impressive figures achieved in a struggling team – just two bookings is remarkable – and we can expect better. Danny Rose and Eric Dier both contributed well going forward, but Dier is yet to nail down a position. And will face competition from Jan Vertongen and Federico Fazio, who should both have a bigger influence this time around. Liverpool Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Clyne* 35 13 (37%) 1 2 4 0 Skrtel 33 12 (36) 0 1 8 0 Moreno 28 7 (25%) 0 2 6 0 Wisdom** 22 8 (32%) 1 0 1 0 Sakho 16 7 (43%) 0 0 1 0 *Playing for Southampton **Playing for West Brom To ponder: Nathaniel Clyne should hit the ground running at right back, so pips Martin Skrtel – who is never far from a howler and/ or cards. Spanish full-backs Jose Enrique and (on loan) Javier Manquillo managed just 11 games between them, so Alberto Moreno looks the next best option. Andre Wisdom is back from a decent spell at West Brom and could be a wildcard. Southampton Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Bertrand 34 13 (38%) 3 2 3 1 Fonte 37 15 (40%) 2 0 5 0 Yoshida 20 6 (30%) 1 1 3 0 To ponder: Nothing much to choose between Ryan Bertrand and Jose Fonte, the ex-Chelsea man getting the nod on his attacking potential. Southampton’s defensive record might suffer for the loss of their England full-back and influential players further forward. But we said that last year. Arriving right-back from Sporting Lisbon Cedric Soares might be worth a look. Swansea Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Taylor 34 13 (38%) 3 0 9 0 Williams 37 13 (35%) 0 0 6 0 Fernandez 28 10 (35%) 0 0 0 0 Rangel 23 7 (30%) 0 0 1 1 To pondor: Left-back Neil Taylor heads a solid list, especially reliable at home and v bottom six teams. Ashley Williams attracts regular attention from ‘bigger’ clubs, but Federico Fernandez offers equal appeal – and didn’t pick up so much as a booking in the PL. The arriving £3 million French left-back Franck Tabanou looks like cover for Taylor – who is partial to the odd yellow card. Stoke Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Shawcross 31 6 (19%) 1 2 7 0 Pieters 29 7 (24%) 2 0 8 0 Muniesa 17 6 (35%) 0 0 3 0 To ponder: Last season Stoke had the 4th best defence on the road. The season before, the 4th best at home. If they could pull both acts together Erik Peiters, Marc Muniesa and Ryan Shawcross would all be worthy additions. Shawcross edges the list based on goal threat. Crystal Palace Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Dann 33 6 (18%) 4 2 6 0 Ward 37 7 (18%) 0 1 4 0 Kelly 28 4 (14%) 1 0 2 0 To ponder: An exceptional attacking contribution from centre-back Scott Dann, unmatched in the PL. Palace legend Brede Hangeland missed the cut, featuring in just 14 matches but delivered two cleans sheets, two goals and an assist. Earning a new contract. Everton Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Baines 34 9 (26%) 10 2 4 0 Coleman 34 10 (29%) 3 3 5 0 Jagielka 37 10 (27%) 0 4 1 0 Stones 23 7 (30%) 0 1 1 0 To ponder: Everton’s poorest defensive showing for four seasons, but we can expect better and Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman should be on your shortlists regardless. Especially if Coleman ends up wearing red next season (at Man United you’d think his attacking numbers would improve dramatically). Don’t ignore Phil Jagielka either. He is still a safer bet than John Stones. West Ham Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Cresswell 38 9 (23%) 4 2 5 0 Tomkins 21 4 (19%) 3 1 6 0 Jenkinson* 29 9 (31%) 2 0 2 0 To ponder: I’ve taken the liberty of including Arsenal’s Carl Jenkinson at the expense of Winston Reid, assuming he confirms another loan year with the Hammers. Reid was less impressive than his contract demands would suggest last term, contributing a miserly three clean sheets and a clumsy ten yellow cards in his 27 matches. West Brom Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Lescott 34 15 (44%) 2 1 3 0 McAuley 23 12 (52%) 0 1 2 1 Dawson 29 11 (37%) 0 2 6 0 To ponder: Despite a huge 52% clean sheet average – bettered only by Man City’s Aleksandar Kolarov - Gareth McAuley is pipped by an outstanding showing from Joleon Lescott. With Pulis at the helm, West Brom won’t be shipping goals so Lescott is well worth a look. The same goes for Chris Brunt if he is re-categorized as a defender, having spent most of last season at left-back. From 33 matches, he provided nine assists and two goals. Leicester City Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Schlupp 30 8 (26%) 2 3 4 0 Morgan 37 10 (27%) 2 2 1 1 Wasilewski 24 6 (25%) 2 1 6 0 To ponder: A madcap season will not have inspired many Fantasy managers to stock up on Leicester defenders, but from the list right-back Jeffrey Schlupp is the pick. Although Robert Huth posted the outstanding figures from his 13 matches (six clean sheets, 46%). Newcastle Utd Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Janmaat 37 8 (21%) 6 1 6 1 Dummett 24 5 (20%) 0 0 4 0 Coloccini 32 7 (21%) 0 1 3 1 Williamson 27 5 (18%) 1 1 5 2 To ponder: On the subject of madcap… Realistically speaking, only right-back Darryl Janmaat warrants more than a cursory look. And even then through rose tinted lenses. The chaotic Fabricio Coloccini and Mike Williamson were symptomatic of Newcastle’s season and until some evidence of stability is restored, a complete swerve is recommended. Sunderland Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Van Aanholt 25 7 (28%) 5 0 4 0 Vergini 30 10 (33%) 0 0 6 0 O’Shea 36 12 (33%) 0 0 4 0 To ponder: An eye-brow raising number of clean sheets for Sunderland – nine 0-0 draws accounts for three quarters of them. But the ‘Goals Against’ column negated most of the benefit. Left-back Patrick van Aanholt tops Sunderland’s list on account of five assists. An injury-free Sebastian Coates plus new faces should improve the landscape, but exercise caution. Aston Villa Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Vlaar 19 7 (36) 1 0 3 1 Cissokho 25 7 (28%) 0 0 1 0 Richardson 15 5 (30%) 1 0 2 1 To ponder: No Villa defender played more than 25 matches, which only hints at their problems. Their best performer Ron Vlaar was released in the summer and the arrival of Micah Richards won’t answer all of Villa’s defensive issues. Bacuna missed the cut because he only played 11 matches, but they produced a commendable four clean sheets and five assists. However, all Villa defenders should be handled with care. Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. The volume of clean sheets will be hard to maintain in the PL, but will give us a guide – as will the goal and assist totals… Bournemouth Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Cook 46 19 (41%) 1 5 10 0 Francis 42 18 (42%) 6 1 8 1 Elphick 46 19 (41%) 2 1 6 0 To ponder: Five goals tells us centre-back Steve Cook offers a goal threat. And ten yellow cards suggest he will threaten the odd opponent too. Right-back Simon Francis attacking play might make him this season’s Keiran Trippier. Watford Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Angella 32 14 (43%) 4 2 5 2 Cathcart 28 10 (35%) 2 3 7 0 To ponder: Gabriele Angella was the star of Watford’s back-four, contributing well in all departments. But the two red cards might raise a query, particularly when you consider one was earned inside a minute. Craig Cathcart too offers a goal threat from centre-back. Norwich Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Whittaker 40 15 (37%) 5 2 3 0 Martin 48 14 (29%) 5 2 8 0 Olsson 45 13 (28%) 5 1 8 0 To ponder: Right-back Steven Whittaker and centre-back Russell Martin are both Scottish Internationals and capable of contributing going forward as well as defensively. Martin Olsson matched their impressive five assists last season and provides a threat from the left flank. Next up we’ll be turning the spotlight on midfielders.

In the second of a series of four features, Matt Nesbitt breaks the PL player pool down position by position. Taking a look at the key stats from last season to highlight every teams’ top performers and give us a steer for the upcoming campaign. Let’s look at the defenders… All players must’ve played 15 matches to be considered and have been measured in the following categories: Appearances (Apps), Clean Sheets (CS), Assists (Ass), Goals (Gls), Yellow and Red Cards (YC, RC). Players are listed per team, in recommended order of Fantasy value, or appeal for next season. Chelsea. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Ivanovic. 38. 17 (44%) 6. 4. 10. 1. Azpilicueta. 27. 14 (51%) 4. 0. 1. 1. Terry. 38. 17 (44%) 0. 5. 2. 0. Cahill. 34. 14 (41%) 1. 1. 5. 0. To ponder: Branislav Ivanovic will be top of many manager’s list and rightly so. Ever present, with excellent clean sheets, assists and goals contributions. No reason to think anything will change this season. John Terry managed every minute of every PL match, but with another year on the clock that will prove difficult to repeat. So left-back Cesar Azpilicueta gets the nod as 2nd most eligible. Man City. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Zabaleta. 29. 11 (37%) 5. 1. 6. 1. Mangala. 25. 11 (44%) 0. 2. 3. 1. Kolarov. 16. 9 (56%) 3. 2. 4. 0. Demichelis. 28. 9 (32%) 0. 1. 6. 0. To ponder: Pablo Zabaleta had a poor season by his high standards, but still turned in some decent numbers and remains the City ‘banker’. Eliaquim Mangala found his feet in the second half of the season and stopped finding those of his opponents – after six yellow cards and one red in his first ten matches for City, he didn’t get any in his most recent ten. The French stopper looks first choice, so squeezes Aleksandar Kolarov into third place. Can’t fault the Serbs’ stats, but there are doubts over how often he will play. And who for. Arsenal. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Koscielny. 26. 11 (42%) 0. 3. 4. 0. Mertesacker. 35. 12 (34%) 1. 0. 2. 0. Bellerin. 17. 7 (41%) 1. 2. 5. 0. Monreal. 25. 9 (36%) 2. 0. 3. 0. To ponder: Laurent Koscielny remains Arsenal’s key defender for Arsene Wenger and Fantasy managers alike. But question marks remain over the full-backs. Calum Chambers and Keiran Gibbs don’t make the list, but their figures aren’t very different from Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal. Plus, a fit again Mathieu Debuchy will also challenge. Man United. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Smalling. 20. 5 (25%) 0. 4. 1. 1. Jones. 21. 6 (28%) 1. 0. 3. 0. Rojo. 20. 6 (30%) 0. 0. 6. 0. To ponder: Not many clues here. Neither Luke Shaw nor Jonny Evans played enough matches to qualify (although Evans posted a by far the best CS ratio – 38%). Smalling looks the best of a bad lot as it stands, but expect a new face or two – Coleman and Ramos have been mooted and would instantly be the pick. With - an injury-free - Luke Shaw the next best option. Tottenham. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Trippier* 38. 10 (26%) 4. 0. 2. 0. Rose. 27. 6 (22%) 5. 3. 7. 0. Dier. 26. 6 (23%) 4. 2. 4. 0. Vertongen. 31. 7 (22%) 0. 1. 6. 0. *Playing for Burnley. To ponder: New right-back Kieran Trippier gets the nod based on impressive figures achieved in a struggling team – just two bookings is remarkable – and we can expect better. Danny Rose and Eric Dier both contributed well going forward, but Dier is yet to nail down a position. And will face competition from Jan Vertongen and Federico Fazio, who should both have a bigger influence this time around. Liverpool. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Clyne* 35. 13 (37%) 1. 2. 4. 0. Skrtel. 33. 12 (36) 0. 1. 8. 0. Moreno. 28. 7 (25%) 0. 2. 6. 0. Wisdom** 22. 8 (32%) 1. 0. 1. 0. Sakho. 16. 7 (43%) 0. 0. 1. 0. *Playing for Southampton. **Playing for West Brom. To ponder: Nathaniel Clyne should hit the ground running at right back, so pips Martin Skrtel – who is never far from a howler and/ or cards. Spanish full-backs Jose Enrique and (on loan) Javier Manquillo managed just 11 games between them, so Alberto Moreno looks the next best option. Andre Wisdom is back from a decent spell at West Brom and could be a wildcard. Southampton. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Bertrand. 34. 13 (38%) 3. 2. 3. 1. Fonte. 37. 15 (40%) 2. 0. 5. 0. Yoshida. 20. 6 (30%) 1. 1. 3. 0. To ponder: Nothing much to choose between Ryan Bertrand and Jose Fonte, the ex-Chelsea man getting the nod on his attacking potential. Southampton’s defensive record might suffer for the loss of their England full-back and influential players further forward. But we said that last year. Arriving right-back from Sporting Lisbon Cedric Soares might be worth a look. Swansea. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Taylor. 34. 13 (38%) 3. 0. 9. 0. Williams. 37. 13 (35%) 0. 0. 6. 0. Fernandez. 28. 10 (35%) 0. 0. 0. 0. Rangel. 23. 7 (30%) 0. 0. 1. 1. To pondor: Left-back Neil Taylor heads a solid list, especially reliable at home and v bottom six teams. Ashley Williams attracts regular attention from ‘bigger’ clubs, but Federico Fernandez offers equal appeal – and didn’t pick up so much as a booking in the PL. The arriving £3 million French left-back Franck Tabanou looks like cover for Taylor – who is partial to the odd yellow card. Stoke. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Shawcross. 31. 6 (19%) 1. 2. 7. 0. Pieters. 29. 7 (24%) 2. 0. 8. 0. Muniesa. 17. 6 (35%) 0. 0. 3. 0. To ponder: Last season Stoke had the 4th best defence on the road. The season before, the 4th best at home. If they could pull both acts together Erik Peiters, Marc Muniesa and Ryan Shawcross would all be worthy additions. Shawcross edges the list based on goal threat. Crystal Palace. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Dann. 33. 6 (18%) 4. 2. 6. 0. Ward. 37. 7 (18%) 0. 1. 4. 0. Kelly. 28. 4 (14%) 1. 0. 2. 0. To ponder: An exceptional attacking contribution from centre-back Scott Dann, unmatched in the PL. Palace legend Brede Hangeland missed the cut, featuring in just 14 matches but delivered two cleans sheets, two goals and an assist. Earning a new contract. Everton. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Baines. 34. 9 (26%) 10. 2. 4. 0. Coleman. 34. 10 (29%) 3. 3. 5. 0. Jagielka. 37. 10 (27%) 0. 4. 1. 0. Stones. 23. 7 (30%) 0. 1. 1. 0. To ponder: Everton’s poorest defensive showing for four seasons, but we can expect better and Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman should be on your shortlists regardless. Especially if Coleman ends up wearing red next season (at Man United you’d think his attacking numbers would improve dramatically). Don’t ignore Phil Jagielka either. He is still a safer bet than John Stones. West Ham. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Cresswell. 38. 9 (23%) 4. 2. 5. 0. Tomkins. 21. 4 (19%) 3. 1. 6. 0. Jenkinson* 29. 9 (31%) 2. 0. 2. 0. To ponder: I’ve taken the liberty of including Arsenal’s Carl Jenkinson at the expense of Winston Reid, assuming he confirms another loan year with the Hammers. Reid was less impressive than his contract demands would suggest last term, contributing a miserly three clean sheets and a clumsy ten yellow cards in his 27 matches. West Brom. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Lescott. 34. 15 (44%) 2. 1. 3. 0. McAuley. 23. 12 (52%) 0. 1. 2. 1. Dawson. 29. 11 (37%) 0. 2. 6. 0. To ponder: Despite a huge 52% clean sheet average – bettered only by Man City’s Aleksandar Kolarov - Gareth McAuley is pipped by an outstanding showing from Joleon Lescott. With Pulis at the helm, West Brom won’t be shipping goals so Lescott is well worth a look. The same goes for Chris Brunt if he is re-categorized as a defender, having spent most of last season at left-back. From 33 matches, he provided nine assists and two goals. Leicester City. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Schlupp. 30. 8 (26%) 2. 3. 4. 0. Morgan. 37. 10 (27%) 2. 2. 1. 1. Wasilewski. 24. 6 (25%) 2. 1. 6. 0. To ponder: A madcap season will not have inspired many Fantasy managers to stock up on Leicester defenders, but from the list right-back Jeffrey Schlupp is the pick. Although Robert Huth posted the outstanding figures from his 13 matches (six clean sheets, 46%). Newcastle Utd. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Janmaat. 37. 8 (21%) 6. 1. 6. 1. Dummett. 24. 5 (20%) 0. 0. 4. 0. Coloccini. 32. 7 (21%) 0. 1. 3. 1. Williamson. 27. 5 (18%) 1. 1. 5. 2. To ponder: On the subject of madcap… Realistically speaking, only right-back Darryl Janmaat warrants more than a cursory look. And even then through rose tinted lenses. The chaotic Fabricio Coloccini and Mike Williamson were symptomatic of Newcastle’s season and until some evidence of stability is restored, a complete swerve is recommended. Sunderland. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Van Aanholt. 25. 7 (28%) 5. 0. 4. 0. Vergini. 30. 10 (33%) 0. 0. 6. 0. O’Shea. 36. 12 (33%) 0. 0. 4. 0. To ponder: An eye-brow raising number of clean sheets for Sunderland – nine 0-0 draws accounts for three quarters of them. But the ‘Goals Against’ column negated most of the benefit. Left-back Patrick van Aanholt tops Sunderland’s list on account of five assists. An injury-free Sebastian Coates plus new faces should improve the landscape, but exercise caution. Aston Villa. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Vlaar. 19. 7 (36) 1. 0. 3. 1. Cissokho. 25. 7 (28%) 0. 0. 1. 0. Richardson. 15. 5 (30%) 1. 0. 2. 1. To ponder: No Villa defender played more than 25 matches, which only hints at their problems. Their best performer Ron Vlaar was released in the summer and the arrival of Micah Richards won’t answer all of Villa’s defensive issues. Bacuna missed the cut because he only played 11 matches, but they produced a commendable four clean sheets and five assists. However, all Villa defenders should be handled with care. Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. The volume of clean sheets will be hard to maintain in the PL, but will give us a guide – as will the goal and assist totals… Bournemouth. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Cook. 46. 19 (41%) 1. 5. 10. 0. Francis. 42. 18 (42%) 6. 1. 8. 1. Elphick. 46. 19 (41%) 2. 1. 6. 0. To ponder: Five goals tells us centre-back Steve Cook offers a goal threat. And ten yellow cards suggest he will threaten the odd opponent too. Right-back Simon Francis attacking play might make him this season’s Keiran Trippier. Watford. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Angella. 32. 14 (43%) 4. 2. 5. 2. Cathcart. 28. 10 (35%) 2. 3. 7. 0. To ponder: Gabriele Angella was the star of Watford’s back-four, contributing well in all departments. But the two red cards might raise a query, particularly when you consider one was earned inside a minute. Craig Cathcart too offers a goal threat from centre-back. Norwich. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Whittaker. 40. 15 (37%) 5. 2. 3. 0. Martin. 48. 14 (29%) 5. 2. 8. 0. Olsson. 45. 13 (28%) 5. 1. 8. 0. To ponder: Right-back Steven Whittaker and centre-back Russell Martin are both Scottish Internationals and capable of contributing going forward as well as defensively. Martin Olsson matched their impressive five assists last season and provides a threat from the left flank. Next up we’ll be turning the spotlight on midfielders.

    "DiffbotBody": "Speaking in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, on Thursday night, Pope Francis used his harshest language yet to denounce unfettered capitalism and the situation for the world’s poor, at one point calling the pursuit of money the “dung of the devil.” That was just one of the many bombshells contained in the hour-long speech, presented to the second World Meeting of Popular Movements. Although the speech had many highly-charged quotes, one that’s gotten a lot of media attention focuses on the pursuit of money. “And behind all this pain, death and destruction there is the stench of what Basil of Caesarea, one of the church’s first theologians, called ‘the dung of the devil.’ An unfettered pursuit of money rules. That is the dung of the devil.” It’s not clear if the Pope was making a hidden homage to Greece and its tattered economy when citing Basil of Caesarea, an ancient Greek bishop, but the current crisis there is no less relevant. The Holy Father went on describe the world’s new form of colonialism — which dropped even more hints about the Pope’s feelings on the EU bailout negotiations, among other things. “The new colonialism takes on different faces. At times it appears as the anonymous influence of mammon: corporations, loan agencies, certain ‘free trade’ treaties, and the imposition of measures of ‘austerity’ which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor.” Pope Francis made another reference to Basil’s devil’s dung analogy in a speech to Italy’s social services cooperatives after explaining that the organizations needed money to satisfy the needs of the people under their care. He made the case that money at the service of life — rather than the other way around — can bring good to people. The reference highlights the Pope’s complicated relationship with money and capitalism, especially the unfettered kind. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, he has said the current capitalist system is near collapse, a theme in his speech in Bolivia as well, and that real structural reform was in dire need. Still, the Catholic leader is careful to distance himself and the church from Communism, which was recently difficult thanks to Bolivian President Evo Morales. On Wednesday, the leader presented Francis with a crucifix made to look like the hammer and sickle symbol of Soviet Russia. According to CNN, the Pope’s words to Morales while receiving the gift aren’t entirely clear, but went something like “that’s not right” or “I didn’t know that.” Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi clarified the awkward moment, saying that the controversial crucifix would certainly not go in any church. Still, the Pope insists that it’s up to all Christians to work towards a just distribution of the “fruits of the Earth,” explaining to his audience in Bolivia that it is of the highest moral obligation. The full speech from Pope Francis can be found here. Aside from calling money the devil’s dung, the pope also apologized for the crimes of the early church against the America’s indigenous populations — which will likely receive a luke-warm reception as the Vatican prepares to make Junipero Serra a saint — and blasted the environmental destruction of the planet. [Image Credit: Getty Images] is the latest entry in the last-gen game being remastered for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One party. Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Shinzo Abe exuded self-confidence when he addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress two months ago. Japan’s prime minister told American lawmakers that he was determined to have the Diet pass new national-security legislation by the summer. He’s not so confident now. Mr. Abe has failed to wrap up deliberations on the package of bills he sent to the Diet to meet his summer deadline. Now he hopes to get the legislation passed by the end of September. Even if he succeeds and his party and its coalition partner have the votes to ram the legislation through in the end, public skepticism about—if not outright opposition to—Mr. Abe’s efforts to redefine the roles and missions of Japan’s self-defense forces appears to be growing stronger. Updating Japan’s national-security strategy is imperative given the momentous changes that have occurred in Japan’s security environment. China’s emergence as a great power and North Korea’s acquisition of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles are just two of the more dramatic ones. Under the legislation that Mr. Abe has proposed, Japan under certain circumstances would be able to come to the military assistance of the U.S. even in the absence of an attack on Japan itself. A war on the Korean Peninsula, for instance, would pose a direct threat to Japan’s own survival. Tokyo also could order its Self-Defense Forces to support United Nations peacekeeping operations, or provide logistics support for U.S. troops in conflict situations that don’t directly threaten Japan. In principle these are limited, sensible and necessary changes in Japan’s defense policy. But if the devil is often in the details, the devil in Mr. Abe’s legislation is in its ambiguity. The Japanese government can authorize the exercise of collective self-defense when Japan faces a situation that “threatens its survival.” And it can provide logistics support to U.S. troops in the case of “situations that have an important influence” on Japan. But Mr. Abe has done precious little to inform the public about what any of this might mean in practice. In Washington, the prime minister stressed that this legislative framework would make Japan “much more able to provide a seamless response for all levels of crisis.” U.S. officials responded enthusiastically to what he described as a sweeping change in Japanese security policy, the first of its kind in Japan’s postwar history. After getting back to Japan, Mr. Abe honed a different message for the Japanese people. “The use of force is strictly limited to measures for self-defense,” he said to the Diet committee vetting the legislation, “and not for the defense of another country per se. Japan’s basic policy of defensive defense is not changed one iota” by the new legislation. Legislators also pressed Defense Minister Gen Nakatani to admit that the new expanded role for Japan’s military would increase the risk to Japanese soldiers. Instead of saying outright that an increased risk to its soldiers was the price to be paid for reducing the risk to the country, he insisted that there would be no increase in the risk to personnel. That assertion was so implausible that he eventually had to reverse himself. The Diet testimony of the prime minister and his defense chief appeared to be an exercise in obfuscation. That only reinforced the public’s impression of a government that was not playing straight. Things went further downhill for Mr. Abe last month when three constitutional scholars were invited to testify at the lower house Commission on the Constitution. All three, including the scholar hand-picked by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, agreed that the law’s provision for the exercise of collective defense was unconstitutional. This threw Mr. Abe on the defensive, forcing him to defend the legality of his legislation against some of the country’s most respected constitutional scholars. Weeks later, a group of junior LDP Diet members held a “study session” with a popular novelist who is an Abe confidante and right-wing pundit. Several of the Diet members called for newspapers to face punishment for criticizing the Abe administration. This attack on press freedoms might not have caused such a stir if it had been an isolated incident. But it followed a series of statements—by officials, ruling-party figures and friends of the prime minister—that have sparked fears that the government is out to muzzle critical journalists. Prime Minister Abe is in a uniquely powerful position. His party and its coalition partner hold two-thirds of the seats in the lower house and a majority in the upper house. The political opposition is in disarray, and there are no challengers in sight. But hubris can be perilous. Concern over national security initially led the public to give Mr. Abe’s initiatives the benefit of the doubt. But now a new worry is emerging that this government is ready to ride roughshod over the Constitution, weaken press freedoms and rush to create a new legislative foundation for defense policy before there is a consensus on its necessity.

    "DiffbotBody": "BEMIDJI -- Nolan Coyle was on his A-game Tuesday night as he threw a complete game shutout to help the Bemidji Bucks beat the Grand Rapids Indians 4-0 at Security Insurance Field. Advertisement Coyle threw all nine innings of Tuesday’s game and struck out an astounding 14 batters while walking one and giving up five hits. Coyle was matched pitch-for-pitch early Grand Rapids starter Andrew Geislinger who went 7 1/3 innings and gave up four runs, three earned, on nine hits while striking out eight and walking one. After two innings both pitchers had given up one hit and struck out four each before both faced adversity in the third inning. In the top of the inning, Coyle gave up a leadoff single, but he tried to erase the runner in the next at-bat when he fielded a ball off the mound. He went for second to turn a double, but his throw pulled the second baseman Cody Jenkins off the base and both runners were safe. Coyle worked his way out of the inning however with one of his 14 strikeouts, followed by a groundball and a fly ball to right field to escape the inning. Geislinger wasn’t able to escape his half of the third unharmed. Jake Tuholsky drew a leadoff walk before a wild pitch allowed him to move up to second base. Right fielder Cody Benson moved him to third with a single before a Nick Hovila double play gave Tuholsky a chance to score. It wasn’t until the sixth inning when Coyle faced another scare after a one-out single followed by an error and a wild pitch put runners on second and third. Coyle responded with strikeout No. 9 on the night and then got a fly ball to left field to escape another jam. In the bottom half of the sixth is when the Bucks’ started batting. Connor McNallan started the inning with a single before Tyler Nelson moved him over with a tough grounder to the third base. McNallan later moved to third on a wild pitch. Steve Prichard got the team’s first RBI of the night when the Grand Rapids’ fielder went home on a groundball, but McNallan slid into the plate before the tag was applied to make it 2-0 Bucks. Jenkins hit a leadoff single to start the seventh and was replaced for pinch runner Jake Krabbehoff. Krabehoff stole second and with two outs got to third on a single by Hovila to put runners on the corners. Hovila took for second and was safe during the next at-bat, but the catcher’s throw was wild and allowed Krabbehoff to scamper home to make it 3-0 Bemidji. Tyler Nelson smacked a ball to deep left-center field to begin the bottom of the eighth, but was thrown out between second and third in a fielder’s choice during the next at-bat, but did allow Prichard to advance to second. Dylan Weisert hit a RBI single to give the Bucks its final insurance run of the game before Coyle came out and shut the door with a 1-2-3 ninth inning including his 14th strikeout of the night. Bemidji will be back in action at 6:30 p.m. tonight when it takes on Nimrod at Menhaga. Tuesday will be the battle of Bemidji at 7 p.m. when the Bucks take on the Bemidji Blue Ox at Security Insurance Field. It will be the first time the two teams have met.

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday's Euro-style pension panic for thousands of Australians military and public service retirees was a rocky start to the new era of \"smaller government\" in the federal superannuation authority. The newly merged Commonwealth Superannuation Authority, born of the \"red tape\" agenda, failed this week in a first attempt to perform a basic function – paying the pensions of the hundred of thousands of retirees who rely on public service or military superannuation. Sources close to the agency say the merger has been beset by resignations and cultural clashes between the CSC and the outfit it took over, the old ComSuper which ceased to exist on July 1. Questions are being raised over the delivery of government services on a number of fronts with the Australian Taxation Office under pressure over a failure to deliver online services and problems reported with Centrelink's electronic presence and the much vaunted MyGov portal. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann sent a statement from Europe saying he was concerned to learn of the payment delays but that he was confident that the merger of the two superannuation authorities was a success. The newly merged Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, which swallowed up ComSuper in a merger on July 1, had thousands of panicked military and public service retirees flooding its telephone and online systems on Wednesday and Thursday when their pensions were not paid. Some told Fairfax that the bungled pay day, the first with the CSC in charge, was the only time they had ever experienced problems getting their pensions on time. One former public sector worker, Eric Van Wijk of Indooroopilly in Queensland, likened the effects of the glitch to a Euro-style crisis. \"No pension on Thursday morning,\" the CSS fund member told Fairfax. \"I thought I was in Greece.\" Fairfax has been told that ComSuper was dogged by resignations in the lead-up to the merger, which was designed to cut red tape, with its finance section hit particularly hard. Morale among the remaining ComSuper public servants is said to be low as they adjust to the culture of the agency which has \"taken over\" their workplace. \"This is the first pension payday since the takeover,\" one insider said. \"Off to a flying start, clearly.\" Fund members were told late last month that the merged agency managing their pension was part of \"the Smaller Government agenda which aims to reduce the total number of government entities by eliminating duplication and overlap and by simplifying inefficient and complex agency structures.\" Finance Minister Mathias Cormann The CSC said on Friday that \"99 per cent\" of pensions should have been paid and that it hoped to process the remaining payments overnight. But retirees who had suffered financially because the debacle, which was being blamed on CSC's bankers Westpac, were told to approach their own banks for redress before taking their problems with their own super funds. The agency did not respond to a request for interview or to questions about staffing issues. Labor was sharpening its attack on the government over services last week with Shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh saying the ATO's problems were an example of ordinary people suffering as a result of the Coalition's policies towards the public service. Taxpayers will not have to pay $67,000 for massage and osteopathy therapy for a former public servant who has post traumatic stress disorder after an argument with her boss in a lift in Canberra six years ago. The ex-Health Department worker has lost a legal bid to have federal workplace insurer Comcare fund the ongoing treatment, with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal finding the therapy did not constitute \"reasonable\" spending. The case is the latest example of courts or tribunals backing Comcare's get-tough policy on the type of treatments it will fund for injured public servants. The woman's case, that the treatment was the only way she had found to help with the excruciating physical symptoms of her psychiatric problems, failed to sway the two tribunal members. The tribunal heard the woman had been working in Health and Ageing for four years when an \"unpleasant relationship developed\" with her boss. The trouble came to a head with a confrontation between the two in an office lift on July 21, 2009. She went off work soon afterwards, and a claim for workers' compensation for \"adjustment reaction with anxious mood\" was made in August of 2009. Another condition, post traumatic stress disorder, was accepted the following year. The former departmental staffer had 145 massages between 2010 and 2014, most of which were funded by Comcare at cost of $7860, and another 23 sessions with a chiropractor or osteopath. But in early 2014, the insurer decided it was no longer going to pay for the therapies, arguing they were not helping the woman get better or back to work and she has been paying for her own massages ever since. Appealing the decision to the tribunal, the woman said the therapies provided great benefits both in relieving muscle tension and contributing to relaxation and mental well being. She said her physical symptoms were severe, including her hands going numb, painful and swelling up, making it hard to perform everyday tasks, her jaw and face tensing up, and teeth grinding at night. Comcare's legal team calculated the future cost of the complementary therapies to the taxpayer-funded scheme at more than $67,000, with the woman's barrister Leo Grey arguing the figure was irrelevant. Mr Grey said his client was entitled to be compensated for treatment that allowed her to function physically while her underlying psychiatric problems were addressed. But tribunal members Gary Humphries and Bernard Hughson found the weight of recent case law was against the former Health employee, who is considered unlikely to ever go back to work. \"An impressive body of medical literature was cited before the tribunal which we think demonstrates very amply that massage and chiropractic/osteopathy does not constitute – in the view of mainstream psychology and psychiatry – effective treatment for curing or relieving psychological injuries,\" the members wrote in their decision. \"We find that the massage and osteopathy treatment, the costs of which are claimed by [the applicant], though it qualifies ... as medical treatment obtained in relation to her injury, is not reasonable treatment obtained in relation to that injury.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Tell me if this sounds familiar: someone you know does or says something that really bothers you (maybe it’s a coworker who talks down to you at work, or a friend who always brings their significant other to what you thought was going to be the two of you), and instead of talking about the issue directly with the other person, you talk about it with everybody on the planet except that person—and then get more and more frustrated when their behavior doesn’t change. If this sounds familiar, then you’re probably the way I was for the majority of my 20s—terrified of interpersonal conflict and completely unsure how to broach interpersonal issues like a grown up. Conflict sucks, right? No wonder we mostly try to avoid it. Then, one day, when I was complaining about the behavior of a coworker yet again to an older and wiser friend, she finally just said, “Well nothing’s going to change by talking to me about it. Don’t complain unless you’ve actually tried to fix it.” It was so simple, and yet so true (even if it’s not exactly what I wanted to hear). The person I had a problem with wasn’t a mindreader—they were likely completely unaware what they were doing was even bothering me, and if I didn’t figure out a way to discuss it with them honestly, nothing would ever get better. I made a decision to strive to be honest when I have a fixable problem with another person, and I’ve found that the vast majority of the time, people respond well to a candid, courteous conversation and try their best to work with you on the issue at hand. So that being said, here are a few things I’ve learned over the years about the best way to approach interpersonal issues, even if you’re the kind of person who totally dreads it: Address an issue early on Letting an interpersonal conflict go on for too long will not only stress you out for longer than it needs to, but it can potentially damage a relationship that would otherwise have been healthy and positive if only the issue had been resolved sooner. Not only that, but the more annoyed you allow yourself to get, the more likely you are to get passive aggressive, or even lose your temper and end up broaching the issue in a way that you didn’t intend. Don’t bring up the subject when you’re upset or angry This is super important. Broaching a subject when you’re angry will likely just put the other person on the defensive and will make it very difficult for them to actually be receptive to what you’re trying to say. You also want to be sure that you’re communicating what you mean respectfully—especially if you’re saying something that could be interpreted as a criticism (for example, a roommate who talks on the phone at maximum volume when you’re trying to sleep, or a friend who is perpetually late for everything, even when it’s important). Think about how you’re going to say what’s on your mind ahead of time, and imagine how you would like it said to you if the situation was reversed. Do it privately Wait to discuss the issue when you know you and the other person will have some alone time and won’t be constantly interrupted. It will not only show them that you want to have a meaningful discussion, but it will ensure that you have the time and space to really get to the bottom of the issue at hand. Plus, no one wants to be called out on something in front of other people, and doing so might get the discussion off on the wrong foot right away. Keep it friendly Again, people are rarely receptive if they are on the defense, and will often argue for the sake of arguing if they feel another person is coming at them with aggression (at the end of the day we’re all just human). If you really want someone to hear what you’re saying, try your best to keep it friendly and conversational. There’s that phrase “10 percent of conflict is due to difference of opinion, 90 percent is the tone of voice you use,” and I have found this to be so incredibly true in both my personal and professional life. I have seen so many interactions that could have potentially been positive end on a negative note, and it all had to do with the way a subject was broached and the tone of the person initiating the conversation. Thank that person for hearing you out This sounds kind of cheesy, but after someone hears you out and seems receptive to what you had to say, don’t be shy about thanking them. Maybe send them a quick e-mail with a link to something you know they’ll find funny, or an article about something you’ve both been talking about. It might not seem like a big deal, but a quick inside joke or friendly message goes a long way in reestablishing a sense of normalcy and easing any potential lingering tension. So hopefully these tips will be helpful to those of you trying to work up the courage to deal with conflict. Sometimes it can be really hard to swallow your pride or annoyance and keep it friendly, but if your purpose is to truly have a dialogue and be heard, and not just get in a fight or “give them a piece of your mind,” then I promise this will help. And it’s a true step towards being a grown up—no matter what your age.

If you've ever experienced the sensory explosion that is St. Paul's Carnival in the city you'll have an idea what I'm on about… The Minirig is built on solid foundations of great sound, ease-of-use and long life. That tight focus has enabled Minirig to produce a portable speaker that does only what you need it to do, but does it brilliantly. The unassuming little device has a solitary 3-inch driver and a single button. That does make it a resolutely mono device on its own, but also means it has been able to pack in that large speaker for serious sound. There are two analogue inputs too, for high and low-gain playback, and a power I/O for battery charging. This 2015 Bluetooth Minirig, as the name suggests, also comes with Bluetooth connectivity. It's the top spec too, with Bluetooth 4.0 and aptX to allow for CD-quality playback from a compatible wirelessly connected device. That's perfect for playing from a hi-res audio player or a streaming service like Tidal. I've got to make special mention of the battery in this thing though. The Minirig isn't particularly big by portable audio standards, and it's not that heavy either, but this thing packs in a battery with a completely unprecedented maximum 50 hours battery life. That's a full weekend of audio fun. Link-ups One of the things that's helped the Minirig gain popularity among the sound system crews is its ability to connect up to multiple versions of itself to boost sound. Daisy chain the analogue cables, if you find it a friend, and you can make with some big audio dynamite. PASCE knows this and has made sure the new Bluetooth Minirig will talk with older versions too, making sure no-one gets left out. As well as being able to link up a whole bunch of the little speakers themselves (Minirig fans are in fact attempting to create a world record with 100 of them to blow the ears off Bristol this Summer…) you can also boost the bass with a dedicated subwoofer too. That's a fair bit larger than the main Minirig, and if you go for a 2.1 setup the portability thing does start to become a little trickier to manage. The Bluetooth Minirig is a rather stunning piece of portable audio tech. The sound you get out of that 3-inch speaker is seriously impressive, being both very loud and clear too. Even at its loudest - and boy, does it get loud - you don't fear distortion and with aptX offering CD-quality playback from Tidal you get great sound reproduction too. For such a small device it really does pack a lot of bass when needed, even without the separate subwoofer. A brief touch of the power button, when the device is turned on, allows you to switch between high and low gain modes, which offers two levels of volume though that obviously does affect the battery life. That solitary button is super smart too. As well as powering on and switching modes, it also acts as a battery indicator via its multicoloured LED. When the device is off you can check the battery with a quick press - it then lights up five different colours to indicate how much juice is left in the tanks. Pairing it with a Bluetooth device is as simple as can be - the Minirig just appears when you search and you can immediately connect and go. Impressively it also uses TWS (true wireless stereo), if you have a pair of the Bluetooth Minirigs, so you can go completely wireless and still have both speakers playing the same audio from your Bluetooth device. This was the only time I experienced any technical difficulties though. Very, very occasionally I had the audio briefly drop for a fraction of a second. It was only when using the TWS setup though, which is down to the Bluetooth protocol and not the hardware. You can still wirelessly connect to one and have that wired into another for a completely flawless stereo effect. PASCE has also created an Android app for the speakers which is in open beta at the moment. Like the Minirig itself it's incredibly simple, with basic necessities like battery power and connection readouts. It's also here that you can switch between mono and stereo Bluetooth TWS playback with a pair of connected speakers. I love the simple, but effective, approach the Minirig has taken. There's no plethora of buttons or features to complicate matters. It's all about great, loud sound and the ability to keep going for ages. And that battery is amazing. The 50 hours battery life is achievable if you're keeping to relatively low volumes, with it sat in your kitchen, for example. But during normal, outdoor use, you are looking more at around 30 hours. Considering most Bluetooth speakers get super-excited about being able to offer ten hours that's still hugely impressive stuff. I've taken the Bluetooth Minirig away for camping weekends and it's been an absolute star, powering chilled music throughout the afternoon and pounding bass away until the wee hours when jolly dancing needed to happen. And when I got home the battery was still barely under 50%. Current page: Performance Previous Page Introduction and features Next Page Verdict Go to page: The Minirig may not be the most well-known device around, but it really deserves a lot more recognition; it packs a whole lot of impressive portable audio tech into a small, great-sounding package. Add in the Bluetooth aptX functionality, the seemingly endless link-up possibilities and capacious battery and you've got a quality little speaker. We liked First and foremost the audio quality is excellent. All the way up and down the volume slider the sound stays crisp and clear. The connectivity is great too, offering both wired and wireless capabilities along with its daisy-chaining link-up lovin'. I love the fact it's so simple too, which is great for ease-of-use, but also makes the Minirig a wonderfully subtle, unassuming thing aesthetically too. And that battery, oh, that battey…being able to take it away for a full weekend without needing to charge is great - in fact you can even use it to charge your other devices via USB too. We disliked I've thought long and hard about this, but the only negative I can really say about it is that £140 is a fair chunk of cash. But considering what you get for that I'd say it's still money well spent. The only techie niggle came from the TWS setup, and even that was very intermittent and hardly experience-destroying either. Okay, there is also the fact it's only a mono speaker, which might be an issue if you're trying to create an audio soundscape for a movie, but for blasting out the tunes in the park not so much. Verdict I've been using the Bluetooth Minirig for a good while now and I can still barely find fault with it. Genuinely it's the best portable speaker I've used, in terms of both its volume, sound quality and battery life. I dig the style, the simplicity and the sound - it's the wireless speaker that's always on in my kitchen and is always going to be in my bag when I travel. I can totally see why it's got such a cult following. Current page: Verdict Previous Page Performance",

Authorities had kept the airports closed early Saturday due to a new volcanic eruption of Mount Raung, in East Java, on Friday. Mount Raung, which first erupted earlier this month, is about 150 kilometers (94 miles) west of Bali. Hundreds flights in and out of the two Indonesian resort islands had been canceled since Thursday evening, stranding passengers and disrupting local businesses at the peak of the summer holiday season. Bali airport normally handles about 48,000 passengers daily, while Lombok airport serves about 3,600. The two island’s economies are heavily dependent on tourism, a sector the Indonesian government is relying on to bring foreign exchange into the country amid a slump in its commodity-heavy exports. Indonesia is home to dozens of active volcanoes that sit along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanic eruptions sometimes disrupt flights in the country, but have never been linked to aviation accidents.",

Jilly from Philly is played by the film’s producer, Jerry Weintraub. 9. Weintraub’s connections helped him shoot in one Vegas’s swankiest hotels. The production was granted access to the Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas because Weintraub was close friends with Steve Wynn, the billionaire who owned the Mirage at the time. 10. Fans of classic Nickelodeon might recognize the fake I.D. salesman and Frank Sinatra impersonator. He’s played by Toby Huss, aka Artie the Strongest Man in the World from The Adventures of Pete \u0026 Pete. 11. Wayne Newton’s house in the movie is actually Wayne Newton’s house in real life. Called “Casa de Shenandoah,” the property went up for auction in 2013 for $70 million. 12. The cast boasts more than one Saturday Night Live alum. The reception desk employee at the Mirage is played by Julia Sweeney, who appeared on Saturday Night Live from 1990-1994. Chevy Chase famously appeared in the original SNLcast from 1975-1976. 13. This is the third Vacation movie to incorporate Lindsay Buckingham’s song “Holiday Road.” It was left out of Christmas Vacation. 14. Clark plays a number of fake games with Uncle Eddie at the rundown casino. Pick a Number Between 1-10; Coin Toss; War; Rock, Paper, Scissors; and Guess Which Hand were all made up.

The appearance by the trio - who played Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo in the original Star Wars films - sent the crowd of thousands into meltdown. All three are reprising their roles in Episode VII: The Force Awakens, which will hit cinemas this Christmas. Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford appear at Comic-Con International in San Diego. Photo: Getty Images In one of the most anticipated events at this year's Comic-Con, the trio took part in a Star Wars-themed panel also featuring Episode VII director J.J. Abrams and the head of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy. The panel was held in the San Diego Convention Centre's biggest space, Hall H. Some fans camped out for days to be at the front of the queue. Fisher said the cast and crew of the new Star Wars movies referred to her, Ford and Hamill, as \"the legacy people\". \"I'm fine\": ... Harrison Ford. Photo: Getty Images \"It was like a flashback,\" Fisher said. \"I didn't think it was going to happen again. It was a long leave off, and now we're back.\" \"I'm fine,\" Ford, 72, said when he took to the stage, referring to his involvement in a recent light plane crash. \"It should have felt ridiculous, [but] it felt great,\" Ford said of returning to the character of Han Solo, and the Star Wars \"universe\". \"I wasn't so sure it would,\" he added. \"But the company was great. The director was the right director. And I was proud to once again be involved.\" Ford noted that the original Star Wars film was the launching pad for his career. \"I was very, very grateful of the opportunity I had in that film,\" he said. \"I never thought that we would do another. I read something that I thought was really remarkable, really well-written, and with some very intriguing developments. So I was delighted to be involved.\" The panel also featured other members of the new cast, including John Boyega (who plays a stormtrooper named Finn), Daisy Ridley (who plays a female scavenger named Rey) and Oscar Isaac (who plays a pilot named Poe Dameron). Boyega, Ridley and Isaac's characters will lead the story in Episode VII: The Force Awakens. Also appearing were the film's \"villains\", Adam Driver (who plays Kylo Ren), Domhnall Gleeson (who plays General Hux) and Gwendoline Christie (who stars as Captain Phasma). Although there is little detail about the film and its characters, it is universally understood that Kylo Ren is the main villain, and is the black-shrouded figure seen in the film's trailer wielding a \"cross-bladed\" lightsaber. Driver, however, gave little away. \"We didn't have a lot of conversations about bad or evil,\" Driver said of his conversations with director J.J. Abrams. \"It was more about the difference between being bad and being right, which is a huge difference.\" Kennedy confirmed the next three \"trilogy\" films would continue the story of Star Wars, and would be badged as episodes VII, VIII and IX. Lucasfilm is also working on three standalone films, the first of which, Star Wars: Rogue One, starts shooting in three weeks. It will focus on the theft of the Death Star plans, an event immediately preceding the original 1977 Star Wars film. The second standalone film was confirmed last week as a Han Solo \"origin story\". The Australian production company Working Dog has sold its critically acclaimed comedy series to the US streaming service Netflix. The deal effectively exposes the series to an audience of more 45 million viewers. The series, created by Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner, is a comedy series set within the Nation Building Authority, a fictitious government organisation responsible for overseeing major infrastructure projects. It stars Sitch, Celia Pacquola, Dave Lawson, Luke McGregor, Kitty Flanagan and Toby Truslove. The first series of Utopia was aired on ABC1 in 2014 and won the TV Week Logie Award for most outstanding comedy series.The second series launches on the ABC in August. To avoid confusion with the British thriller Utopia and the US reality series Utopia, the series will be re-titled Dreamland in both markets. The deal was hammered out between the UK-based DCD Rights, which manages Working Dog's catalogue internationally, and Netflix's US head office in California's Silicon Valley. Under the terms of the deal, the US and UK-based streaming services operated by Netflix will play the first two seasons of the series. The first series will launch on Netflix in the US and UK later this year; the second season will be made available to Netflix subscribers in those markets after it airs on the ABC. Netflix reports a 65.5 million global subscriber base, of which 42.3 million are in the US market. According to reports Netflix's UK subscriber base is estimated at around 4.5 million. \"We are incredibly excited to be part of the Netflix phenomenon,\" Working Dog principal Michael Hirsh said. \"And we are extremely flattered that they are running the original version, the Australian version,\" he said. In a separate deal with Netflix, Working Dog has also sold the series to the Australia and New Zealand-based Netflix platforms. It is expected to be available on the Netflix streaming platform in those markets later this year.

    "DiffbotBody": "TBWA\\Chiat\\Day's \"Made in NY\" spot for Gatorade starring Derek Jeter won the Grand Clio Sports award for film at the Clio Sports ceremony in New York last night. It was one of nine awards presented for creative excellence in sports. The ceremony also featured the presentation of a Lifetime Achievement Award in memory of the late ESPN anchor Stuart Scott. ESPN's Scott Van Pelt presented the award to Scott's family, and starting next year, the honor will be renamed the Stuart Scott Lifetime Achievement Award. At the ceremony, Susan Scott, Stuart's sister, unveiled the Stuart O. Scott Foundation, which will launch in October. It is, she said, \"his vision from his hospital bed\" and will focus on \"caring for cancer fighters in their everyday struggle to lead a normal life, in exactly the way that he was able to.\" The other Grand Clio Sports award winners were: \"805 Million Names,\" by Sweden's Forsman \u0026 Bodenfors for the United Nations World Food Programme, won in two categories: public relations and partnerships, and sponsorships and endorsements. \"Bacon,\" by Venables Bell \u0026 Partners for Reebok, won for design. \"Subzero,\" by Miami Ad School for REI, won for student out-of-home. \"The Pursuit,\" by R/GA for Equinox, won for innovative. \"The Inverted Jersey,\" by Brazil's Africa agency for Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, won for engagements/experiential. \"Hockey Heaven,\" by Canada's Rethink for Molson Canada, won for digital/social. \"Daytona 500 Bus Wraps—Go Daddy,\" by Fox Sports Marketing for Fox Sports, won for out-of-home. Former New York Giants running back Tiki Barber hosted the awards, which were presented during a gala dinner at Cipriani 42nd Street. Founded in 1959, the Clios are international awards competitions held throughout the year for creative professionals in advertising, sports, fashion, music, entertainment and health care. The Clio Sports awards debuted last year. Gatorade received the inaugural Clio Sports Brand Icon Award, which recognizes one brand that has become a permanent fixture in popular culture. Mark Tatum, the NBA's deputy commissioner and COO, presented the award to Brett O'Brien, svp and gm of Gatorade and Propel. The full list of gold, silver and bronze winners across 17 categories was announced in June.

It was one of nine awards presented for creative excellence in sports. The ceremony also featured the presentation of a Lifetime Achievement Award in memory of the late ESPN anchor Stuart Scott. ESPN's Scott Van Pelt presented the award to Scott's family, and starting next year, the honor will be renamed the Stuart Scott Lifetime Achievement Award. At the ceremony, Susan Scott, Stuart's sister, unveiled the Stuart O. Scott Foundation, which will launch in October. It is, she said, \"his vision from his hospital bed\" and will focus on \"caring for cancer fighters in their everyday struggle to lead a normal life, in exactly the way that he was able to.\" The other Grand Clio Sports award winners were: Former New York Giants running back Tiki Barber hosted the awards, which were presented during a gala dinner at Cipriani 42nd Street.

    "DiffbotBody": "The ESPY Awards are television network ESPN‘s way of acknowledging best sports-related performances of the past year. Whether it be an accomplishment by an individual or a shining moment from a team, the ESPYs are here to recognize — and pay tribute to — the impressive achievements put forth by some of the greatest athletes on the planet. And we can’t help but find it pretty entertaining. For a sports fan, it’s not everyday you get to witness all your favorite athletes gathered in one place, interacting, sharing laughs, and reliving some of the year’s crown moments in the world of sports. We’re talking about the those who made the sickest catches on the gridiron or the ones who nailed the smoothest jumpers on the hardwood. The players who embraced the challenge, overcame the obstacles, and became a part of history. The winners, the losers, the role models, the heroes — we can’t help but feel a connection with them all. Why is that? Well, why do we watched sports? Simple: To be inspired. On Wednesday evening, this year’s event — hosted by Joel McHale — took place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles and, once again, all the major stars came out for the affair. With tons of athletes honored for their incredible achievements, some victors managed to stand out among the rest. With that in mind, here’s your Cheat Sheet to the big winners from the 2015 ESPY Awards. Best Male Athlete Winner: Stephen Curry Nominees: Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Aaron Rodgers, J.J. Watt Before he walked off the stage after accepting the Best Male Athlete Award, Stephen Curry couldn’t help but crack a little joke about his victory. “You know, I never imagined myself standing on this stage holding this award,” Curry said. “I’m 6-foot-3, 180 pounds soaking wet. It’s really nice to be called an athlete once in a while. Thank you very much.” As much as we enjoyed the self-deprecation on the part of the Golden State superstar, here are some other numbers to take into consideration: 23.8 points per game, 91.4% free-throw percentage, 286 total three pointers, one three-point shooting crown, and one MVP award. Those are just a few figures that represent the kind of year Curry had during the 2014-15 NBA season. Along with his unrivaled shooting stroke, sweet handle, and affinity for flare, the Baby-Faced Assassin led the Warriors to their first championship in 40 years. When it comes to Curry’s skill on the basketball court, there is nothing to laugh about. The guy is slowly emerging as the next face of the NBA — and he is more than deserving of his 2015 ESPY Award. Best Championship Performance Winner: LeBron James Nominees: LeBron James, American Pharoah, Madison Bumgarner, Lauren Haeger LeBron James may not have won the 2015 NBA Finals, but that’s not what most folks are going to remember. They’ll remember a guy who took a bunch of reserve players and led them to within two wins of toppling one of the best teams the NBA has ever seen. They’ll remember a superhuman showing that doesn’t come around everyday. They’ll remember a guy who put up 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game and cemented his legacy among the greatest players in NBA history. They’ll remember why he was called the King. The other nominees on the list won their respective championships. One even managed to become the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years. Yet what James did in these past Finals was transcendent. He took his game to an entirely new level and he took us along for the ride. There was no greater performance than that. Best Team Winner: U.S. Women’s Soccer Nominees: U.S. Women’s Soccer, New England Patriots, Connecticut Huskies, Golden State Warriors, Chicago Blackhawks, Ohio State Buckeyes After showing guts, determination, and incredible desire, the United States Women’s National Soccer Team finally won the World Cup title that had eluded the squad since 1999. But this team did more than just take home the sport’s biggest trophy, they united a nation. And it doesn’t get more powerful than that. Team leader Abby Wambach was more than aware of the impact this team has had on America. She made sure to acknowledge such during the team’s acceptance speech after being honored with the 2015 ESPY for Best Team. “You guys believed in us the entire seven games, since four years ago when we fell short to 10 days ago when we won it,” Wambach said. “We lifted the trophy. We did this for American and our fans. You guys are the best. We love you so much.” It would seem the feeling’s mutual. Arthur Ashe Award for Courage Recipient: Caitlyn Jenner For those who have a hard time believing was worthy of being the , her acceptance speech more than showcased her overall bravery. “If you want to call me names, make jokes and doubt my intentions, go ahead, because the reality is I can take it,” said Jenner. “But for thousands of kids out there coming to terms with the reality of who they are, they shouldn’t have to take it.” Say what you will, but the Arthur Ashe Award is about more than just being courageous. It’s about acceptance and tolerance. It’s about compassion and hope and inclusion. Jenner not only won the Decathlon, but was portrayed as the epitome of masculinity. Yet, all that was a facade — for most of her life, Jenner was living a lie. And now here she was, putting herself out there, being honest with the public, and trying to raise awareness for an important cause. On a night filled with big moments, this one stands alone among the rest. To see the complete list of winners from the 2015 ESPYs, click here. Want more great content like this?

    "DiffbotBody": "The Drive-By Truckers' Patterson Hood called for a reclamation and celebration of Southern heritage, minus the Confederate battle flag and all it represents, in an insightful, biographical essay for The New York Times Magazine. A native of Florence, Alabama, Hood grew up in a traditional, conservative community known as The Shoals that was steeped in the region's musical history. W.C. Handy called it home, Sam Phillips hailed from a town nearby and Hood's father, David, played bass in the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which recorded countless soul and R\u0026B hits at FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. \"Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, the Staple Singers, Bobby Womack and many other African-American artists crossed racial barriers and recorded classic music with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, who happened to be white,\" Hood wrote. \"Together, they recorded landmark hits that were the soundtrack of the Civil Rights Movement.\" Hood recalled how these experiences shaped his father's view of the world, and noted the progressive streak of his grandparents and great-uncle. Yet amongst their stories of the Depression were tales about Hood's great-great-grandfather, a non-slave-owning Confederate soldier who fought at Shiloh to protect his land from invaders. Despite these stories, and coming of age in the wake of the Civil Rights movement, Hood admitted his young-adult concerns were more frivolous (girls, rock concerts). The Confederate flag could be seen as a backdrop at a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert, \"but beyond that it wasn't really anything any of us thought much about at the time.\" But as he got older and began writing songs, Hood started dissecting what he called \"the duality of the Southern thing\" on \"The Southern Thing,\" off Drive-By Truckers' beloved 2001 LP, Southern Rock Opera. \"The album,\" Hood wrote, \"wrestled with how to be proud of where we came from while acknowledging and condemning the worst parts of our region's history.\" Still, his lyrics were often misconstrued, and at DBT shows, fans would wave Confederate flags during \"The Southern Thing.\" The band rarely plays it now for that reason. Hood closed out his essay lauding the South Carolina legislature for voting to remove the Confederate flag from the state house after the racially motivated shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. He said he hoped other states would follow suit, and that the tired, ineffective argument \"heritage, not hate\" would fall away, too. \"If we want to truly honor our Southern forefathers, we should do it by moving on from the symbols and prejudices of their time and building on the diversity, the art and the literary traditions we’ve inherited from them,\" Hood wrote, adding: \"It’s time to quit rallying around a flag that divides. And it is time for the South to — dare I say it? — rise up and show our nation what a beautiful place our region is, and what more it could become.\" 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Strike up the band! The resistance band that is. Whether you are on the road, or barricaded in your home recovering from the death of your favorite Game of Thrones character, a total body workout is always accessible due to the portability and convenience of the resistance band. These flexible flab fighters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making them perfect for your daily exercise routine or assisted stretching (or to sling shot water balloons at that noisy neighbor). Here’s how to make the most of this one-man resistance band show: Chest to Impress. Find a sturdy support beam or column and evenly wrap your band around it at shoulder height. With your back turned away from the supporting structure, grab each handle and take a large step forward. The beauty of the band is that you can adjust its resistance simply by removing slack from the tube. The further you step away from the column, the harder the exercise becomes. With palms at shoulder height, push through your chest until your arms are completely extended. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions. Reverse Gears. The next exercise requires a similar setup, however you will be facing your support column rather than having your back to it. With a handle in each hand, take a big step backwards while pulling your hands in towards either side of your ribcage. Bring your feet back to center, and perform the same exercise with the opposite foot. The reverse lunge row is a powerful movement in that it targets major muscle groups and aids in bettering your balance. Balancing exercises should be incorporated into every workout routine, as they are crucial in strengthening your core, improving the integrity of your spine and preventing injuries from falls. Complete 15 repetitions per side. Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head. Crank out 12-15 repetitions. Repeat each exercise 3-5 times to guarantee a good burn, baby burn. Sometimes the best cure in the fight against fat is to apply a little resistance band-aid. Earn it.

    "LabBody": "Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head.

But since they’ve made it clear that they aren’t ready to work on whatever is keeping them apart, Cole has managed to find herself in an even worse situationship with Bryan “Birdman” Williams since her marriage started falling apart. She went from fighting other women for him, to grinding on pianos on Instagram for the 45-year-old record producer and entrepreneur. In both cases, I think Cole thought she had found individuals who actually understood her and would treat her right, but alas, people aren’t always what they seem. So now that she’s had time to process some of her decisions when it comes to her relationships, she’s making some changes. She’s allowed her mother, Frankie, and her siblings, including sisters Neffeteria and Elite, back in her life after not being on the best of terms. She’s also going about dating in a different way. According to Cole, she’s going to abstain from sex. It’s unclear for how long, but she seems ready and willing to wait after all her heart has been through: Can you relate to Cole’s decision?

    "LabBody": "From EatingWell: March/April 2008 The secret to a good cream sauce is always the same: not too much cream or it can be overpowering, masking the more delicate flavors. Here it contains a bountiful amount of mushrooms and is served over chicken breasts. Makes: 2 servings. Active Time: 30 minutes. Total Time: 30 minutes. Ingredients. 2 5-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and tenders removed (see Tip) 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper. 1/4 teaspoon salt. 1 tablespoon canola oil. 1 medium shallot, minced. 1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushroom caps. 2 tablespoons dry vermouth, or dry white wine. 1/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth. 2 tablespoons heavy cream. 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives, or scallion greens. Preparation. Season chicken with pepper and salt on both sides. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning once or twice and adjusting the heat to prevent burning, until brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165°F, 12 to 16 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Add shallot to the pan and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in vermouth (or wine); simmer until almost evaporated, scraping up any browned bits, about 1 minute. Pour in broth and cook until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cream and chives (or scallions); return to a simmer. Return the chicken to the pan, turn to coat with sauce and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Tips \u0026 Notes. Tip: It's difficult to find an individual chicken breast small enough for one portion. Removing the thin strip of meat from the underside of a 5-ounce breast—the “tender”—removes about 1 ounce of meat and yields a perfect 4-ounce portion. Wrap and freeze the tenders and when you have gathered enough, use them in a stir-fry or for oven-baked chicken fingers. Nutrition.

    "DiffbotBody": "A brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal walk into a school library…. Within the first 60 seconds of The Breakfast Club, John Hughes managed to successfully introduce the five high school archetypes he would spend the next hour and a half dismantling, or at least redefining. Upon its release 30 years ago, it would have been easy to dismiss it as just another teen comedy about stock adolescent problems, i.e. does he like me, or does he like me like me? And while that exact question may have been a central plot point in Hughes' Sixteen Candles, which hit theaters less than a year before TBC, the late, great, Chicago-loving auteur decided to use this follow-up to turn the genre on its head. Set more like a stage play — \"It's like 12 Angry Men,\" Gossip Girl co-creator Stephanie Savage exclaims — the film sees a quintet of high schoolers who, for various reasons, are forced to spend a Saturday morning detention in each other's company. Instead, they end up dancing on tabletops, holding an impromptu group therapy session and altering the social hierarchy of Shermer High — Bender the burnout (Judd Nelson) gets Claire the prom queen (Molly Ringwald), school weirdo Allison (Ally Sheedy) hooks up with head jock Andrew (Emilio Estevez), and the lovable academic overachiever Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) realizes that he's not so different after all. (Should you need a refresher, a new Blu-Ray edition of the film hits shelves on March 10th; it's also getting a two-nights-only theatrical re-release on March 26th and 31st.) Whether or not these newfound friendships, romances, and bromances lasted through Monday's homeroom is unknown. But what is for certain is that virtually every creator and consumer of adolescent-focused entertainment in the three decades since the film's debut owes a huge debt of gratitude to Hughes for turning teenagers into young adults. Just ask Y.A. novelist phenomenon — and one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in 2014 — John Green (The Fault in Our Stars, Looking for Alaska); Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody (Juno, Young Adult); actor-comedian Paul Scheer (The League); and Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who have collectively produced and/or created some of the most popular teen series of the past decade (The O.C., Gossip Girl). They aren't exactly the Breakfast Club redux — more like two brains, two basket cases and a princess — but each one of them spoke with us about the movie's enduring impact. 2015 may not bring everything that Back to the Future II promised it would: flying cars, self-lacing shoes, we don't see 'em happening over the next 12 months. (Then again, don't bet against Nike.) But this year will definitely pack plenty of punch when it comes to cultural happenings. Mad Max will roar back out of the apocalypse while Mad Men rides off into the sunset, rock's Antichrist Superstar and hip-hop's Yeezus will rise again. There will be Beach Boys, Fall Out Boys, and screaming females – the last, both inside and outside screenings of Fifty Shades of Grey. With the caveat that all dates are subject to change, here are the music, movies and TV you need to know about all year long. Bernie Sanders is nominally a socialist, or at least he sorta-kinda calls himself one. \"Do they think I'm afraid of the word?\" he mused in a recent interview with The Nation. \"I'm not afraid of the word.\" When The Washington Post gave him the opportunity to disavow the epithet during his 2006 Senate run, Sanders stood firm: \"I wouldn't deny it,\" he said. \"Not for one second. I'm a democratic socialist.\" His affiliation has not escaped notice of Hillary Clinton's defenders. Sen. Claire McCaskill recently grumbled, \"I think that the media is giving Bernie a pass right now. I very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he's a socialist.\" In apparent violation of this supposed cover-up, The Daily Beast's Ana Marie Cox has labeled Sanders an \"extremist\" \"caricature\" who amounts to \"the Left's Trump.\" The Week's Damon Linker was also tempted by the Sanders-Trump comparison, calling them \"unelectable radicals,\" and noting that Sanders \"shows little interest in tailoring his message to woo the masses.\" Yet, despite his inescapable affiliation with the s-word – long considered a politically fatal liability – and his reported contempt for the masses' sensibilities, Sanders continues to draw enormous crowds, outpace Hillary Clinton in attracting small donations and generate great enthusiasm, even among groups conventional wisdom doggedly insists will refuse to embrace his candidacy. That these throngs – energized by Sanders' egalitarian economic advocacy, support for worker empowerment and hostility to what he calls \"the billionaire class\" – are not noticeably put off by the description of these qualities as socialist, as opposed to merely \"progressive,\" raises the question: Why doesn't Sanders avail himself of this political latitude and run on a more socialistic policy program? For now, the proposals at the core of his platform – for the most part very good – are standard fare for progressive Democrats. Of the \"12 Steps Forward\" in his \"Agenda for America,\" none diverge from the policies advocated by Sanders' fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In fact, with the exception of \"Creating Worker Co-ops,\" \"Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\" and \"Health Care as a Right for All,\" none of the items would seem out of place in a stump speech or State of the Union address by President Obama. For now, this sort of platform constitutes the leftmost bounds of mainstream policy discourse, but there is plenty of room to stretch leftward through advocacy of \"non-reformist reforms\" – those that, in the words of French philosopher André Gorz, \"advance toward a radical transformation of society,\" producing a \"modification of the relations of power\" and thus \"serv[ing] to weaken capitalism and to shake its joints.\" On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage – to use one example from Sanders' platform – yields a host of advantages for working people, and plainly excites the opposition of the capitalist class, but it neither socializes ownership claims on capital, nor fundamentally changes the power relations between workers and owners, nor incites a process that yields equality as reliably as capitalism yields inequality. Raising the minimum wage is a defense against capitalists' perpetual imperative to intensify exploitation of labor by lowering wages, not an offense against the structures by which capitalists are able to do this. Running on a platform with a non-reformist reform at its core would serve Sanders' pro-equality political project, even if he should lose to Clinton and her mountains of corporate cash. Once one of these off-the-agenda items is named, articulated and argued for – once people are familiarized with a program's contours, rationale and merits – it is much easier to mobilize support for an idea. The Nader campaigns left behind them nothing so much as contempt for third party \"spoilers,\" the Kucinich campaigns not even that. People for Bernie (whose open letter encouraging Sanders to run I signed) may hope for an ongoing political organization, such as emerged from the insurgent candidacy of Sanders' fellow Vermonter, former Gov. Howard Dean. But it is fair to ask more. The more attention and enthusiasm his candidacy garners, the more favorable the terrain will be for Sanders to pry open the boundaries of policy consideration. This would provide a boost to the effort to agitate for a departure from capitalism, after what he calls his \"revolution\" concludes. Of the array of non-reformist reforms Sanders could adopt as key planks, the one that probably makes the most sense is a job guarantee, whose historical advocates have ranged from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King. Under this program, the federal government would act as the \"employer of last resort\"; it could hire the unemployed for its own national projects, funnel money to states and municipalities or let communities design their own projects and apply for funding. Guaranteeing public sector employment to anyone who wants to sign up would accomplish a lot of the goals Sanders trumpets. It would reduce inequality by eliminating unemployment and its resultant poverty. It would magnify worker power by providing an exit from the job market, thereby setting minimum standards for all sorts for private sector employment. It would eliminate employment discrimination, long a central pillar of structural racism, erasing the chief cause of recidivism. It would allow communities that currently rely on prisons to close them without toppling the local economy, thereby enabling the type of mass decarceration Sanders would do well to advocate forcefully, the better to make up for his recent blunder at Netroots Nation. It would promote ecological sustainability by making full employment independent of the resource extraction sector, by paying for low-emissions employment like elder- and childcare and by providing resources for pollution-reducing infrastructure renovation. It would guarantee dignified pay and conditions for so-called \"unskilled\" labor typically performed by women: domestic work, childcare and nursing. It would end reliance on increasingly expensive higher education as a prerequisite for employment. It would practically establish a public option for health care, since those availing themselves of the program would receive normal benefits for a federal employee. All these virtues, and the program would be fiscally sound on its own. It would grow the deficit permanently – an outcome Sanders has repeatedly, to his disgrace, maintained is undesirable – but never so far that inflation, the sole danger of too big a deficit, ensues: When the business cycle is down, the program would grow to bring us up to capacity, and when a boom threatens to inflate the economy, the program would automatically shrink. As long as the job guarantee wages are not competitive with the private sector, they should serve to anchor the general price level. Nor is this some bizarre, far-fetched idea that would hike Sanders' already uncomfortably high degree of Seeming Kooky: even without inclusion on the agenda of any mainstream political actors, a job guarantee already polls at 47 percent. Ironically, no one touts the merits of guaranteed public employment more vigorously than modern monetary theorists like Stephanie Kelton, the chief economist for the Democratic staff on the Sanders-chaired Senate Budget Committee. I took his hiring Kelton as a signal that Sanders was preparing to run for president on a job guarantee. So far, he has given no such indication, but there remain many excruciating months until the primaries; Sanders has plenty of time to earn more fully the label he says he's not afraid of.",

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

Serendipity 3 sundaes, anyone? July 4, 9:15 p.m. Cashman Field How about celebrating Independence Day with America’s favorite pastime? Cashman Field sets off its show right after the Las Vegas 51s take on the Albuquerque Isotopes. Baseball, hot dogs and a firework extravaganza—what’s more American than that? Bonus: A pre-game Family Fun Fest begins inside the Cashman Convention Center at 3 p.m. July 4, game begins at 7:05 p.m., $15-$25, Family Fun Fest free with game ticket. Fremont Street Experience Okay, there won’t be any real fireworks at Downtown’s canopy Friday and Saturday night, but a virtual fireworks display will follow each Viva Vision show between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. July 3-4. Green Valley Ranch Resort Don’t want to leave Henderson, but still want to catch some awesome fireworks? No problem! GVR lights the sky afire around 9 p.m. The \"We Love Locals Fireworks Blast\" lasts nine minutes and is simulcast on \"The Coyote\" KCYE 102.7 and \"The Star\" 107.9.

Directed by Maya Forbes. Rated R. Opens Friday. Around the time that his buddy and frequent collaborator Adam Sandler signed a multi-film, multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix, David Spade announced that he’d be making a sequel to his 2001 comedy Joe Dirt as an original movie for the free VOD service Crackle, and Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser plays like an even cheaper, lazier version of a typical Sandler movie. The slapdash plot finds mulleted redneck Joe Dirt (Spade) traveling back in time via a Wizard of Oz-style tornado, although the production is so barebones that its past looks suspiciously like the present. Most of the original supporting cast returns, but they all seem vaguely confused as to what they’re doing there. Spade and co-writer/director Fred Wolf beat every feeble joke into the ground, and the plot drags on interminably only to end up in the exact same place it started. You’d think that after 14 years, they’d have more than stale fart jokes and weak callbacks to bits that weren’t funny in the first place.",

Their foundation is like a French marriage – or their own: It works better if no one asks questions. However, in a rare feat of balanced journalism, the New York Times did ask some questions. The paper looked into the nefarious activities of the Clinton Foundation and came up with instances of influence peddling on a grand scale. The Times used the upcoming book “Clinton Cash,” by Peter Schweizer as a road map to determine that, while Hillary was secretary of state, the Clintons got money when she approved the sale of important U.S. uranium reserves to seedy foreigners, including Russia (read Vladimir Putin). Largely unaccounted for, the money flowed to the Clinton Foundation, with $500,000 going to Bill Clinton for a one-hour speech.

She is letting them know she is just like them and that she puts on her pantsuits one leg at a time. The staged wallowing with “average” Americans is compulsory behavior en route to the presidency. The goal is to get yourself to the Oval Office so you never have to mingle with ordinary folks again. Hillary is also letting them know she is smart – this from a woman who wants people to believe that she didn’t know she could get two email accounts (work and personal) on the same smartphone. Yep, she’s smart. She knows just how dumb her voters are, and what they will believe from her. Giving the Clintons the checkbook for a foundation is like giving your PIN to your alcoholic brother-in-law with a gambling problem who lives in your basement. Hillary famously said that she and Bill were not only broke, but in debt, when they left the White House. Yet, they had a nice, three-story, multimillion dollar home near New York City. The Clintons have always had three stories: the one they tell the press, the truth and the one they tell a grand jury.

    "DiffbotBody": "WASHINGTON — We need a pick me up. Amid the vandalizing of Palmyra, the imminent extinction of the northern white rhino, the disarray threatening Europe's most ambitious attempt ever at peaceful unification — amid plague and pestilence and, by God, in the middle of Shark Week — where can humanity turn for uplift? Meet New Horizons, arriving at Pluto on July 14. Small and light, the fastest spacecraft ever launched, it left Earth with such velocity that it shot past our moon in nine hours. A speeding bullet the size of a Steinway, it has flown 9 1/2 years to the outer edges of the solar system. To Pluto, the now-demoted \"dwarf planet\" that lives beyond the Original Eight in the far distant \"third zone\" of the solar system — the Kuiper Belt, an unimaginably huge ring of rocks and ice and sundry debris where the dwarf is king. After 3 billion miles, New Horizons will on Tuesday shoot right through Pluto's mini-planetary system of five moons, the magnificently named Charon, Styx, Nix, Hydra and Kerberos. Why through? Because, while the other planets lie on roughly the same plane, Pluto and its moon system stick up at an angle to that plane like a giant archery target. New Horizons gets one pass, going straight by the bull's-eye. No orbiting around, no lingering for months or even years to photograph and study. No mulligans. And no navigating. Can't do that when it takes 4 1/2 hours for a message from Earth to arrive. This is a preprogrammed, single-take, nine-day deal. For what? First, for the science, the coming avalanche of new knowledge. Remember: We didn't even know there was a Pluto until 85 years ago when astronomer Clyde Tombaugh found a strange tiny dot moving across the star field. Today, we still know practically nothing. In fact, two of the five moons were not discovered until after New Horizons was launched. And yet next week we will see an entirely new world come to life. \"We're not planning to rewrite any textbooks,\" said principal investigator Alan Stern in a splendid New York Times documentary on the mission. \"We're planning to write them from scratch.\" Then there's the romance. The Pluto fly-by caps a half-century of solar system exploration that has yielded staggering new wonders. Such as Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, with its vast subterranean ocean under a crust of surface ice, the most inviting potential habitat for extraterrestrial life that human beings will ever reach. class=\"bodytext\"\u003eYes, ever. Promising exoplanets — the ones circling distant stars that we deduce might offer a Goldilocks zone suitable for water-based life — are being discovered by the week. But they are unreachable. The journey to even the nearest would, at New Horizons speed, take 280,000 years. Even mere communication would be absurdly difficult. A single exchange of greetings — \"Hi there,\" followed by \"Back at you, brother\" — would take a generation. It's the galactic version of the old Trappist monastery joke where every seven years one monk at one meal is allowed one remark. A young novice arrives and after seven years a monk stands up at dinner and says: \"The soup is cold.\" Seven years of silence. Then another monk stands and says: \"The bread is stale.\" Seven years later, the now-aging novice rises and says: \"If you don't stop this bickering, I'm outta here.\" Which is what a conversation with Klingons would be like, except with longer intervals. Which is why we prefer to scour our own solar system. And for more than just the science, more than just the romance. Here we are, upright bipeds with opposable thumbs, barely down from the trees, until yesterday unable to fly, to communicate at a distance, to reproduce a sound or motion or even an image — and even today barely able to manage the elementary decencies of civilization — taking close-up pictures and chemical readings of a mysterious world 9 1/2 years away. One final touch. Every ounce of superfluous weight has been stripped from New Horizons to give it more speed and pack more instruments. Yet there was one concession to poetry. New Horizons is carrying some of Clyde Tombaugh's ashes. After all, he found the dot. Not only will he fly by his netherworldly discovery, notes Carter Emmart of the American Museum of Natural History, he will become the first human being to have his remains carried beyond the solar system. For the wretched race of beings we surely are, we do, on occasion, manage to soar. Charles Krauthammer's email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com.",

Meet New Horizons, arriving at Pluto on July 14. Small and light, the fastest spacecraft ever launched, it left Earth with such velocity that it shot past our moon in nine hours. A speeding bullet the size of a Steinway, it has flown 9 1/2 years to the outer edges of the solar system. To Pluto, the now-demoted \"dwarf planet\" that lives beyond the Original Eight in the far distant \"third zone\" of the solar system — the Kuiper Belt, an unimaginably huge ring of rocks and ice and sundry debris where the dwarf is king. After 3 billion miles, New Horizons will on Tuesday shoot right through Pluto's mini-planetary system of five moons, the magnificently named Charon, Styx, Nix, Hydra and Kerberos. Why through? Because, while the other planets lie on roughly the same plane, Pluto and its moon system stick up at an angle to that plane like a giant archery target. New Horizons gets one pass, going straight by the bull's-eye. No orbiting around, no lingering for months or even years to photograph and study. No mulligans. And no navigating. Can't do that when it takes 4 1/2 hours for a message from Earth to arrive. This is a preprogrammed, single-take, nine-day deal. For what? First, for the science, the coming avalanche of new knowledge. Remember: We didn't even know there was a Pluto until 85 years ago when astronomer Clyde Tombaugh found a strange tiny dot moving across the star field. Today, we still know practically nothing. In fact, two of the five moons were not discovered until after New Horizons was launched. And yet next week we will see an entirely new world come to life. \"We're not planning to rewrite any textbooks,\" said principal investigator Alan Stern in a splendid New York Times documentary on the mission. \"We're planning to write them from scratch.\" Then there's the romance. The Pluto fly-by caps a half-century of solar system exploration that has yielded staggering new wonders. Such as Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, with its vast subterranean ocean under a crust of surface ice, the most inviting potential habitat for extraterrestrial life that human beings will ever reach.",

Read More [Editor’s Note: Be sure to join IGN and Harmonix for the world gameplay premiere of Rock Band 4 in our live stream on Friday, May 15 at 12pm PT/3pm ET/7pm GMT. That's 5am AEST on Saturday.] Many would agree that Rock Band 2 was the peak of Rock Band’s campaign design. Rock Band 4 aims to outperform the 2008 game’s limited story elements and band interaction with a simple, strong new feature: Gigs. “A gig is a new structure that we’ve put into Rock Band 4 to sort of capture the feeling of a live performance,” Lead Designer Chris Foster told IGN. It’s also an incredible way to have an extra layer of fun, or cause tension with, the people you’re playing with. Here’s hoping Rock Band 4 doesn’t cause any band breakups. You'll 'as a band' be able to vote on a setlist. Foster explained that the act of performing live music isn’t represented completely accurately in previous Rock Band games. You don’t hop on stage, play a song, and leave. “It’s sort of the ebb and flow of the arc of a performance over successive songs. So, like, the crowd coming with you, or potentially you needing to win them over…it’s a sense of momentum and pacing. So what we wanted to do with this is capture the sense of a gig and use it for narrative means, for new gameplay and emotional experiences within the Rock Band framework.” Essentially, Gigs operate similar to older games’ Setlists, or Rock Band 3’s Challenges. “It’s a series of songs subdivided into a series of sets with set breaks,” said Foster. A Gig we played involved four songs in two sets of two. A set break between each duo had stuff we’ve never seen in Rock Band before. “If you’re the vocalist, you’re able to perform a sort of stage patter…it’s sort of like adding some LARPing to your Rock Band experience,” Foster said. “You’re sort of role-playing a different event that is sort of happening offstage, or got you to the show in the first place inside the campaign, we’re using them to deliver the narrative experience.” So what does that mean, gameplay-wise? “They need to be really fun to play,” Foster said. “Particularly as the crowd is reacting. So, you’ll do your crowd work as a vocalist, the band will play a couple of songs, and then you’ll take another break. And in those breaks, you’ll be able to do a lot of voting. In some cases, there’ll be a set list that is predefined, like in previous Rock Bands. But in other cases, you’ll – as a band – be able to vote on a setlist.” Choices appear between sets, drawn from your music library and the gig’s theme/genre. Bandmates have a limited time to choose the song they all wish to play -- which could lead to interesting, awkward interactions with you band. Your guitarist may decide on a spectacular, fun song the vocalist doesn’t know, or can’t sing to properly. An exhausted drummer can vote for something laid-back, while the rest of his bandmates troll her with a gnarly drum solo track. “It becomes a really interesting collaborative and competitive experience, as you’ll have people say what they want and what they absolutely don’t want,” Foster said. “It’s fun, because when you’re beat-matching, it’s tunnel vision; you’re focused on your instrument, you’re barely aware of other people if they’re falling out or if you can save them. But the moments between songs, we’re able to come up with these other game experiences, and they can be really fun.” Fighting or messing with your band isn’t necessarily to your advantage of course. You can carry over your multipliers and Overdrive power between songs during gigs, adding a small but interesting extra layer of strategy that can affect your band’s score. Gigs can be played for kicks in a party setting, for sure, but they’re also core to Rock Band 4’s campaign -- which involves an interesting branching narrative similar to an RPG. We’ll have more on that for you later this month.

    "DiffbotBody": "Her sister recently just became a single mother-of-three since splitting from longtime boyfriend Scott Disick. And on Thursday, Kim Kardashian continued to rally around her older sibling Kourtney Kardashian by showing some sisterly support on her Instagram page with a throwback photo from 2008. The pregnant 34-year-old reality star has been there for her 36-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians co-star in the last few days following Scott's reportedly wild behavior of partying and flirting with rumoured ex Chloe Bartoli. Scroll down for video Kim shared an old photo of the siblings having fun in a photobooth complete with playful props and a red curtain backdrop. In the snap, Mrs Kanye West is pictured on the right wearing a purple satin dress showing off her toned arm with her hand on her hip. The mother-of-one donned a white glove on her right hand and covered her eyes with her husband's signature music video glasses even noting: '#KanyeStrongerGlasses.' Meanwhile Kourtney wore a strapless scarlet mini dress and was dressed in a costume of blue feather boa, rose coloured sunglasses and fake flowers. Kim's TBT photo comes days after Kourtney and Scott reportedly ended their near decade romance. The parents-of-three have been leading separate lives since their split, with the eldest Kardashian sister even moving her ex's belongings out of their shared Calabasas home. In the midst of his cheating scandal, Scott has postponed a previously scheduled nightclub appearance at his go-to spot 1OAK in Las Vegas. On the same day, it was claimed that the reality star went in and out of rehab in Florida. Us Weekly reported that the troubled star spent just a few hours in the centre, which is believed to be near where he is staying with rumoured ex-girlfriend Chloe. It's unclear if the reality star cancelled his club appearance in a bid to show his ex-girlfriend that he is trying to reform his bad boy ways, or if he wants to avoid being grilled about the split on the red carpet. Scott broke his silence to dedicate a birthday post to daughter Penelope on her birthday: '1 of the only things I'm proud off [sic] about myself. Happybdayp.' Kourtney celebrated the former couple's only daughter's third birthday on July 9 at the Disneyland Resort without Scott, as aunt Kim was in attendance to help commemorate the special day. Since the split, Kourtney has continued to post photos on her social media pages including a selfie from Disneyland writing: 'MVP goes to @kimkardashian for hanging with my crazy Disney obsessed self for 12 hours of major madness. #Disneyland.' On Wednesday, momager Kris Jenner gave an update on her newly single child saying: 'Kourtney's good. Kourtney's hanging in there. We're [all] kind of on lockdown right now. We're filming season 11 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.' Kourtney and Scott have three children together, Mason, five, Penelope, three, and six-month-old Reign.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Three major transport unions have launched a crippling London Underground tube strike yesterday, forcing millions of Londoners dashing for alternate transportation systems to commute to work and get back home. London’s TSSA and RMT transport unions began a 24-hour long strike that overlaps with another organized by Aslef. The TSSA and RMT strike began at 6:30 p.m. yesterday, effectively shutting down all London Underground tube services. According to the Mirror, the unions called for the strike after talks with London Underground’s management over working conditions and wages failed. What seems to have drove the unions into calling for the latest London Underground tube strike is a controversial “night tube” schedule. The “night tube” schedule is a planned weekend overnight Underground schedule that is planned to begin in mid-September on certain sections of select lines. If the plan does go in place as is, some Underground workers may find themselves working alone during overnight shifts for no extra pay. RMT’s official website posted a leaflet explaining why it rejects the London Underground’s demands that they “accept additional night working and working at weekends.” The decision taken by the TSSA and RMT unions followed that of transport union Aslef, which decided to launch an overlapping 24-hour London Underground tube strike that began at 9:30 p.m. yesterday. The Guardian reported that the decision was made after Aslef union members voted for the action by an overwhelming 98 percent. According to the Guardian, TSSA and RMT unions announced their decisions after union members voted in favor of the strike late last month. The TSSA took its decision after its members voted in favor by over 75 percent, while RMT members voted in favor of the action by 91 percent of its votes, according to the Mirror. Official response to the unions’ demands came in different shades of no. The Independent reported London Mayor Boris Johnson gave the most straightforward answer in support of the Night Tube. Johnson was quoted as saying participants of the London Underground tube strike can “strike until they are blue in the face.” Transport for London, the city’s organization responsible for transportation networks, responded to the unions on its Twitter page, saying the “Night Tube will boost” the city’s economy and that “striking is unnecessary.” Night Tube will boost our economy by £360m and will support 2K permanent jobs.

[Image by CGP Grey via Wikimedia Commons] is the latest entry in the last-gen game being remastered for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One party. Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

A comment by tweep Ian Johnson suggests that the train England caught was just finishing its final round before joining the London Underground tube strike. @samengland you caught a ghost tube… A long dead train reliving its final journey… Glad you got off before the end — Ian Johnson (@IJohnson_TNF) July 8, 2015.

    "DiffbotBody": "STAMFORD — By all accounts, the Ridgefield 12-year old Little League team sports one of the most dangerous lineups in the District 1 tournament, needing no help to succeed, but when given a few extra outs to play with they make the opposition pay. Ridgefield twice struck out with two outs in the second inning, but both batters reached base on wild pitches, extending the inning and allowing the bats to get going. And they got going in a big way, busting out for nine runs in the second inning on the way to an 11-6 victory over Weston in the District 1 Little League double-elimination tournament at Springdale Little League Field in Stamford Friday evening. With the win, Ridgefield moves on in the winner’s bracket while Weston falls into the loser’s bracket where it will next play an elimination game Saturday against Wilton. Ridgefield coach Jeff Lacoille said the extra few chances in the second inning were a blessing to his team. “That was huge and we had a nice breakout inning,” Lacoille said. “I kind of made some mistakes out there early and they picked me up.” That breakout inning featured home runs by Johnny Briody and Jake Bongo with eight of the nine Ridgefield batters scoring in the inning and Bongo coming around twice in the frame. For Ridgefield, Bongo scored twice and had 2 RBI; Briody had 2 RBI and a double to go with his home run; Alex Hanna was 2 for 4 with two runs and a RBI and Luke Barrientos drove in two runs on the evening. Weston coach Seve Esposito said at this stage in the tournament it is tough to win when making mistakes. “We can’t do that,” Esposito said. “We are like a dark horse in this tournament because we have never gotten this far but we have done that by making no mistakes. When you start giving up 3, 4, 5 outs an inning that’s how it happens.” For Weston, Myles Lehrman was 4 for 4 with two doubles and two runs scored; Evan Levine had a home run, double and 5 RBI and Alex Olsen hit a home run and scored three runs as Weston chipped away at the lead but could not whittle it down. Weston led 2-0 in the second with Levine plating two runs with a double. Weston added a run in the fourth on Olsen’s home run and three more in the sixth on Levine’s blast. Ridgefield tacked on two more runs in the fifth, padding the lead with runs driven in by Jack Gonzalez and Diego Pepe. Ridgefield 11, Weston 6 Batteries: R - Jack Bohrer, Andrew Forsyth (2, W), Johnny Briody (4), Luke Barrientos (6) and Jason Hartnett. W - Andrew Levine (L), Alex Olsen (2), Dante Esposito (4), Stephen Marshalko (5) and Andrew Amato",

    "DiffbotBody": "A TV show named \"Gunsmoke\" made its debut, and another named \"Make Room for Daddy\" won two Emmys. Elvis Presley and Pat Boone had young hearts all shook up, and for the first time, they could listen to those crooners and others on a new gadget called a pocket transistor radio. A new car cost $1,900, gasoline was 23 cents a gallon and rents averaged $87 a month. It was 1955. On July 17 of that year — a year in which the last occupying troops left Austria and the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series — Disneyland opened its doors. If the first day was any indicator of its future, we might have expected Walt Disney's amusement park to fade into oblivion, much like Georgia Gibbs' No. 1 Billboard hit \"Dance With Me Henry\" did. (Quick, hum a few bars.) The chaos of Disneyland's debut played out in front of a national television audience, and predictions of epic failure abounded. Sixty years later, we know how wrong those naysayers were. With nearly 17 million annual visitors, Disneyland is the biggest draw in California and among the top tourist destinations in the world. The park's drawing power persuaded Disney to build theme parks in Florida, France, Japan and China. Other amusement parks, such as Denmark's Tivoli Gardens, existed, but Disneyland established a modern theme-park template that has been often duplicated but rarely matched. We think we know Disneyland; after all, we've had 60 years to get acquainted. But do we really? Reporters Christopher Reynolds and Brady MacDonald have compiled a list of 60 things you might not know on the diamond anniversary of the theme park that became the gold standard. 1. Much of Disneyland is built to scale to create the illusion of a full-scale experience. The trains circling the park and the Mark Twain Riverboat are built to 5/8 scale. Sleeping Beauty Castle and the storefronts on Main Street, U.S.A., use forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller. 2. More than a million corn dogs are sold annually at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park. L.A. Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold calls the Disneyland corn dog the best he's ever had. 3. The Rivers of America in Frontierland is 4 to 8 feet deep. The first time the man-made river was filled in 1955, the water seeped through the sandy soil. The riverbed was eventually lined with clay to prevent leaking. 4. The Rivers of America held 6.16 million gallons of water the first time it was filled and lost 30,000 gallons a day to evaporation. 5. Maintenance crews dump 12 pounds of green or brown dye into the water a couple of times a week to color the river. 6. The 8- to 15-foot-tall berm that surrounds Disneyland was designed to keep out the real world and keep in the fantasy world. The dirt for the berm came from the excavation of the Rivers of America. Some of the 350,000 cubic yards of excavated dirt was also used to create what would become Tom Sawyer Island. 7. The Disney family crest can be found over the entrance to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The coat of arms was placed above the arch in 1965, about a year before Walt Disney's death. 8. About 84 million Mickey Mouse ears have been sold since 1955. The Mouseketeers first wore the hats in the 1950s on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television show. 9. More than 750 million people have visited Disneyland since opening day. It took just seven weeks for the first million visitors to walk through the gates. Attendance was 3.6 million in 1955-56, its first year of operation. 10. More than 50 scuba divers maintain the water-based attractions and waterways at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. 11. Dream of getting married in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle? You can, but it will set you back $120,000 for an after-hours ceremony. A trip in Cinderella's crystal coach is included, but if you want Mickey and Minnie Mouse to attend, it will cost you an additional $1,425 for a 30-minute visit. 12. Disneyland has a \"jail\" for disruptive guests (Disney-speak for visitors). They're typically held in a security office until Anaheim police arrive. Undercover Disney security officers have been known to watch for shoplifters. 13. No gum is sold at Disney theme parks. Walt Disney didn't want visitors to step in discarded chewing gum. 14. A small lamp remains lighted in the window above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., in memory of Walt Disney. He often stayed overnight in the 500-square-foot apartment during construction of Disneyland. A larger Disney family apartment was later built above New Orleans Square. 15. The apartment above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., includes a dressing area, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a shower. The couches fold out to make additional beds. 16. On opening day, Disneyland contained 800 mostly nonindigenous species of plants from as far away as Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan. 17. More than 12,000 orange trees were removed from the 160-acre plot that became Disneyland. Some of the discarded trees were replanted upside down along the banks of the Jungle Cruise to look like mangrove roots. 18. The route of the Jungle Cruise was laid out with a Jeep outfitted to simulate the length and width of a riverboat. 19. The Mark Twain stern-wheeler, built at a cost of $150,000, was constructed in pieces and assembled at Disneyland. The upper deck was fabricated in Burbank, and the hull was built at a San Pedro shipyard, trucked overnight to the park and lifted by crane into the Rivers of America. 20. Fantasyland's carousel operated at Toronto's Sunnyside Park for decades before being moved to Disneyland in advance of the park's opening. The original carousel featured a menagerie of animals but now has only horses. Additional horses were acquired from other amusement parks. 21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million. 48. In summer 1970, somebody circulated gag fliers proposing a yippie invasion of Disneyland on Aug. 6. On the appointed day, dozens of yippies, or perhaps generic hippies, gathered on Tom Sawyer Island and raised a Viet Cong flag. Management took the rare step of closing the park five hours early, prompting a bold headline (with photos) on the next day's front page of The Times: \"Yippies' Outburst Shuts Disneyland.\" 49. When the park opened, it had both pay and free toilets. Soon after, all bathrooms became free. 50. Walt Disney and author Ray Bradbury were friends. One day at lunch, Bradbury offered to help rebuild Tomorrowland. Disney is said to have replied: \"Ray, it's no use … you're a genius and I'm a genius … after two weeks we'd kill each other!\" Later, Bradbury called it \"the nicest turndown I've ever had.\" 51. By the time It's a Small World opened at Disneyland in 1966, it had already been seen by more than 10 million visitors during its two years at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. 52. Walt Disney had a lot of input into Pirates of the Caribbean, but he died in December 1966, about four months before the ride opened. 53. In 1971, stage psychic the Amazing Criswell predicted that by 1999, Disneyland would be covered by a plastic bubble, its weather controlled by a switch. 54. Though Walt Disney sported a mustache for most of his adult life, Disneyland banned facial hair on its workers from 1957 until 2000, when restrictions were eased. 55. If Disneyland's original $1 adult admission fee had increased in lockstep with the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, today it would be $8.87. Instead, it's $99. (But in the old days, you had to buy ride tickets separately. Now they're included.) 56. In September 1959, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a historic visit to Los Angeles and asked to see Disneyland. His minders first said yes, and then no, after Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker said he couldn't guarantee Khrushchev's safety. \"Why not?\" Khrushchev protested at a public luncheon. \"What is it? Do you have rocket-launching pads there? ... Is there an epidemic of cholera there? … Have gangsters taken hold of the place?\" 57. In Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the Toad Hall library includes these titles: \"For Whom the Toads Croak\" and \"A Tadpole Grows in Brooklyn.\" 58. When it opened in June 1959, Disneyland's monorail was the first daily operating monorail in the Western Hemisphere. 59. Sleeping Beauty Castle is 77 feet tall. Neuschwanstein, the 19th century Bavarian castle that's widely credited as its inspiration, is 213 feet high. (Neuschwanstein, about 80 miles southwest of Munich, Germany, gets 1.4 million visitors yearly.) 60. For height reasons, there's a good chance Mickey Mouse and many other costumed characters are played by female cast members. Male cast members portray the taller characters such as Goofy and Sheriff Woody. Princess characters have strict height requirements: They must be 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall.

    "DiffbotBody": "We know the feeling: After backpacking up the mountain and setting up the tents, we slip into sleep, never mind the lumpy ground. Ancient wiring in our brainstem—the region that connects the upper cerebral structures to the lower spinal cord—switches its activity, dialing down the arousal system that makes us alert and attentive when we are up, and releasing neurochemicals that usher in the soothing loss of conscious awareness. To most of us, sleep resembles coma. But the sleeper will wake to shaking or the sound of an alarm, while the coma patient is completely unresponsive, save for some automatic reflexes, such as a knee-jerk reflex. Unlike sleep, coma is a disorder of consciousness, resulting from severe brain damage caused by head injury, stroke or oxygen deprivation. Many patients eventually exhibit some recovery from coma. But a patient may improve only to remain indefinitely in a vegetative state, still unresponsive even though the eyes are sometimes open—or in a minimally conscious state, occasionally responding to simple verbal commands. Until recently, neurologists could do little more than tell patients’ families to wait and hope. However, technical innovations for helping select patients may change all that. A head injury damages the circuitry of the arousal system. Hemorrhages—that is, bleeding—are a major culprit. The pressure of blood in a closed skull can crush the delicate nerve fibers. Normally, to wake us up, the brainstem boots up the central thalamus. In some patients with minimal consciousness, disrupted wiring means the brainstem’s “wake up” signals cannot reach the central thalamus, and thus it stays quiescent. The patient’s brain is stuck in unconsciousness. Some neurologists, such as Nicholas Schiff at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, have hoped to compensate for the missing signals by directly stimulating the central thalamus. Research with animal models has suggested this could work in humans to restore consciousness. Proof of this concept came with a 36-year-old man who had survived an assault. Eventually he shifted from coma to a minimally conscious state, where he remained unchanged for six years. As part of a feasibility study approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the patient was selected in 2007 for deep brain stimulation. Surgeons implanted a pulse generator into his central thalamus to re-establish normal sleep-wake activity. The current alternated 30 days “on” and 30 “off” for six months. The patient regained voluntary movements of one limb. He also was able to chew, swallow and speak again, conveying cognitive and perceptual responses. Because the overwhelming majority of patients who are in vegetative state for a month or more never progress at all, his recovery of significant capacity was a breakthrough. Moreover, he maintained his gains until his death six years later. But scientists failed at two other human cases of deep brain stimulation. Dr. Schiff and colleagues explain in a 2014 Nature Reviews Neurology paper that if the thalamus itself shows damage, deep brain stimulation can’t be expected to help. Hal Blumenfeld’s lab at Yale School of Medicine, collaborating with Dr. Schiff, studies animal models to calibrate what stimulation protocol best works to shift the brain into responsiveness. Their refinements can be very effective, with stimulated animals getting up and resuming normal exploratory behavior. About 300,000 U.S. patients remain in minimally consciousness states, many more in coma or in vegetative state. Annual costs of care are in the double-digit billions. For some, deep brain stimulation may improve quality of life modestly, if at all. Research will soon clarify which patients stand to benefit. —Mrs. Churchland is a neurophilosopher at the University of California, San Diego. Her most recent book is “Touching a Nerve.”",
    "LabBody": "We know the feeling: After backpacking up the mountain and setting up the tents, we slip into sleep, never mind the lumpy ground. Ancient wiring in our brainstem—the region that connects the upper cerebral structures to the lower spinal cord—switches its activity, dialing down the arousal system that makes us alert and attentive when we are up, and releasing neurochemicals that usher in the soothing loss of conscious awareness. To most of us, sleep resembles coma. But the sleeper will wake to shaking or the sound of an...",

    "DiffbotBody": "Born: April 14, 1931 Died: April 15, 2015 Family: He is survived by his wife, Doris Ann (Bourguignon); and three children, six grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, two brothers and a sister. Personal: Lucy Brubaker, a member of Bethany Children's Home Ladies Auxiliary, said she still attends Faith United Church of Christ, Grantville, Dauphin County, one of two churches where Henning was the pastor before serving at Bethany. A Henning legacy from that pastorate was years of camping trips with six or eight church families to Maine or Myrtle Beach, S.C., she said. The camping trips continue and the participant numbers have grown to 35 or 40 people, spanning generations. Susan Schmehl tells the story of one of the teens at Bethany's Children's Home, Womelsdorf, climbing a tree and refusing to come down. \"No one could get him out of the tree, so they finally went to 'Rev.' (the Rev. Dr. Harold A. Henning, longtime executive director of the home) for a solution,\" said Schmehl, 69, of Wyomissing, who worked as development director at Bethany for many years. Henning, seldom at a loss for a creative solution, had one for the tree-boy. He ordered the boy to get his backside out of the tree right away. \"OK,\" said the kid, complying respectfully. So, what does that anecdote say about Henning? It says he was direct and plain-spoken when conveying his feelings. It also demonstrates he was well-respected. And that was because he was honest, hardworking, creative and perhaps, just like most any other kid at heart, he loved baseball, fishing and camping. And children and adults ultimately loved him for all of that. At his core, Henning believed in lasting relationships and was committed to taking the time to make them. \"He was a wonderful father figure to hundreds of children,'' said his oldest son, Jon Henning of Robesonia, who worked with his father as a social worker for years. \"One employee once said of him, 'He could step on your toes and not scuff your shoes.' \" That's an outstanding human art. Henning of South Heidelberg Township died in April at age 84. He was assistant to the superintendent at Bethany from 1966 until 1985 and executive director from 1985 to 2000. He was named Executive Director of the Year for 1993 by the Council for Health and Welfare Services of the United Church of Christ. \"He was an excellent administrator and loved the kids,\" said his successor, the Rev. Alan Miller, 63, of Schnecksville, Lehigh County, United Church of Christ Penn Northeast Conference minister. \"After he retired from Bethany, he was the interim minister here before I came,\" Miller said. \"He had a wonderful sense of humor and when he laughed his whole body laughed.\" Miller praised Henning's positive vision and people skills that allowed him to get things done. \"I don't know what initially drew him to children,\" said Schmehl, except that when children have needs we tend to respond and advocate for them. Schmehl said when the Conrad Weiser School District closed a day-care program, Henning had a new proposal within three days to move the day care to Bethany. \"He was always finding ways to address needs of children,\" she said. \"He was a wonderful man,\" added Gary Neider, 62, Bethany's retired director of social work, who told of Henning's straightforward compassion. \"When my dad was being treated for cancer three days a week, he (Henning) was very supportive and told me just to do what I had to do and to keep my hours flexible,\" Neider said. \"He was a strong leader, but a very approachable person.\" Hundreds of people came to pay their respects to Henning at his funeral. \"We had to keep putting up chairs because the church could hardly hold everybody,\" Jon said. That's another legacy of love to a man who once told a child in no uncertain terms to get out of a tree, desiring that he embrace life with all its complexity and be well-grounded.

In addition to being charged Wednesday in the three robberies that occurred throughout last week, David O. Border, 22, had an outstanding arrest warrant for burglary in the May 11 break-in of Trooper Thorn's Irish Beef House in Reading. Border and his 16-year-old accomplice were arrested by city detectives Tuesday in the 300 block of North 11th Street, Sgt. John M. Solecki of the criminal investigations section said. Border ran out the back door when officers arrived at a relative's home but officers had the residence surrounded and took him into custody. Border admitted to committing the robberies in the 1100 block of Elm Street after conspiring with the 16-year-old girl he described as like a sister to him, according to court papers. He was committed to Berks County Prison in lieu of combined $80,000 bail after arraignment Tuesday night before Senior District Judge Richard A. Gatti in Reading Central Court. He is charged with three counts of robbery, three counts of making terroristic threats, one count of aggravated assault and related counts, as well as burglary-related charges. According to investigators: Each of the victims had conversed for a period of time with the girl, who put her profile on dating sites such as Meet24 and MeetMe. She arranged to meet the men at specific addresses within the 1100 block of Elm Street. Border waited and Elm and Locust streets and confronted the men when they arrived for the rendezvous. He told them they needed to stop talking with his “sister” because she was less than 18 years old, then demanded money and their cellphone. On July 13 about 12:30 a.m., Border robbed a man of $80 and his cellphone, valued at $120. The victim wasn't injured. On July 15 at 10:30 p.m. Border robbed a man of $116 and his cellphone, valued at $300. The victim wasn't injured. On Sunday about 7 p.m., Border assaulted and robbed a man of his cellphone, valued at $200. He repeatedly punched the victim because he wouldn't give up his phone, then picked up a large rock and threatened to beat him with it until he surrendered the device. The victim in the July 15 robbery gave investigators the profile information of the girl he had arranged to meet and police identified her through her photo. Police recognized the photo because the girl was reported as a runaway by her family, Solecki said. She was charged with robbery and conspiracy as a juvenile and is being detained in Abraxas Academy to await a hearing before Berks County juvenile authorities. In the Trooper Thorn's burglary, Reading police said Border forced open a window screen in the rear of the building to get inside. Surveillance video shows he unsuccessfully tried to take a TV before taking 10 bottles of liquor worth about $200, five cases of beer valued at about $100 and a case of Red Bull energy drink valued at about $36.

All five fights finished with clear-cut results, eliminating the doubt that typically comes with decisions. Two of the bouts ended with a flying-knee knockout.

McGregor is right there with Ronda Rousey as one of the biggest stars in UFC, and Saturday night’s fight against Mendes for the interim welterweight title was an opportunity for him to show the hype surrounding him was deserved. He even got into it with a fellow fighter before the weigh-in. Against the top-ranked contender featherweight in Mendes, McGregor proved he belongs with a TKO in the second round. He trash-talked throughout the fight, and then continued to do so in the press conference after. The big winner here is UFC. Featherweight champion Jose Aldo was supposed to be McGregor’s opponent, but a rib injury forced him off the card and Mendes replaced him. This all sets up for a McGregor-Aldo bout in the future that will decide who truly deserves the featherweight title.",

Comment Hey soccer, I thought we had a deal. Every four years we act like we care about the World Cup, and then you go away until the next time. In its corrupt world soccer conspiracy, FIFA violated our unwritten agreement by getting back in the news. Sepp Blatter was elected to a fifth term as FIFA president; his sixth term might be in prison. He is the (ex-Illinois Governor) Rod Blagojevich of world soccer, and now says he will resign. Blatter, 79, is dealing with a U.S. Justice Department criminal probe and the arrest of 14 FIFA officials for bribery in an international operation long known for corruption. They acted shocked at the allegations. It was the international equivalent of “There is no gambling at Bushwood Country Club.” Our Justice Department has been contemplating charges against FIFA for 24 years. Indictments would have come earlier in the Obama administration had FIFA been Republican. In an instinctive attempt to get themselves out of trouble, FIFA board members immediately awarded the U.S. Justice Department the beer concessions revenue from the 2018 World Cup. The good news is that Americans might now pay attention to soccer if a corruption trial is involved. We do not like a sport where the score always seems to be 0 to 0. I scored more in junior high school ... well, the same. Soccer represents the cultural divide between us and the rest of the world. Most soccer-obsessed countries take the day off for the FIFA-run World Cup, although they will shut down at any time for pretty much anything that might involve heavy drinking and the possibility of a fistfight. Most soccer countries have riot-based economies anyway. If Obama had his way, the U.S. would subjugate itself to corrupt world bodies like the U.N. and FIFA. It is this international culture of corruption and non-accountability which prompted the Clinton Foundation to do most of its fund raising overseas. Predictably, FIFA has been a big donor to the Clinton Foundation, which accounted for its contributions under \"hush money.\" The foundation has both \"slush\" and \"hush\" money accounts. Obama helped to pitch our most corrupt city, Chicago, to FIFA for a World Cup venue. He brought in Bill Clinton to make the case for bringing this soccer event to the USA. Bill had a proven track record of getting things done well under that table and in hallways. But you could tell Clinton’s heart was not in pitching us for soccer - a game where men cannot use their hands. Bill Clinton even shook FIFA down for money. He just can’t resist an international body. We really wouldn’t want the games. Americans have more interest in a Monster Truck show. It’s more entertaining and smells better than an international soccer match. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

Once Germany conquered Argentina in the finals, they instinctively wanted to keep rolling into Austria and Czechoslovakia, and then Poland. Clearly, the Iraqi team had no chance of winning its matches. When play heated up, Iraqi players took off the uniforms America provided for them at great cost, threw them on the ground for the other team to take, and ran. Vladimir Putin scolded the U.S. for bringing charges against FIFA. He was accused of bribing a FIFA official with a Picasso portrait to secure the games for mother Russia. To be fair to Putin, it was not so much a bribe as it was an illustration of what that official's face would look like if Russia didn’t get the 2018 games as promised. You have to hand it to the FIFA soccer officials. They brazenly pocketed an estimated $119 million in bribes and kickbacks. That's hard to do when you're not allowed to use your hands.

    "DiffbotBody": "Olive Oil Olive oil is an alternative to vegetable oils, including canola, peanut and grapeseed oils, in a cake mix. Olive oil contains healthier monounsaturated fats, which aid in reducing your risk of heart disease and high cholesterol when eaten in moderation. In contrast, vegetable oils containing omega-6 fatty polyunsaturated acids could potentially increase the risks of heart disease. The Fine Cooking website suggests that using pure olive oil rather than extra-virgin to produce a milder, tender cake can also save you money. Dairy Substitutes Angie Thayer, a registered dietitian and food and regulatory specialist for Wilton Brands, recommends substituting oil with dairy products. Reduced-fat products will also assist in reducing overall fat and calorie consumption. Replace every cup of oil with 3/4 cup of a dairy substitute such as yogurt or sour cream. Reduced-fat products may produce a drier, denser mix, so try adding 1 to 2 extra tablespoons to negate this effect.",
    "LabBody": "Cake mixes are a convenient alternative to baking from scratch, saving you time and worry, particularly if homemade baking isn't your forte. Most boxed cake mixes call for two to three extra ingredients including water, eggs and oil, most frequently vegetable oil. Oil serves to bind all the ingredients together in addition to adding extra moisture for a moist, tender cake. You can omit vegetable oil and still produce a tasty, rich cake with other oil and nonoil alternatives. Substitute butter for vegetable oil when preparing your cake mix. Use an equal amount of butter as you would vegetable oil, or a 1:1 ratio, adding it cup for cup with your mix. Melt the butter prior to mixing it with other ingredients to avoid clumping and ensure smooth, even distribution and texture. Butter makes for a slightly denser cake due to its richness and is ideal for stacked, layered cakes.

The three-and-a-half minute video gives loyal followers insight on the making of the highly-anticipated seventh film of the franchise. Classic stars including Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew and Anthony Daniels could be seen in the clip as well as newcomers Lupita Nyong'o, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Domhnall Gleeson. Director of the flick, JJ Abrams, is shown hyping up the cast and crew as he makes the announcement: 'We are here on day one of Star Wars: Episode Seven. How incredible is that?' Characters getting into their costumes, interviews with the cast, sets being built, majestic scenes of the desert planet Jakku and even explosions were major elements of the video. Hamill, 63, who starred as Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy filmed in the Seventies and early Eighties reflected in the video: 'Real sets, practical effects, you've been here but you don't know this story. 'Nothing's changed really, well, everything has changed but nothing has changed. That's the way you want it to be really.' He was not the only returning cast member who had similar feelings about being on set as Mayhew, 71, talked about getting back in the groove as he put his Chewbacca costume on. The British actor said: 'Getting back to the old days, the old ways of doing things,' before warming up his signature Chewy growl. The legends were not the only ones hyped up about being on set of the highly-anticipated sci-fi flick as the rookies were seemingly in awe of being there. Newbie Boyega, 23, said: 'You have to pause, take a breath, slow down and really not freak out.' Oscar-winner Nyong'o, 32, could be seen for a moment in the clip with lighted CGI dots all over her head, while Ridley is seen excitedly humming as she was about to fly one of the spacecrafts from the film. Irish actor Gleeson, 32, was excited to be a part of the project with past and present stars alike as he explained: 'I was in the same room as all these legends and with all these new people who I'm sure are going to be legends themselves.' Perhaps nothing displayed the spanning of generations pertaining to the upcoming film than the last shot of the clip which showed Ridley getting into the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon with none other than Han Solo himself: 72-year-old Harrison Ford. On Friday, Director Abrams and several of the stars from the film took part in a panel at Comic-Con to discuss the upcoming film. The film is set for release on December 18.",

    "LabBody": "An 18-year-old man discovered passed out drunk in the Bartlett driveway about sunrise had all the markings for the end of a special night to go with the booze. Some Acqua Di Gio and Polo cologne to smell good. An iPod for tunes and maybe dancing. Some expensive white Oakley sunglasses and even a New Era baseball cap. But when he was hauled to jail on the public intoxication charge, he told jailers that wasn’t his stuff. He acknowledged taking the goods from unlocked cars — by his own estimate 15 to 30 cars, according to police reports. Jonathan Gibson pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of theft on Wednesday, a day after he was found unconscious in a driveway on Evening Light. He is scheduled to return to court later this month to see if he qualifies for diversion. Police still are trying to track down the victims, but appeared a bit stymied by the lack of reports from people who discovered their property missing. Only one victim — a Bartlett police officer who heard about the thefts around the department — claimed any of the property, identifying the Oakleys and the blue New Era cap as taken from a vehicle at his house. Reports state officers responded to a suspicious person call about 5:50 a.m. Tuesday — suspicious because the man was passed out in the driveway. Officers roused Gibson and smelled alcohol. Unsteady on his feet, he was arrested for public intoxication. Police said he was unsure of where he was or how he got there. During questioning, Gibson also couldn’t remember his name and told officers he was born in 1920, meaning he would have to be 95 years old. When Gibson arrived at headquarters and jailers were documenting the belongings, he told them only his belt and cellphone were his property. He said the rest of the stuff was taken from cars he entered. Gibson told authorities he was looking for anything of value to sell. That led to the burglary from an automobile charge, which was reduced to theft in exchange for his guilty plea. With only one victim claiming the property, authorities were unable to determine if Gibson actually rummaged through up to 30 cars, or if the claim was as accurate as his 1920 date of birth.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Mark Stehle Twelve cellblocks come together in a central vestibule where a skylight two stories above provides sunlight. Nestled just above the visitor's entrance to Philadelphia's House of Correction hangs a small wooden sign, painted blue, with \"Welcome\" written on the front, right next to the image of a grinning snowman. \"You'll see how hot it is when we get inside,\" one of the jail's corrections officers says as he ushers me through the lobby — full of whirling fans — and into Warden William Lawton's office for a quick chat. Lawton, a large man, is seated at the end of a long conference table, hunched over some paperwork. To his right, a large flat-screen television hangs from the wall, dormant, right next to a floor-to-ceiling tapestry of the late comedian Bernie Mac, who is shooting a thumbs-up right back at Lawton. This room, at least, has air conditioning. \"My grandson calls this the 'transformer jail!'\" Lawton says. \"He says, 'You're always transforming things to make them work.'\" Lawton, who has worked within the Philadelphia Prison System for 37 years, has been the House of Correction's warden for the last three. \"We've converted space for classrooms, for medical facilities, all of which were not parts of the correctional mindset 200 years ago.\" He tells me he's tired of repairing cracks in the ceiling, tired of sealing leaky pipes, tired of working in a jail built in 1874, then rebuilt using the same bricks in 1927. \"Our keys don't have an automated locking system,\" he says. He mimes unlocking a cell door, twisting one of his hands at the wrist. \"They're made out of brass. We have to special-order parts for them.\" And, on a steamy almost-summer day like today, he's tired of the weather: The jail, built along the same floor plan as the fortress called Eastern State Penitentiary, has no central cooling system. \"Today, it's hot, but unfortunately I can't take my population out to the mall,\" he says, chuckling. \"And the heating system is quite old, but unfortunately, winter still visits us all.\" He swings his hand out and points to a spot on the wall, just behind Bernie Mac. \"This wall is 8 inches thick! It's a real wall,\" he says, implying that it'd be nearly impossible to install new vents or pipes. \"There's no fire-suppression system here. If the place were to catch fire, we'd need to unlock each cell, one by one. It's hard just to provide the humane to people. \"There have been plans to replace this place for 15 years,\" he continues. \"But it just hasn't worked out.\" **** Lawton's concerns echo, almost word-for-word, those of City Councilman Bobby Henon, who has been trying — at Mayor Michael Nutter's request — to replace the House of Correction with a brand-new jail. Henon, a sturdy man with a thick helmet of iron-gray hair, was the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union's political director before winning a seat on Council in 2011. Henon's 6th Council District includes the neighborhoods of Mayfair, Frankford and Holmesburg, home of the House of Correction. In February, Nutter's office released its annual six-year capital program plan, which conspicuously included $4.9 million to purchase land for \"prison expansion potential.\" On April 30 Henon introduced Bill 150406 — which would let the city spend up to $7.2 million to buy a parcel of land at 7777 State Road, adjacent to the House of Correction. He chose, however, to hold the bill after the City Planning Commission voted 5-0 against the plan. (A number of Holmesburg residents also spoke out against the idea.) Both Henon's and Nutter's camps claim now is the right time to get started, mostly because there's land available: The House of Correction, which housed 1,492 lower-security prisoners as of Sunday, is a crumbling, perennial money-suck, Henon argues. Rather than spend millions to renovate it, building a new facility on the State Road property (which, interestingly, is owned by a limited-liability company called 7777 Philadelphia Pa Loan Associates, though Henon says the company is owned by BNP Paribas bank) makes far more sense to Henon, both monetarily and from a human-rights standpoint. The House is falling apart and should not be used to hold prisoners, Henon says. (Nutter also asked for $5 million this year to repair the jail's roof.) Critics have launched a full-scale attack on the plan, contending that building a new jail would likely cost the city between $300 million and $500 million, money City Council can never seem to find when it comes to funding Philly's impoverished School District. Henon has countered that money for a new jail would come from the city's capital budget, which comes from funds borrowed against municipal bonds, rather than its operating budget, where money for the schools is allocated. Though Henon argues that the capital budget is not funded directly by taxpayers, most of his opponents haven't bought his logic. Fellow Councilman Curtis Jones Jr. has been, perhaps, Henon's most vocal opponent on Council: \"Yeah it's two different budgets, but it comes out of your same pocket,\" he told WURD 900 AM radio host Solomon Jones. The city's General Obligation bonds, which would fund a portion of the land purchase, are repaid from the city's general tax revenues. Likewise, a number of prison-reform advocates believe the city should instead streamline its Department of Pretrial Services. There are currently 8,113 inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System's six facilities: Besides the 1,500 at the House of Correction (which theoretically is supposed to hold 1,250), about 2,700 men sit inside the city's largest jail, the Curran-Fromhold Correction Facility, which opened in 1995. Likewise, the 50-year-old Detention Center holds around 1,200; the Philadelphia Industrial Correction Center, opened in 1986, holds roughly 1,000; and the Riverside Correctional Facility, the city's sole female-only jail, holds 750 women. However, around 6,000 of the 8,000 people sitting in the Philadelphia Prison System are currently being held pretrial, many of them because they are unable to post bail. \"Our position on it is that the House of Correction should be closed,\" said civil rights lawyer David Rudovsky, when asked about what ought to happen to the jail. He insisted, however, that a new one should not be built. \"If you build it, you're gonna fill it. That's how prisons work.\" \"The jail population can be safely lowered to a point that new beds would not be needed,\" he added in an e-mail. Henon could have brought the land purchase to a vote during Council's final four legislative sessions in May and June but he held on to the bill after protesters, many of them members of the prison-reform advocacy group Decarcerate PA, flooded some of the meetings. On June 17, he sent it back to the Public Property Committee, saying he'd use the Council recess to speak to more constituents before bringing the bill to vote again in the fall. I sat down with Henon in his office on City Hall's fourth floor on June 29 to parse out what his plans were going forward. \"I agree that we need to cut down on the pretrial process, and the incarceration rates,\" he said. \"Decreasing the population should be addressed. But if you decrease the population from its current number to 6,000, there still will be a need for a House of Correction.\" He went on, stressing, as he has on numerous occasions, that his plan does not \"add\" a prison to the system: \"Once the new one is built, the old one will be shut down.\" He mentioned to me, however, that the proposed new jail would have 2,500 beds, a 1,000-bed increase over the existing House of Correction. Henon says the bed increase won't lead to a population increase. He says the new beds should just allow men throughout the system who are being held in triple cells to move to two-man cells in the new facility. But an increase in beds does not necessarily lead to a decrease in overcrowding. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons increased overall capacity of federal prisons in this country by 8,300 beds from 2006 to 2011, only to see its levels of crowding increase as well, due to an increase in arrests, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. According to a Pew Charitable Trusts report, Philly's jail population peaked at 9,787 inmates in 2009, before falling to around 7,700 in 2011. The population is now about 400 larger, mainly for two reasons. Mayor Nutter in 2012 asked the city to begin issuing higher bails to those accused of gun crimes, effectively punishing inmates before they've been convicted. The second reason has to do with a 2009 Inquirer series about men and women skipping bail in Philadelphia: In response, the city created a Bench Warrant Court in 2012 to crack down on bail fugitives. Earlier this year, the city received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation to look into ways to decrease its jail population. Through everything, one point remains undeniable: Absolutely no one should be sitting inside the House of Correction. **** Back out in the main lobby, visitors enter and exit, and guards shout to be heard over the sound of the fans. The air is thick, soupy and stale-smelling. Capt. Joe Browne, one of the jail's chief corrections officers — tall, with gray hair, a long face and the wide stance of a man prepared to break up a brawl — leads us out of the lobby. We go through a small courtyard wrapped in barbed wire, through a metal detector and come up to a thick metal gate. On the other side is a hallway with doors to the jail's schoolhouse, medical center and visitation room. Inmates, clad in blue, line up along the right side of the central hallway as they wait to enter the visitation room. Most stare at the ground. A guard jams a thick, brass key into the door and swings it open with two hands. The visitation room seems standard, if a bit low-budget: Prisoners sit in plastic chairs, arranged in rows and their visitors sit facing them, about 2 feet away, just far enough to make it difficult to touch. \"They're allowed to hug and kiss each other good-bye,\" Shawn Hawes, a prison spokesperson, tells me. An air-conditioning unit the size of a vending machine drones on, drowning out what is being said. **** The original House of Correction was built — ironic as this may now sound — to alleviate overcrowding. In response to a prison system absolutely swamped with inmates, the city in 1861 convened a Joint Committee on the Erection of a House of Corrections, which issued a report that is still available at the Philadelphia Free Library's Central Branch. James J. Barclay, then the president of the city's Board of Managers, wrote that in 1859, the city's prisons were so overstuffed with victims of \"intemperance\" that more than 7,000 people were discharged for \"want of room\" in that year alone. Sadder still, the system was, even in the 19th century, clogged with inmates being held pretrial: At Moyamensing Prison, which stood at 1400 S. 10th St. from 1835 to 1963, men slept three to five to a cell, and there were \"hardly 50 cells to spare for the number of untried criminals alone.\" So, to hopefully relieve some of the system's congestion, the city got to work on the original House of Correction, which opened in 1874. \"All through the 19th century, there was this really strong belief that isolation was good,\" says Sean Kelley, a prison historian and director of interpretation and public programming at Eastern State Penitentiary. \"The model for the original House of Correction would have undoubtedly been solitary confinement.\" The House's board of directors kept detailed records through the jail's first few years of operation, noting that the facility became overcrowded almost immediately. A year after opening, there were more than 1,500 inmates inside, and board members had already begun petitioning the city to buy more land. \"I cannot too strongly recommend the purchase of additional property,\" one remarked, after noting that there was not enough farmland surrounding the prison to properly feed the inmates. By 1876, the overcrowding had become worrisome: The facility processed 8,074 inmates, and, at any point in the year, typically held more than 2,000. The building was knocked down in 1925 and rebuilt, opening again two years later. \"It's hard to emphasize enough how much it looks like Eastern State,\" Kelley says. \"It looks shockingly similar. It's medieval.\" He says, however, that 100-year-old prisons are common across the country. \"Nineteen twenty-six is, sad to say, not that old of a prison in the scheme of things.\" Kelley adds, \"These things are really built to take abuse. They're built to withstand people who want to intentionally harm them. What they build might be around for the next hundred years.\" **** With the door closed, the prison Learning Lab feels like an elementary school classroom. There's a large teacher's desk in the center of the room, and the walls, painted a light blue, are covered in bright-colored posters espousing the joys of English and arithmetic. Mid-2000s-era PCs line the back wall. These, I'm told, are used to administer G.E.D. training. \"Most of our inmates are testing around the fifth-grade reading level,\" says Hawes, the prison spokesperson. Wayne Jacobs, a former inmate who now heads X-Offenders for Community Empowerment, a group that helps parolees find employment after leaving prison, told me he believes the city ought to be relying more on G.E.D. training programs to keep those awaiting trial out of the permanent prison population. \"The city should begin to look at those 1,500 prisoners to see how many are willing to go to drug treatment, mental-health treatment, G.E.D. job readiness while they're waiting to go to court,\" Jacobs says. \"They can easily send those folks to those particular programs. They should increase their pretrial-services budget, so they can be able to place people on house arrest in those programs. This way, we will be able to empty out the House of Correction.\" Angus Love, executive director of the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, which provides legal services to those in prisons, jails and state hospitals, agrees. He believes the city can reduce its population to far fewer than the 6,000 Henon talked about. \"New York City reduced its population,\" Love says. That city's prison population dropped from 22,000 in 1991 to 13,200 in 2009, largely because the city reduced the number of people it arrested on drug charges, according to a report compiled by the Vera Insitute of Justice, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the nonprofit JFA Institute. By city population alone, Philadelphia ought to have a quarter of New York's jail population, Love said, \"but we over-incarcerate. If we invest in alternatives to incarceration, like mental-health treatment, we can bring the population down to three to four thousand, and they could fit inside Curran-Fromhold.\" A few feet down the hall, through an open door, sits the jail's mental-health screening ward. It is, simply put, a paltry excuse for an intake center. There are three small desks for the social workers that assess prisoners, and only one desk sits behind a small door that can be shut to preserve privacy. Today, because the door is open, I peer in and an inmate waves at me and shouts, \"Hello!\" as if we're neighbors running into one another at the bank. A social worker, who asked not to be named, points to a chair next to her desk. \"If I'm talking with a patient, he sits right here, and everyone can hear him,\" she says. I ask if she'd prefer to work in a new facility. \"Ooh,\" she says, pausing for a moment. \"Actually, no. I believe we need to invest more in schools than in a jail. But I think if we focused more on childhood intervention, we'd keep a lot of people out of this system.\" **** The jail's central vestibule sits at the end of the hallway. Standing inside, one gets the sensation of being down in a large pit; the room is semicircular, the bricks are the color of dirt and gray sunlight streams through a skylight vaulted two stories above the ground. Here, 12 hallways arranged like spokes on a wheel meet, each blocked off with an iron gate. We enter one hallway with cells holding 164 prisoners. There's a ruddy shower room at the beginning of the hall, across from a pay-phone bank that appears to have been cleaned even less often than the showers. Exposed copper pipes snake up and around the walls. As we walk, one of the pipes emits a hiss, and water drips down and collects in a puddle on the floor. The entire floor, for that matter, has a film to it. We pass cell after cell. The doors are neither the sliding-style seen in cartoons, nor the thick, gray kind used in most maximum-security prisons. They are, instead, short, hobbit-hole-looking wire grates that may very well have been hand-assembled. There's a tiny porthole in each. Some men stick their faces through them to stare at us, while others lay on their bunks, some shirtless to combat the heat, some with towels over their faces. Browne opens a cell and orders two men out so we can enter. \"Relax, they're not here to search your stuff,\" he tells them. About the size of a college-dorm room, the space houses three men. The walls are stark white, and a copy of the Daily News sits on the bed to the left. To the right, there are two bunk beds, each no bigger than the average human body. Wawa milk cartons sit on the windowsill. Above the sink, in one of the corners, the ceiling has cracked and is beginning to cave in. Wire mesh covers the window, and it's impossible to see anything outside, only whether it's day or night. The air feels heavy and damp, and it's difficult to breathe. On the way out, Browne stops to chat with a group of inmates waiting to head to visitation. Most keep their eyes fixed on the ground. \"Do you guys have any opinions about the House of Correction?\" he asks them. No answer. \"C'mon, guys! I'm serious.\" \"It sucks,\" one inmate says. \"How's the food?\" Browne asks. \"Shitty,\" an older inmate leaning against a gate says, without looking up. \"See?\" Browne asks, turning to me. \"No coercion at all.\"",

Scalia is a famous jurist, admired by many for his intellect and convictions and despised by liberals for his steadfast willingness to act on them. Comment A board I serve on in Washington, D.C. was fortunate to meet with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia last week. Scalia is a famous jurist, admired by many for his intellect and convictions and despised by liberals for his steadfast willingness to act on them. Antonin Scalia, the justice most hated by the left, was unanimously confirmed (98-0) by the Senate in 1986. Imagine how he would fare today with the politics of personal destruction running rampant. With the same-sex marriage decision by the Supreme Court due soon, it was interesting to talk with someone tasked with making an important decision for gays (historically the role of the Tony Awards committee). The Court will determine if defining same-sex marriage is a state’s right or whether marriage remains traditionally defined only as the union of two resentful and entrapped people who eventually end up wearing sweatpants to watch Wheel of Fortune every night. From an Italian immigrant family, Antonin Scalia graduated from Georgetown University and Harvard Law School. He is the embodiment of the American dream, and he seems intent on keeping that dream alive for others. The man we met last week was nothing like the cantankerous lout the media portray him to be. He is a kind, thoughtful man with a good sense of humor: a down-to-earth man whom you would feel very comfortable making major decisions on your behalf. He said humbly that the Supreme Court was less important in citizens’ lives than state and local courts, where 90% of jurisprudence is administered. Most important legal matters that affect us are decided locally. If one commits murder, in the 50 states there can be 50 different burdens of proof and punishments. Rape, robbery, divorce, child custody, etc. are all local court decisions. The Supremes are just there to referee in case the Constitution is violated. I asked him how precedented it was to have a sitting president like our own Obama always chiming in on cases before the Court, in hopes of intimidating the justices to decide in his favor. Justice Scalia said he does not attend the “State of the Union” address for that very reason; if he did, he would have gotten up and left when Obama lectured Justice Alito on the Citizens United decision. He ended with, “What can he do to me anyway?” Justice Scalia has a lifetime appointment; he can’t be removed. The only other appointed lifetime political job in Washington is being the wife of Bill Clinton. Oh wait — sadly, it is no longer true that federal judges are the only lifetime employees. Under Obama, all federal jobs in Washington are perpetual unless the employee commits murder or crosses the president politically. When Justice John Paul Stevens left the Supreme Court at age 89 (he was so old they had to keep reminding him to close his robe), we no longer had a Protestant on the Supreme Court. Now things are going our way for us WASPs. Soon, as a minority, we will be getting into Harvard with 950 SAT scores and qualifying for casino licenses. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

Now things are going our way for us WASPs. Soon, as a minority, we will be getting into Harvard with 950 SAT scores and qualifying for casino licenses. Not all the Court does is boring. Anna Nicole Smith appeared before the Justices. One might think she’d be uncomfortable in the Supreme Court, but in her day Anna Nicole spent a lot of time around old men in robes. Justice Scalia also feels that students should read “The Federalist Papers” and Alexis de Tocqueville (“Democracy in America”). Public school unions would not like students reading about limited government and personal responsibility. Kids today probably think de Tocqueville is a town in Colorado known for its killer weed. Scalia surprised most when he said one of his best friends on the court is liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She’s fun and usually wins the case of Ginsburg v. Jack Daniels. At 83, Justice Ginsburg will not step down unless the NY Yankees sign her. Justice Antonin Scalia will turn 80 soon. I predict that, in a closely followed Supreme Court decision, the justices will vote 5 to 4 to get him a cake.

Policemen and onlookers stand at the base of the crumbled facade of the Italian consulate in Cairo. Photo: AP One of the toughest security crackdowns in Egypt's history has weakened the mainstream Muslim Brotherhood group, blamed by security officials for small-scale bombings. The Brotherhood says it is a peaceful movement. Meanwhile Islamic State's Egyptian affiliate, based in the Sinai, poses a major security threat. It has killed hundreds of soldiers and police since the army deposed President Mohamed Morsi of the Brotherhood in 2013 after mass protests. Egypt has witnessed a recent increase in attacks against tourism targets, including a suicide bombing near the ancient Karnak temple in Luxor last month. An attack on Westerners could signal a dangerous escalation of violence in the country, which is relatively stable in a region engulfed by militancy and sectarian conflict since the Arab Spring uprisings. A Western diplomat said he was aware of the explosion in front of the consulate but could not confirm that the building was the target. The violence and political turmoil triggered by the 2011 revolt that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak have hurt Egypt's tourism industry and economy. Two weeks ago, a car bomb killed the country's top public prosecutor and militants affiliated to Islamic State attacked several military checkpoints in North Sinai, in what was the fiercest fighting in the region in years. The army said 17 soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed in those clashes. Western countries are hoping Sisi can maintain relative stability in the Arab world's most populous country. But military operations in the Sinai – the epicentre of an insurgency led by Islamic State's Egyptian affiliate, called Sinai Province – have failed to defeat militants there. Egypt is also worried about spillover from militants who have been thriving in the chaos of neighbouring Libya, where Sisi has already ordered air strikes on Islamic State targets. Reuters Texas officials have denied the video that showed confrontation between officer and Sandra Bland was edited before release, alleging technical problems. According to the second version of the police video, a Texas police officer threatened Sandra Bland with a Taser when he ordered her out of her vehicle during a traffic stop on July 10, three days before she was found dead in a county jail. A heated confrontation between trooper Brian Encinia leads to the arrest of Sandra Bland after a minor traffic infraction. Photo: Handout/AP Bland - a 28-year old African American woman - was stopped for failing to signal while changing lanes, but the routine traffic stop turned confrontational after the officer, Brian Encinia, ordered Bland to put out her cigarette. \"Would you mind putting out your cigarette, please?\" Encinia said. \"I'm in my car, why do I have to put out my cigarette?\" Bland answered.

Encinia opened the driver's door and attempted to physically remove Bland from the vehicle. A memorial sits outside the Waller County Jail in Hempstead, Texas, where Sandra Bland died in a cell.

A guard motions to a medic arriving with a stretcher to Waller County Jail on July 13. Photo: Handout/Reuters At a press conference on Tuesday, state Senator Royce West said that after viewing the video, he could confirm that Bland was threatened with a Taser by the officer. Details of the confrontation were not included in the arrest warrant written by Encinia, which officials also released on Tuesday, 11 days after the arrest - and eight days after Bland's death in the Waller County Jail. Her death was classified as suicide by hanging, but news of the suicide - which came amid growing outrage over police interactions with African Americans - has been met with skepticism by those who knew Bland, and even others who didn't. Protesters pray at rally outside the Waller County Courthouse after a march on Friday. Photo: Houston Chronicle/AP The arrest warrant detailed Encinia's version of events. The warrant does not mention the Taser, nor does it elaborate on why Encinia ordered Bland out of the vehicle. During the incident, Bland repeatedly asks why she is being arrested. The remainder of the confrontation occurs outside of the view of the camera, but the audio captured what appeared to be a struggle. Bland is heard saying that the officer \"just slammed my head to the ground.\" Protesters rally outside the Waller County Courthouse on Friday. Photo: Houston Chronicle/AP Later, when a female officer arrives at the scene, Encinia tells her that Bland \"started yanking away, then kicked me, so I took her straight to the ground.\" NBC News reported that Texas Department of Public Safety authorities \"said late Tuesday they were looking into alleged edits\" to the 52-minute dashcam video: \"At several points in the video of Bland's arrest, posted Tuesday to the department's YouTube channel, video of a person walking or a car driving by are cut or repeat themselves as the audio continues uninterrupted. \"DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told NBC News that he could not speculate on whether the video was edited. 'I will have to check in the morning. I can't speculate without looking at the CD,' he said, referring to the original recording of the video.\" NBC added that \"the apparent edits to the video, first reported by documentarian and writer Ben Norton, raised the suspicions of people following Bland's story, suspicions authorities sought to allay with the video's release.\" But releasing the new version of the video, Texas officials on Wednesday said the earlier version had technical issues but had not been edited. \"Yesterday's video was not edited,\" Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a statement, adding that the technical issues from the Tuesday release had been resolved in the new version. Vinger said the department has asked the FBI to examine the dashcam video and jail video to ensure their integrity. The entire video was uploaded on Tuesday to include the audio and video of the conversation the trooper had by telephone with his sergeant after the arrest, Vinger said. Investigation The investigation into Bland's jail-cell death is being treated \"just as it would be in a murder investigation,\" Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said at a news conference on Monday evening. Mathias clarified on Tuesday that it is standard practice for any suspicious death in police custody is investigated this way. \"There are many questions being raised in Waller County, across the country and the world about this case. It needs a thorough review,\" Mathis said, noting that the case \"will go to a grand jury,\" the Associated Press reported. The Texas State Rangers have launched an investigation into Bland's death, with the supervision of the FBI. In his arrest warrant, Encinia wrote that Bland was pulled over for failing to signal a lane change and he \"had Bland exit the vehicle to further conduct a safe traffic investigation.\" According to Encinia, \"Bland became combative and uncooperative.\" \"Numerous commands were given to Bland ordering her to exit the vehicle,\" Encinia wrote. \"Bland was removed from the car but became more combative.\" He added that Bland was handcuffed \"for officer safety\" but she \"began swinging her elbows at me and then kicked my right leg in the shin.\" Encinia said he suffered from pain in his right leg and had small cuts on his right hand. \"Force was used to subdue Bland to the ground to which Bland continued to fight back,\" he added. Bland was charged with assault on a public servant then booked in the Waller County Jail, where she later died. \"There are questions that need to be answered as it relates to the arrest,\" noted West, who added that what transpired in the arrest would be part of the ongoing investigation. Asked whether Bland deserved any blame for the events that led to her arrest and death, West replied: \"No.\" Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick cautioned that everyone should wait for the facts of the case to unfold before making a determination about blame. \"There's a rush to judgment too often in America,\" Patrick said on Tuesday. \"But here in Texas, I can tell you that we believe in total transparency and we will find the truth wherever that leads.\" \"If indeed she took her own life, that is a question that has to be asked,\" he added. Encinia, who has been a state trooper for about a year, was placed on administrative duty on Friday pending the outcome of the investigation, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which said that the officer violated the agency's procedures during the traffic stop. \"Regardless of the situation, the DPS state trooper has an obligation to exhibit professionalism and be courteous,\" said DPS Director Steve McCraw. \"That did not happen in this situation.\" Bland's immediate family members and their attorney met privately with Mathis and Waller County Judge Trey Duhon on Tuesday morning for what Duhon called a \"very positive meeting\" that lasted an hour. \"The family expressed some their concerns and the fact that they still have many questions that need to be answered,\" Duhon said. \"It was important to express to the family that my current administration and officials in Waller County are completely committed to an open and transparent investigative process.\" Autopsy An autopsy from the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences has classified Bland's death as suicide by hanging, and the Waller County Sheriff's Office, which administers the jail in which Bland died, said her death appeared to be from \"self-inflicted asphyxiation.\" That determination was fiercely questioned by Bland's family and friends, who said it was \"unfathomable\" that the woman they knew would take her own life. Bland's family has called for an independent autopsy. \"It is very much too early to make any kind of determination that this was a suicide or a murder because the investigations are not complete,\" Mathis told reporters. Mathis noted that \"there are too many questions that need to be resolved. Ms Bland's family does make valid points. She did have a lot of things going on in her life for good.\" Bland was moving from the Chicago suburbs to Texas for a job at her alma mater, Prairie View A\u0026M University, when she was pulled over near the campus on July 10. She \"became argumentative and uncooperative\" during the arrest, the Texas Department of Public Safety said last week, and was taken into custody by a state trooper on a charge of assault on a public servant. After a weekend in the Waller County Jail, Bland was found dead on the morning of July 13. During Monday's press conference, Mathis said investigators would look for DNA and fingerprint traces on the plastic bag that was used in her death. The Waller County Sheriff's Office has now released video footage of the jail in which Bland died. The video does not show what happened in Bland's cell, but it does capture who entered and exited that cell in the hours before and after her death, authorities said. The video of the hours before Bland's death, reviewed by CBS affiliate KHOU, shows an officer stop at her cell at just after 7 am on July 13. The officer \"visually noted she was in good health,\" Captain Brian Cantrell, a spokesman for the Waller County Sheriff's Office, told reporters. \"Ms Bland contacted the main control room, via intercom, at 7:55 am,\" Cantrell said. \"Ms Bland was inquiring on how to make a phone call.\" Just before 9 am, the video shows a female officer approach the cell, peer in, and then ask another officer for help. \"The jailer looked through the window and observed Ms Bland hanging from her privacy partition in her cell,\" Cantrell said. \"I'd also like to reiterate that she was found in a semi-standing position with ligatures surrounding her neck. Ms Bland was then placed on the floor for jailers to perform CPR.\" Cantrell described Bland's death as \"a tragic incident, not one of criminal intent or a criminal act.\" Washington Post, Reuters",

    "DiffbotBody": "What Does Blowing Glass Smell Like? Diffusion Stations As Art in New Exhibition The multi-sensory, rainbow-infused exhibit at Heller Gallery is Katharine Gray’s first solo show in the Chelsea space. The art of glass blowing is alive and well in a most curious, colorful and scented sort of way—and in New York. This Makes Me Think of That is a multi-sensory, rainbow-infused exhibit at Heller Gallery, Katharine Gray’s first solo show in the Chelsea space. The artist said she designed the exhibition “to create some kind of simulated experience for those who will never enter a ‘hot shop’ or step foot on a glassblowing pad.” First, there’s perfume. The Los Angeles based glass artist, in a stroke of pure poetic genius, has collaborated with Opus Oils perfumer Kedra Hart to create four scents that capture the fragrances wafting about a glass studio. Visitors are invited to place their faces over four tall elegant funnel-like flacons, which are essentially diffusing stations, and take a whiff. “As soon as you walk in the hot shop {glass studio}, you get a blast of heat scented with beeswax,” said perfumer Ms. Hart who hung out in a hot box for a few hours for inspiration. She made “Wax,” the most conventionally pleasant scent, with honeyed, smoky materials including beeswax absolute and the very pricey choya nakh, distilled from crushed dry roasted seashells which gave a smoldering sensation. “Paper,” another scent, mimics the odor of the damp newspaper that’s used wet and folded as a shaping tool. “You can’t ever touch the hot glass with your hands directly, it’s too hot,” she said. “I loved that you could faintly smell the ink,” said Ms. Hart who based the wet newspaper scent around oak moss, with a little bit of oud, which she said has the beautiful decay of dampness. A new form of kava kava added the kick of the ink. A third perfume, “Block” replicates the charred cherry wood shaping tool the glass artist dips in water to put a cooling “skin” on glass while working. Seaweed absolute is one of the surprising ingredients, along with vetivert, patchouli and carrot seed. Finally, there is the musty, funky scent of the warm glove used to protect the glass blower from the intense heat when they are actually heating the glass in the furnace or glory hole. It is called “Sleeve,” named after the protective Kevlar sleeve worn by glassblowers, and as expected, had a peculiar olfactory charm lost on most visitors who sniffed it at the gallery. “It was basically a sweaty glove,” said Ms. Hart, who said she went through all the sweat molecules in her database seeking ingredients. “I have smelled fresh sweat that smells good but this glove had been used for a long time. It was the most challenging of all.” Was Ms. Gray at all concerned with putting people off? “No, not really,” she mused. “I found that when I would visit Kedra to smell what she was working on, even with the most off-putting smells, I would want to keep smelling. There was something still vaguely attractive in each one.” For A Rainbow Like You, the title of the visual stunner of the show, Ms. Gray used bright theatrical spotlights to heighten and project the colorful effects of the glasses she made, elevating the prosaic to the celestial. Ms. Gray said she was inspired by stained-glass windows but she was going for a more utilitarian sort of rapture. Ms. Gray had never seen any famed Murano glass from Venice when she blew her “first glass blob” in art school in Toronto when she was 19, but watching that glass magically transform through heat and breath was all it took for her to be hooked on glassblowing— heat, sweat and all. In the show she also shares the auditory experience—put your ear up to a hand-blown drinking glass and hear a recording of glass blowing. But despite the table of glorious, colorful hand-blown glassware dazzling in the reflective light it’s the quirky perfumes that secretly steal the show. If you’re bored with your Chanel No 5, Flower Bomb or L’Eau d’Issey, you can always take the olfactory experience of the hot box home with you, and though it’s a lot pricier than anything you’ll find at Sephora, it’s much more unique. Price, by the way, was no object in creating these perfumes. The gallery is selling limited-edition sets of the artistic scents—tiny vials in a gold leaf box —for $900 but Ms. Gray said they are more to “consult,” to remember the hot shop experience than to wear. Ms. Hart, however, does create seductive, heady, whimsical scents with enchanting names such as Pan, Absinthia and Babylon Noir. The show runs through July 31st. Katherine Gray",

Alongside Julie Christie, his portrayal of the dashing hero became the 1960s’ most prolific movie-screen lover proto-type. In fact, it is hard to think of a rival since, who has equally and adequately portrayed a role filled with so much romance, drama and tenderness. Mr. Sharif played other heroes, too. As the charismatic and inspirational leader Sherif Ali, he played the foil to Peter O’Toole’s Lawrence of Arabia. Mr. Sharif’s Fidel Castro slipped under the radar great performances radar but marked a moment in time. It is as a romantic lead that Mr. Sharif will be so heartbrokenly remembered though. In Europe, this was tempered by a great sense of humor. During the 1970s the actor frequently played the fall guy to classic British comedians Morecambe and Wise on their weekly TV show. He was a private man with a big heart and a huge movie presence. We salute him here.",

    "DiffbotBody": "When you turned on the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, did you know that it was the first time that two brothers started in the game. As in ever, in NBA history? Not only that, but they were going against each other — all respect to the Lopez siblings, but the Gasols have made the case to be the best pair of basketball brothers going today. But, they aren’t the only siblings to ever bask in the spotlight of professional sports. They just happen to be a very talented pair. And history has shown that this is not an uncommon thing. So, with that, let’s take a look at our top seven sets of siblings in sports history. 7. Bob and Mike Bryan Bob and Mike Bryan — The Bryan Brothers — are the most successful pairing in the history of tennis. They are also arguably the best doubles team of all time. Combined they have 103 doubles titles, 16 Grand Slam wins, one Davis Cup title, one Olympic Gold Medal, and are the first pair to ever win all nine ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments. 6. Maurice and Henri Richard Maurice “Rocket” Richard and his brother Henri “The Pocket-Rocket” are both Montreal Canadian legends who won a lot of championships — 19 Stanley Cups between them. Maurice finished his career with 544 goals, 965 points, and one Hart Trophy. While his kid brother Henri tallied 358 goals, 688 assists, and hold the record for most individual Stanley Cups with 11. Both Richard brothers were also induced into the NHL Hall of Fame. 5. Jim and John Harbaugh Before Jim Harbaugh decided to take over the Michigan Wolverines program, he and his older brother, John, became the first siblings to ever square off against each other as head coaches in the NFL. Jim was the leader of the San Francisco 49ers and John roamed the sidelines for the Baltimore Ravens. However, this first meeting was nothing compared to the time these two duking it out in Super Bowl XLVII. In the end, the “HarBowl” would go to John and his Ravens. Jim decamped for the University of Michigan not soon after. Coincidence? Almost entirely. 4. Reggie and Cheryl Miller The Miller siblings were extremely competitive growing up, and that nature paid off for both of their basketball careers. Reggie Miller is considered one of the best shooters in the history of the NBA, and his 2,560 three-pointers is good enough for second on the all-time list. Cheryl Miller is no slouch herself. She only ended up being one of the best female players the sport has ever seen. As a result, it’s no surprise that both of them were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. 3. Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko Vitali Klitschko and his younger brother, Wladimir, were both monsters inside the ring. Wladimir Klitschko is still throwing it down, and currently holds the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles. And while Vitali is now retired, during his time as a heavyweight, he was a WBC and WBO champion, and left the sport with a 45-2 record. These brothers never squared off against each other. And swore they never would. 2. Peyton and Eli Manning The Manning family is football royalty, and Peyton and Eli definitely stand above the rest. But if we’re looking at the two siblings, it’s clear that Peyton Manning is the standard. He has 69,691 career passing yards, 530 touchdown passes, and a record five MVP trophies. In the end though, it may be Eli who gets the last laugh. At this moment in time, he leads his brother in Super Bowls by a count of two to one. And let’s be honest, it’s all about winning, right? 1. Venus and Serena Williams Venus and Serena Williams are the most decorated siblings in professional sports. Serena alone has 19 Grand Slam titles, while sister Venus has accumulated seven individual titles. And these two are a force as a doubles pairing. Together they have taken home 13 Grand Slam titles and three Olympics Gold Medals. It’s safe to say they’ve made their parents very proud.

    "DiffbotBody": "You know the big problem with gigantic lunar craters, right? They’re absolutely freezing! This not only makes them an inhospitable habitat for humans, but even robots designed specifically for a space environment can experience operational and maintenance problems if exposed to the shadowy cold of the Moon for too long. But what if you could reflect sunlight directly into the heart of a lunar crater to generate a warm, well-lit environment that’s better suited to the needs of robots and their kindly human overlords? That’s the thinking behind NASA’s audacious ‘Trans-Formers for Lunar Extreme Environments’ project - one of several new research projects the US space agency greenlit this week. The project involves navigating a rover unit to the rim of a crater, where it will erect a ‘TransFormer’ mirror array to reflect sunlight into the darkened cavity below, with the goal of generating enough warmth and light in the area for experiments to be performed remotely by other robots down at the base. According to Adrian Stoica of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “The TransFormer (TF) concept is a paradigm shift to operating in Extreme Environments (EE). TFs are systems that direct energy into energy-depleted (extreme) environments, transforming them, locally, around robots or humans, into mild micro-environments.” The effect could be amplified by several TransFormer units working in unison, catching different angles of sunlight to provide “continuous collective illumination”, he said. The TransFormer plan is one of seven projects in NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. The goal of the initiative, which awards as much as US$500,000 in funding over the course of a two-year research grant, is to nurture “visionary ideas that could transform future NASA missions with the creation of breakthroughs - radically better or entirely new aerospace concepts - while engaging America’s innovators and entrepreneurs as partners in the journey”. In other words, it’s NASA’s version of the Google ‘Moonshot’ philosophy. Except literally, in some cases, and performed by the very people who invented Moonshots in the first place. The other concepts that have made it through to Phase II of the NIAC program are no less adventurous. They include the Titan Submarine, designed to explore icy oceans on cold planets; Swarm Flyby Gravimetry, which pilots a fleet of small drones around asteroids and comets in order to map their gravitational fields; and the Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (HERTS), a solar sail designed for speedy return trips to outer planets in our Solar System within one to two years of launch. “This is an excellent group of NIAC studies,” said NASA’s Jason Derleth in a statement. “From seeing into cave formations on the Moon to a radically new kind of solar sail that uses solar wind instead of light, NIAC continues to push the bounds of current technology.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "In June of 1865, Confederate Gen. Joseph Shelby and about a thousand of his cavalrymen rode into Mexico and exile rather than remain in a conquered South. As they forded the Rio Grande, they stopped and sank their faded banners midstream in an act of symbolic defiance. Decades later, in the era of Jim Crow and racist attempts to deny black citizens their civil rights, that emblem rose anew, and it has refused to be submerged—until now. Today, the Confederate battle flag may be going down again, perhaps for good, but it is worth considering what we allow to sink with it. On Friday morning at 10 a.m., a vestige of a sad epoch faded when that flag was finally taken down from a flagpole in front of the South Carolina State House. The banner was not destroyed but taken to a museum, to rest alongside other vestiges of the state’s dramatic past. Meanwhile, some country-music stars are backing away from the flag, and House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said Thursday that he personally didn’t believe Confederate flags should be on display in federal cemeteries and parks. The debate continues in Mississippi, the only remaining Southern state whose flag incorporates the design of this Confederate banner. It too may be destined for a museum. This is an old debate electrified by the June 17 massacre of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., a mass shooting that authorities call a racially motivated hate crime. In fact, what is popularly known as “the Confederate flag” never flew over Confederate capitols or public buildings, where different banners reigned. Rather, this emblem brought down on Friday was the Confederate “battle flag,” designed to be carried at the head of a regiment and used as its rallying point in battle, where the flag’s blue St. Andrew’s cross on a field of brilliant red might stand out through the smoke of battle. As such, it primarily stood for a unit’s pride in its valor in action, though all of the Confederacy’s symbols naturally carried an intrinsic affirmation of its foundational tenets, including the perpetuation of slavery. After the Union victory in 1865, those battle flags not surrendered, buried, thrown into rivers or cut up as souvenirs went home to quiet repose in closets, attics and, later, museums. There they remained for decades, undisturbed and in the main undisturbing despite the unhappy meaning still attached to them, their image even protected by veterans’ groups from inappropriate political or commercial use. But that all ended in the 1940s, when opponents of the emerging civil-rights movement raised the old banner for a new battle. Soon, former Confederate states incorporated it into their state flags, and militant white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan began deploying it as a symbol of resistance to integration and voting rights. The worst proponents of white supremacy displayed that emblem while committing unspeakable violence against African-Americans and white supporters of civil rights. They still do: Witness Charleston. Symbols matter. They say at a glimpse what words cannot, encapsulating beliefs and aspirations, prejudices and fears. Having no intrinsic value, they take meaning from the way we use them, changing over time along with our actions. The most obvious example is the ancient “gammadion,” which in early Eastern cultures meant “god,” “good luck,” “eternity” and other benign conjurations. We know it today as the swastika, and a quarter-century of usage by the Nazis forever poisoned it in Western culture. Southern “heritage” groups who oppose removing the battle flag are reluctant to acknowledge that this same dynamic has tainted their cherished emblem. But it has. Whatever the flag meant from 1865 to 1940, the flag’s misuse by a white minority of outspokenly bigoted and often violent people has indelibly shifted that meaning. It is now remembered around the world with images of defiant governors standing in schoolhouse doors, with the snapping dogs of Birmingham, with police barricades to keep black youths out of classrooms, with beatings and lynchings in the night, with churches set ablaze, with fear, intimidation, hatred and the constant reminder that the descendants of slaves were not welcome in their own country. The argument that the battle flag is displayed only as a symbol of pride in Southern heritage loses force when one recalls that while Florida, Alabama and Mississippi added elements of the banner to their flags around the turn of the last century, Georgia incorporated the battle emblem into its state flag only in 1956, and South Carolina began flying the battle flag over its state house as late as 1961. Both were unequivocal declarations of defiance to desegregation and the civil-rights movement. Defenders of the battle flag often further assert that Southern secession and the resultant Civil War had little or nothing to do with slavery, arguing that only a tiny fraction of people in the seceding states—usually cited as 3% to 6%—actually owned slaves. Thus, they say, the flag’s opponents are wrong to condemn it is a symbol of slavery and oppression. But somebody owned the 3.5 million slaves in the Confederate states in 1861. In fact, census records reveal that 31% of all Confederate households held one or more slaves. The same records show that on farms large enough to avail themselves of slave labor, as many as 70% of planters owned their workers. Such ownership defined wealth and social status, regional culture and economic survival. The prospect of abolishing slavery threatened to upend the slave states’ societies and economies. Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 at the head of a Republican Party committed to halting slavery’s spread. If slavery was contained, its death was inevitable. My fellow white Southerners today need feel no shame in confronting the motivations of our ancestors. The Confederates were men and women of their era; we can only judge them legitimately in that context. Otherwise, we could reject virtually all of human history on one currently unacceptable ground or another. As with symbols, standards, norms and mores change over the ages. We could be shocked indeed were we to live long enough to see how Americans 150 years from now might judge us by the measures of their time. Moreover, defending the battle flag with appeals to pride in ancestry and heritage evades the issue, deliberately and unsubtly. Black and white Americans today do not reject this emblem primarily because of what happened in the 1860s. They object because of what the flag has come to symbolize in the U.S. and around the world in our own lifetimes. Many Southerners take legitimate pride in the heroism and sacrifice their ancestors displayed under that banner, but to millions of Americans today, black and white, it means not heritage but hate. To their credit, in times past, some Confederate heritage groups sought to protect the flag from just this sort of metamorphosis, but that battle has been lost every bit as much as the Confederates’ war. When we remember that common tax revenues support every expense connected with flying that flag or with displaying Confederate emblems on federal, state or municipal property, we confront the cruel irony of African-American taxpayers being forced to subsidize constant reminders of past and present injustices. Whatever private individuals and groups choose to do on their persons and their private property—and as Americans, they must be allowed their freedom of expression—the battle flag should disappear from display on public property and retire to museums where it can resume its place as an honored relic. That inevitably raises a question. Our landscape is peppered with monuments, parks, counties, towns, streets and private businesses named for Confederate leaders—not to mention the myriad road signs and markers commemorating the Confederate story. Are all of these to be purged? Where do we stop? Should we take it for granted that the highway that runs near the Pentagon is named for Confederate President Jefferson Davis? Or consider Statuary Hall in the Capitol in Washington, D.C., which allows every state to honor two native luminaries with statues in this national pantheon. Nine Confederate generals and statesmen stand there, including President Davis of Mississippi, Vice President Alexander Stephens of Georgia and the greatest Southern icon of all, Virginia’s Gen. Robert E. Lee. How can we leave them on their pedestals when all bear the taint of being slave-owners or defenders of slavery, not to mention their subsequent varying degrees of opposition to full civil rights for freedmen? Lee presents an especially interesting case. He towers over all other Confederate leaders in myth and memory, and there are more statues and monuments to him today than to any other figure of the Civil War era except Lincoln. Lee understood symbols. After the war, he opposed efforts to place monuments on the Confederacy’s battlefields. In 1869, he counseled that Southerners ought to “obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered.” If he were alive now and remained true to that conviction—as he always did—Lee would probably stand with those calling for taking the battle flag out of its tarnished place in the public forum and returning it to the museum. All of which demands that we ask: Can we ever separate the memory of the Confederate experience from the memory of slavery? Is there any positive legacy to be drawn from the Confederacy? Can we admire Confederate leaders, even the all-but-deified Lee, without tacitly endorsing their cause? Ultimately, can we make the Confederacy worth remembering for the descendants of the slaves and those following generations of freedmen whom the whole nation betrayed by ignoring their new rights and liberties for a century? Perhaps we can—but not through the current Southern fallacy that hundreds of thousands of free and enslaved blacks fought for the South. Such an exercise can come only by directly and honestly addressing the Confederacy and the war it fought, and owning up to the ways they are remembered—both of which are vital to understanding America’s course since 1860. To that end, the Confederacy’s monuments and symbols can be vital learning tools if placed in context. They must be preserved, not expunged. They must be understood, not whitewashed. African-Americans today are understandably outraged by calls to keep the battle flag flying. The “Southern heritage” that most of them recall stands only for repression and humiliation. Still, there are lessons in the Confederate experience, hard to see though they may be. The shibboleth that “state rights” caused secession is a suit of clothes desperately lacking an emperor. Only slavery (and its surrounding economic and political issues) had the power to propel white Southerners to disunion and, ultimately, war. Ironically, by taking a course that led to a war that they lost, the Confederates themselves launched the juggernaut that led to emancipation. To understand how freedom and justice came, why it was delayed for a century after the Civil War and why today so much mistrust and misunderstanding persists between black and white Americans, the vital starting point remains the Confederacy. Should African-Americans even care about the individual “heroes” of the Confederacy? It might help to know that some of them were black too, including men like the enslaved Charleston steamer pilot Robert Smalls, who boldly stole a Confederate steamboat on May 13, 1862, and took his family and the families of his crew past the cannons ringing Charleston’s harbor to reach freedom with the blockading Union fleet. More interesting might be those brave Southern black men and women who carried on a clandestine opposition during the war to help the Union. And many might be surprised to learn of the tens of thousands of white Southerners who opposed both slavery and the Confederacy. After the war, a few leaders even accepted the new U.S. order and espoused full citizenship for freedmen. Without preserving the Confederate story, we risk losing the memories of all those other genuine heroes. In the end, Americans cannot afford to forget the Confederacy. It is a good thing that the Confederacy failed—not least because a permanently divided America would have had neither the strength nor the worldliness to confront the next century’s totalitarian menaces. But the Confederate experience also teaches lessons about Americans themselves—about how they have reacted in crisis, about matters beyond just bravery and sacrifice that constitute the bedrock of our national being. The Confederacy was almost as deeply riven with dissent as the U.S. is today, and yet it stopped short of draconian restrictions on free speech (at least for the whites it considered full citizens). By their own lights, its leaders overwhelmingly remained committed to constitutional authority and elected civil government—even in the last year of the war, when the military situation grew so desperate that some prominent leaders called for the unconstitutional overthrow of President Davis and the installation of Lee as military dictator. To the end, the Confederates’ leaders believed in democracy as they conceived it. In the last months of the war, some of their civil and military leaders, briefly including Lee himself, worked to bring about a negotiated peace with the North that would have ended slavery and the Confederacy in return for guarantees of continued government in the Southern states by the consent of the white population. The Confederates were seen at the time as traitors by the North, and they are seen as racists down to the present day, but in the main, they sincerely believed that they were holding true to the guiding principles of democracy. To paraphrase Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, America has ever been a laboratory for that democracy. The Confederacy is its most notable failed experiment. The debate over the relation of the states to the federal government had been present since independence. The idea that secession was an alternative if conflicts over sovereignty couldn’t be resolved arose often enough that it was likely to be tried eventually, and so the Confederates tried. They failed. But good scientists don’t erase their laboratory failures; they learn from them. Even today, separatist voices rail against the federal government, call for radical localism and sometimes embrace secession as a solution to parochial issues. The Confederate experience is there to remind them that going it alone means losing vastly more than there is to gain. American democracy is ever-changing, a constantly evolving work in progress. We shall be fortunate if it remains ever thus, but we need to remember our entire past in all its dimensions to inform the process and keep it alive. Ossification is the first step on the road to extinction for great ideas. Dr. Davis is a former executive director of the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech. He is the author of many books on the Civil War and Southern history, including “Crucible of Command: Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee—The War They Fought, the Peace They Forged.”",

Mad Men would have been a different show if Matt Dillon had played Don Draper. Ironically, the success of Don Draper/Jon Hamm has attracted Matt Dillon to his own much hyped TV star vehicle. But Wayward Pines (Showcase, Thursday, 8.30pm) isn't worth the detour. True Detective has its fans, but I'm not one of them.

Remove the stars and there is nothing to follow at all in this stand alone/sequel thing that we know as True Detective 2 (Showcase, Monday, 7.30pm). Nobody is blaming Patricia Arquette's acting chops or star power for the failure of CSI: Cyber (Ten, Sunday, 9pm) to gain traction. This hard-working Oscar winner deserves a weekly paycheck, but the CSI franchise hobbles as it turns for home, like the riding-school pony that deserves to be retired. The obvious rather cynical injection of some \"cyber\" content and The Boyhood star won't be enough to keep this show on life support.

Somebody wants a new show from James Van Der Beek, Peter MacNicol and Luke Perry. Does it have to be a CSI? The worst abuse of star power right now is this season of The Blacklist (Seven, Monday, 9.15). It's a long time since James Spader was a marquee name but he does play like a big-deal movie star. He's a charismatic figure cast against a pack of nobodies, cutting a swathe through a parade of baddies stolen from Super Man comics. In this week's ugly episode, Spader's Red Reddington pits himself against the unspeakable evil of Luther Braxton (Superman-esque, right?). In the middle of a very time-critical operation that involves blowing up a secret facility designed for torturing terrorists, Red delivers a soliloquy in which he sees himself as a grotesque unlovable beast, to be pitied. With a thorn in one paw and a semi-automatic in the other, he's the hot-blooded hedonist with the heart of gold, callously gunning down any terrorist obstacle in his path, but still capable of the most tender and gentle of human emotions. That's right – most of the casualties in Red's path have choked on their own vomit, in their living rooms. The audience is dying of vomit and disgust. Spader should be sitting on a balcony, drinking scotch with Denny Crane (William Shatner in Boston Legal). A balcony, a very high balcony would be the place for David Duchovny to go after revisiting his Californication hepcat character, with a period haircut and a nose for crime, in Aquarius (Presto). Duchovny is a very watchable TV star in need of new schtick. The oversexed, unkempt outsider with a conscience is probably Red Reddington's thinner hotter cousin, and in spite of attempting his best True Detective acting, Duchovny, like so many big stars, gives us very little reason to watch. Hamer Hall, July 22 ★★★★ A girls' night out at an Amy Schumer gig is genial, dirty fun but the Trainwreck star's hour of stand-up is awkward for date night. At least at first. A night of Amy Schumer stand-up has the rhythm of a great night out at the pub. Photo: Getty Images Women in the sold-out Hamer Hall laughed freely during the excellent tampon jokes but the men appeared to be on a three-second delay. But by the time Schumer rounded the corner to the Obamas' sex life, everyone had relaxed and the men were shouting out the names of the filthiest sexual positions they knew. Bless. \"Why are you hogging all the good men here?\" Schumer demanded, deadpan. Schumer described her current press tour for her movie as \"physical punishment\". Photo: Fairfax Media Though Schumer described her current press tour for her movie as \"physical punishment\", she relaxed beautifully on stage. \"Can we just have fun tonight?\" Hell yeah. The standing ovation she got as she arrived on stage was the loudest I've heard since the Taylor Swift concert. She does share some of Swift's mix of focus-pulling charisma and oversharing girlfriend vibe. \"This doesn't leave the room,\" she whispers. Hah. Many of the anecdotes would be familiar to a local fan Googling all her clips. But what was fresh was the sustained exposure to Schumer's gifts as a stand-up. It's not just the easy patter or the comfortable way she stops mid-story to rebuke somebody talking in the front row. It's her fabulous physicality: the way she switches from tiny sarcastic mincing moves to lumbering around daring us to look. Yes, the woman we know from her much-shared 12 Angry Men clip still talks a lot about how Hollywood can't deal with her weight, such as the trainer who winced when he saw her \"like when you're trying to be brave for a burns victim\". But she did at least acknowledge that her life has changed big time – now she also has to tell paparazzi jokes. The Schumer we get on stage isn't quite as cut-throat as the one we've got to know through her show Inside Amy Schumer. There's no joke as thrilling as A Very Realistic Military Game. On stage, she only nominated one joke about accents for \"tomorrow's angry blog\", and it wasn't that transgressive. Ultimately, a night of Amy Schumer stand-up has the rhythm of a great night out at the pub: at first it's genial and gossipy, as she tells us all about hanging out with Mindy Kaling and making fun of Katie Couric. But as Schumer warmed up, it got simultaneously looser and sharper. Like friends in a bar after a few too many, she led us into the too-much-information zone where she could tell us anything and we'd love her for it.",

Read More [Editor’s Note: Be sure to join IGN and Harmonix for the world gameplay premiere of Rock Band 4 in our live stream on Friday, May 15 at 12pm PT/3pm ET/7pm GMT. That's 5am AEST on Saturday.] Many would agree that Rock Band 2 was the peak of Rock Band’s campaign design. Rock Band 4 aims to outperform the 2008 game’s limited story elements and band interaction with a simple, strong new feature: Gigs. “A gig is a new structure that we’ve put into Rock Band 4 to sort of capture the feeling of a live performance,” Lead Designer Chris Foster told IGN. It’s also an incredible way to have an extra layer of fun, or cause tension with, the people you’re playing with. Here’s hoping Rock Band 4 doesn’t cause any band breakups. You'll 'as a band' be able to vote on a setlist. Foster explained that the act of performing live music isn’t represented completely accurately in previous Rock Band games. You don’t hop on stage, play a song, and leave. “It’s sort of the ebb and flow of the arc of a performance over successive songs. So, like, the crowd coming with you, or potentially you needing to win them over…it’s a sense of momentum and pacing. So what we wanted to do with this is capture the sense of a gig and use it for narrative means, for new gameplay and emotional experiences within the Rock Band framework.” Essentially, Gigs operate similar to older games’ Setlists, or Rock Band 3’s Challenges. “It’s a series of songs subdivided into a series of sets with set breaks,” said Foster. A Gig we played involved four songs in two sets of two. A set break between each duo had stuff we’ve never seen in Rock Band before. “If you’re the vocalist, you’re able to perform a sort of stage patter…it’s sort of like adding some LARPing to your Rock Band experience,” Foster said. “You’re sort of role-playing a different event that is sort of happening offstage, or got you to the show in the first place inside the campaign, we’re using them to deliver the narrative experience.” So what does that mean, gameplay-wise? “They need to be really fun to play,” Foster said. “Particularly as the crowd is reacting. So, you’ll do your crowd work as a vocalist, the band will play a couple of songs, and then you’ll take another break. And in those breaks, you’ll be able to do a lot of voting. In some cases, there’ll be a set list that is predefined, like in previous Rock Bands. But in other cases, you’ll – as a band – be able to vote on a setlist.” Choices appear between sets, drawn from your music library and the gig’s theme/genre. Bandmates have a limited time to choose the song they all wish to play -- which could lead to interesting, awkward interactions with you band. Your guitarist may decide on a spectacular, fun song the vocalist doesn’t know, or can’t sing to properly. An exhausted drummer can vote for something laid-back, while the rest of his bandmates troll her with a gnarly drum solo track. “It becomes a really interesting collaborative and competitive experience, as you’ll have people say what they want and what they absolutely don’t want,” Foster said. “It’s fun, because when you’re beat-matching, it’s tunnel vision; you’re focused on your instrument, you’re barely aware of other people if they’re falling out or if you can save them. But the moments between songs, we’re able to come up with these other game experiences, and they can be really fun.” Fighting or messing with your band isn’t necessarily to your advantage of course. You can carry over your multipliers and Overdrive power between songs during gigs, adding a small but interesting extra layer of strategy that can affect your band’s score. Gigs can be played for kicks in a party setting, for sure, but they’re also core to Rock Band 4’s campaign -- which involves an interesting branching narrative similar to an RPG. We’ll have more on that for you later this month.

    "DiffbotBody": "Peggy Woolsey Given the bacon mania sweeping the nation, it's not too difficult to imagine that Ari Miller, founder of the local bacon and charcuterie outfit 1732 Meats, is truly living the dream. Sitting in the office of his new production space in Yeadon, he explains, \"I'm the luckiest man on the face of the planet. I have a beautiful wife and amazing children who are so much smarter than me, and I can get up every morning and go to a job that I like doing. You can't beat that.\" Add a few slices of his signature Garlic Insanity bacon, a whiff of the lamb prosciutto that he has curing in the newly opened wholesale production facility, plus a roster of fantastic restaurants that have been using his meats regularly for a while now, it's not hard to understand where Miller is coming from. But like most people who are living the dream (whether bacon is involved or not), the story and the meats have been in the works for a while. Born in the Bay Area, Miller's childhood father-son bonding time was spent frequenting farmers markets, searching out the greasiest of greasy spoons and driving to Napa in search of small-production stinky cheeses. With a background like that, Miller's love of eating percolated on the back burner while he pursued a career in banking. The move to Philly happened in November 1998 by way of his wife and 1732 Meats partner, Elise. \"When a pretty lady says she'll marry you, you move,\" Miller says. Back then the food scene in Philly was nothing like it is today. Vetri was in its first years and aside from a handful of major players like Le Bec-Fin and Susanna Foo, the bar was pretty low, at least in Miller's recollection. \"There were five or six restaurants at the top and then there was a precipitous drop to everyone serving bad hoagies and cheesesteaks,\" he says. It was around that time that Miller set out to make his first batch of bacon. One fortuitous day a craving for garlic bacon came that he couldn't shake. It wasn't a product that he'd sampled before, nor was it available at the city's small selection of gourmet grocers. So in his typically industrious fashion, Miller bought himself a copy of the definitive Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking andCuring by Michael Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn. After an in-depth search for an essential curing ingredient, sodium nitrite (these were the days before everything-Amazon), Miller's amateur bacon-making experiment was up and running. Miller says that his wife likes to joke that he doesn't know how to cook for two or four people; when he hits the kitchen, there's enough for the whole neighborhood. And after a while, he started getting the response that so many gifted home cooks often receive when friends and family taste their wares: \"This is so fantastic! You should really go into business.\" Working as a branch manager of a Main Line bank, Miller's knowledge of customer service and what makes a successful business had been honed well enough for Miller to know that the restaurant business was not for him. But he was looking for a change. He decided to go back to school, not for cooking or hospitality, but for law. About a year and a half into taking night classes at Temple and working full time, he realized that becoming a lawyer wasn't his calling either. But instead of dropping out, he finished his degree and opted not to take the bar exam. \"I graduated in 2013,\" Miller says. \"And all I could see is massive amounts of free time and I don't do well with free time. I need something to do.\" Miller lives with his wife and two daughters in a Lansdowne home built in 1732 (hence his company's name) as part of the borough's founding farm. With a home base like that, his connection to the community runs deep. Seeing a lack of meat vendors at the weekly Lansdowne farmers market, Miller decided that it would be an ideal outlet for his bacon, and a way to combat all of that spare time. When he ran the idea by his wife, she had her fair share of reservations. \"Elise said to me fatefully, 'OK, but we're going to keep it small.'\" Miller explains. \"And I said, 'Absolutely.'\" With a 9,100-square-foot plant in Yeadon that opened in April, it's clear that Miller might not have told the full truth when talking to his wife that day, but that's not really a bad thing. Currently 1732 Meats makes four varieties of bacon (Garlic Insanity, black peppercorn, jalapeño and Spanish smoked paprika) and is getting ready to roll out a line of charcuterie in the next week or so that includes everything from pancetta to sumac-cured Wagyu bresaola, along with Italian classics like coppa and guanciale. Miller's meaty dreams are paying off big time. His meats can be purchased at all of the Di Bruno Bros. and Green Aisle Grocery locations as well as at the Fair Food Farmstead at Reading Terminal, and his charcuterie is going to hit the menus of plenty of restaurants in town very soon, including Brigantessa and Capofitto.",

Eventually, Kletterwerks gave birth to Mystery Ranch, which has systematically become the premier backpack for ski touring and trekking, even providing product direct to military and firefighting personnel.

    "DiffbotBody": "Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Specification Our Verdict There is simply nothing out there quite like the Google Chromecast. It's a brilliant and cheap way to get smart apps onto your older TV, and comes highly recommended. Works flawlessly It's easy to set up and use Lots of apps It's so cheap! No remote control Still some apps missing Go to page: Update: Chromecast is getting a $15 ethernet adapter! Chromecast, pure and simple, is an inexpensive media streaming adapter that turns any HDMI-equipped television into an app-driven smart TV when paired with a phone, tablet or computer. The diminutive package is Google's answer to products like Apple TV, Roku 3 and the Amazon Fire TV – all of which are designed to take your digital content and streaming services like Netflix, Sling TV and Amazon Prime Instant Video and get them up on your big screen without fuss or fiddle. But whereas the competition uses fancy interfaces to hold content and run on complex operating systems, Google's little streamer is content just sitting there and waiting for your other devices to tell it what to stream. More impressive, though, is its price. From day one the Chromecast wowed with its cheap price and it can now be had for as little as $32. It's similarly bargainous in the UK: just £30 - less than a third of the Apple TV's RRP. On launch, the services that tied in with Chromecast were limited and very much a work in progress. But 15 months on, the list of compatible apps is impressive. Most of the big hitting services are now compatible, with Netflix, YouTube, Vimeo, Hulu Plus, Pandora, HBO Go, Starz and Showtime Anytime etc... all ready and waiting in the US, and BT Sport, BBC iPlayer and more in the UK. You can find a complete list of Chromecast-compatible apps on the Google Chrome Store. Music is really restricted for UK users, with even the lone Pandora app support no good for us due to licensing restrictions. The key addition here would be Spotify, but there's a wide range of services that could become available. The truth is that the 'casting' method of getting video onto your TV is simply not very compatible with music. We're sure that this will change (Google can be very persuasive…), but there are major limitations on built-in support at the moment. Google's Chrome browser on Mac or PC lets you mirror a browser tab to your TV, meaning that you can theoretically send any of these services to your TV that way, but there are issues with this. If you stream video via the compatible apps, the content is streamed directly from the internet to Chromecast without traveling via your phone or tablet. But if you mirror a browser tab, you're effectively streaming video to your computer from the internet via your router, then streaming it back to your router and then streaming it out once more to your TV, resulting in heavy network traffic. If your network is flaky, this will result in choppy performance. We tested on a variety of networks and found results were variable but a clear network (around 8-10Mbps down) should be able to handle it. Browser streaming options are Extreme (720 high bitrate), High (720p) and Standard (480p). Using Chromecast, though, it's clear that it's designed for use with portable devices in mind. You won't find a Chromecast remote in the box or a main menu tying all of the apps together like on an Apple TV or Roku 3. Recent firmware updates have soothed this problem giving users the ability to use their TV remote to control some functionality, but at the end of the day you'll still need to keep a device running the app within arm's reach. Chromecast rivals All streams originate from a special \"Cast\" button that's built into each compatible mobile app - your device is the remote. Currently, Windows Phone 8 users, who don't have many options among app-filled streaming technology, are totally out in the cold for Chromecast support, with only third party YouTube app TubeCast being compatible. So Chromecast is only really suited to those with Android and iOS devices. Despite these limitations from the big names, Chromecast has extra potential to it thanks to developers getting creative with the Google Cast SDK. Apps like AllCast enable Android and Apple iOS users to display video and photos through the Chromecast. Which is useful since Google somehow neglected to add this feature to Android. Both major media center apps, VLC and the Plex app will happily stream to Chromecast, which is perhaps the best way to get your library of downloaded videos up on the big screen. Photo Caster is a free app that enables iOS users to put their photos on-screen similarly. Media Browser is an app for iOS and Android that streams media content stored on any computer in the house, giving the Chromecast home theater PC (HTPC) granting capabilities. You can even stream Podcasts from a few apps. The way Apple integrated its AirPlay streaming solution deep into iOS means that it inevitably has better support when combining an iOS device with an Apple TV, but as long as developers continue to use the Cast SDK, we will inevitably see almost as widespread support for cross-platform solutions - iOS, Android and Chromecast all working together seamlessly. Sure, Roku has its Roku SDK, but it's easier for many developers to make their apps compatible with the Android-based Chromecast. It requires a little bit of retooling rather than learning an entirely new ecosystem, as is the case with the Roku. Between its universal nature, rock-bottom price and ease of setup, Chromecast is massively tempting as a little TV add-on. Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Specification Go to page: Chromecast finally gives Android owners an official media-relay option that broadcasts content from their smartphones and tablets to a TV in similar way to Apple's AirPlay technology. That it works across Android, iOS, PC and Mac is even better. There's a \"Cast\" button that's usually built into the top right of all of the compatible mobile apps - it looks like a rectangle with broadcasting bars (like a Wi-Fi symbol) in the corner. The Cast button appears automatically next to compatible content It's easy to recognise, despite Android being full of similar rectangles these days (and Apple's AirPlay symbol being somewhat similar). Tap the \"Cast\" button and you'll be offered a list of Chromecast devices on your network, so just choose which one and you'll see the screen spring into life, loading the video or audio content you selected. The app then becomes a remote, basically, enabling you to control the screen. The likes of Netflix even give you a custom screen on the device, ditching playing the video there as well in favour of big buttons for controlling playback easily. One press and you can throw your video to your TV Video quality is great from most online sources - Netflix in HD looks as good as you'd hope. We did encounter some freezing issues towards the end of a film, but pausing and restarting got us back in action. Netflix is also capable of streaming from the website on PC or Mac natively (not using the tab mirroring feature) to Chromecast, but when we tried this, the audio was often a tiny bit out of sync. Not enough to make it unwatchable, but it was a bit distracting. Most of the time, when you send video over to the Chromecast, it picks up quickly. Generally, once you've started playing a video, you can exit the app and start doing other things - and this applies both to mobile and desktop. This means Chromecast can act as a second screen in a couple of cases, particularly when used with desktops or Android devices, letting you browse the internet or do something else on the computer while a tab with your Gmail, Twitter feed or a video is running in a \"casted\" background on the big screen. Google also announced at its developer conference that it would release new software that would enable Android phones and tablets to work as controllers for some Chromecast games. However, it's not suitable as a second screen option for work; it's just a mirror of something you've already got open, so if you want to interact with it, it needs to be done on your main computers screen. There's also noticeable two-second lag between the computer and the TV. That's a similar amount of consistent lag experienced when using Apple AirPlay mirroring on a Mac computer, but it is at least consistent - it doesn't suddenly hang or get choppy, for the most part. But here's where AirPlay mirroring from a Mac shows up Chromecast's limitations: the browser extension is just that - browser-based. Casting a browser tab is as easy as adding the Chrome extension Showing off a photo you retouched in Photoshop, a document you want a group to proofread in Word, or any program outside of the Chrome browser tab you're casting requires diving deeper into an options menu for a hidden command that's deemed \"experimental\" by Google. It's buggy and slower than Apple TV's full computer mirroring. Chromecast is not meant for mirroring system-wide applications -at least not yet. App limitations The Chromecast tab extension is also limited to Chrome at the moment and may never work outside of the Google-owned browser. That means FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera users are out of luck if they had hoped to \"Cast\" using their favorite browser. While Google has opened up the Chromecast API for building applications, it's still forcing everyone to use Chrome for tab casting from a computer. All this for just £30 - what's not to like? Chromecast also doesn't require an entire Apple TV device to sit in your entertainment console or force you to wire up with a lengthy power, HDMI and optional Ethernet cable. Its plug-and-play nature means that it can be transported much more easily and fit into a backpack to carry to a school presentation or business meeting (we used Apple's iCloud version of Keynote to show a presentation from a Chrome tab), hotel room, or friend's TV. That flexibility may be worth its inexpensive price alone. There is one potential of inflexibility, though. The total lack of built-in apps or direct method of control (such as a dedicated remote) means that if your device runs out of battery or is in another room, you can't play anything. We had a few little niggles, such as a photo-casting app that forgot the Chromecast after each use and had to hard quit and restarted. Most of these are probably up to developers to fix, though, and as things mature, we expect they'll improve. Current page: Content and performance Previous Page Design and interface Next Page Verdict Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Specification Go to page: Google's take on an AirPlay like universal streaming service is hugely impressive, not just for its price, but because it works well, on many platforms. It's possibly the perfect companion device to an older TV with no smart features, and it's certainly the cheapest way to get Netflix up and running in your living room if you can't plug in any other compatible devices. We hope that developers will also be able to work in some other interesting Chromecast options for the future, provided the technology allows it - something equivalent to the big-screen gaming that AirPlay enables for Apple users would be great to have cross-platform, for example. That said, this option is now being covered in Google's forthcoming Nexus Player, so don't expect Google Chromecast to get gaming features any time soon. We liked Chromecast is brilliantly easy to set up, gave us little hassle after the first few minutes, and then worked really well. You quickly become accustomed to the idea of just reaching for your phone and beaming something over to it - just like the future should be. The streaming quality is generally very good, and it's quite reliable, especially for a product that's still fairly early in its life. It's also impressive that it works so well on all platforms. At $30/£30, we definitely like the price. It's well into impulse-buy territory, and we do think it's worth picking one up just for its potential, even if you already have a way to stream the services it currently works with. We disliked The lack of apps was the simple, major problem when Chromecast originally launched. It was fairly well-supported in the US, but elsewhere it needed fleshing out... and it has been. The only thing you might dislike about Chromecast is its reliance on the phone in your pocket or the tablet on your coffee table. But for anyone who keeps those things with them, it's not a problem and in fact for many it's a more convenient way of arranging things. There are a few other things we'd like to see, such as a bit more polish to improve things further – faster loading of videos in some apps, broader support in basic Android apps, stronger streaming from desktops, for example. Verdict Chromecast is an inexpensive, easy-to-use way of accessing streaming on your TV. All the major video streaming apps are compatible and you soon find yourself using it on a daily basis. If it cost more, we'd say it might be worth looking at the Amazon Fire TV or the Nexus Player, but at this price how can you possibly argue? Chromecast is fun enough, robust enough and has enough potential that thoroughly recommend it to anyone without a smart TV.",

Yahoo has provided some clarity on it's approach to Fantasy Premier League for the upcoming season as well as given a hint about where it is likely to be going in the future. Oh, and there's been a lot of exciting news from the transfer market too. It's a lot to get to so let's get started. PremierLeague.com Launch The granddaddy of them all is back for the 2015-16 season and, along with updated prices and new players entering the league, there are some new featuers that fantasy managers should be aware of. The game launched yesterday so everyone who has been tipped off to that fact has likely seen the three new \"boosts\" that managers will have at their disposal on a one-time basis throughout the season. The two original boosts, the transfer wildcard and the captain, are still around but those in charge of the PL.com game have added three new wrinkles for managers to deploy during the season in an attempt to gain an advantage - All Out Attack, Triple Captain, and Bench Boost. All Out Attack - This boost allows managers to deploy a 2-5-3 line-up in an effort to receive points from more attacking players for the week the boost is deployed. The value of this boost is at least somewhat dubious as the change you're being allowed to make - essentially substituting a forward for a defender compared to a 3-5-2 alignment - isn't clearly an advantage. If you have struck gold with a Harry Kane-like bargains at forward and in midfield with players you were expecting to have on the bench most weeks and want both counting at the expense of a defender then there is a clear value. Otherwise, at least based on last seasons' performances, outside of the top couple of forwards, defenders and forwards yield similar results meaning a 2-5-3 and a 3-5-2 aren't likely to produce markedly different results for most people who use this boost. In fact the greater depth and lower cost of defenders is such that you're probably better off going 3-5-2. Triple Captain - Your designated captain receives double points in a standard week and this boost sees that the captain's total tripled the week it is applied. The obvious time to use this boost is when a player worthy of being your captain - Hazard, Costa, Sanchez, etc. - plays two matches in a game week. Bench Boost - Likely the most valueable of the three new boosts, the Bench Boost gives you points for your entire squad for the week you play it instead of your team only receiving points for the players in the starting line-up. There are two criteria associated with when you are likely to want to use this boost. First, you want to use it at a time when you're feeling pretty good that everyone in your squad is healthy and going to start. Second, you want as many starts as possible over the 15 players in your squad. The schedule doesn't forecast weeks that include multiple matches yet but cup competitions and weather cancellations will inevitably produce a few and the key will be playing the schedule to get as many players as possible in your squad with two matches to get the most from this boost. It may well make sense to use this in conjunction with a wildcard unless you happen to be able to adjust your roster with the standard transfer allocation to get yourself ready for the optimal Bench Boost week. My Early PL.com Line-up After a very brief amount of time poking around through players and prices, here's what I've come up with for my initial squad. Please remember that we have just under a month of transfers and pre-season injuries to go before the Premier League actually kicks off so my actual season-starting line-up may or may not look much like this: GK: Boaz Myhill (4.5) - West Brom start off with Manchester City so I'm unlikely to have Myhill starting but at a price of 4.5 and based on how he performed last season after Ben Foster went down, he's got a place in my squad somewhere. GK: Jack Butland (4.5) - With Asmir Begovic looking unlikely to return, Butland should be a strong bargain in a Stoke City side that should be solid-but-not-spectacular again this season. D: Joleon Lescott (5.0) - A bummer to see his price go up and the early season schedule will likely see Lescott on the bench early but he's another who is highly likely to be a bargain over the course of the sesason. D: Patrick van Aanholt (5.0) - I was hoping he would come in at 4.5 but I'm bullish on his potential, especially if Sunderland improve to be the mid-table team that their budget implies they should be. D: Cedric (5.0) - Everything everyone wrote about Clyne/Bertrand going into last season applies to Cedric this season. He should be a significant bargain and he gets Newcastle to kick off the season. D: Branislav Ivanovic (7.0) - He's probably going to start declining at some point in the next couple of years as a player but we said the same thing about John Terry and look what the return of Mourinho did for his career, Ivanovic should be one of the top producers again this season. D: Hector Bellerin (5.5) - Not nearly the bargain he was over the second half of last season but still solid value assuming he keeps the starting spot over Mathieu Debuchy. M: Eden Hazard (11.5) - No reason to think his results will decline after a summer that saw him get some much needed rest. He's as good a candidate as anyone to be the highest point producer in the game again. M: Theo Walcott (9.0) - With Walcott healthy again and Alexis Sanchez unlikely to start Arsenal's first couple of matches after Copa America duty, it's hard to imagine that Walcott isn't a starter. Arsenal's early-season schedule is pretty light and Walcott seems like the best path to the resulting points. M: Christen Eriksen (8.5) - This would be Cesc Fabregas' spot but Sergio Aguero is unlikely to be ready to start the season after the Copa America which puts Diego Costa in my squad and maxing out my Chelsea contingent. I considered Eriksen, Cazorla, and Silva for this spot and went with Eriksen despite the season-opener at United. He's 1.5 cheaper than Silva and I'm still not sure what's going to happen with Santi Cazorla's playing time with Wilshere, Ramsey, and Oxlade-Chamberlain all healthy. He should start but I have this sneaking concern that, at some point this season, Cazorla becomes a reserve. M: Yannick Bolasie (6.5) - He has looked great under good managers - Pulis and Pardew - and has been overlooked by lesser ones. Pardew seems locked in for the coming season and the thought of Cabaye spraying passes to Bolasie and Puncheon is too much to pass up at 6.5. M: Matt Ritchie (6.0) - I haven't seen him play but the potential for a bargain is there if he can even produce a significant fraction of his Championship statistics from last season (15 goals, 17 assists). F: Diego Costa (11.0) - I explained my logic under the Eriksen note, he started off the season in fantastic form and assuming his hamstrings have returned to something like normal health over the summer he's a no-brainer as your lead forward with Aguero unavailable to start the season. F: Callum Wilson (5.5) - I'm all in trying to replicate the Charlie Austin/Danny Ings magic from last season with bargain forwards and I think Wilson has the best chance to be the guy based on his young age and rapid ascent through the professional ranks. F: Troy Deeney (5.5) - I'm a little less sure on Deeney since he has made it to 25-years-old without someone making a \"Godfather Offer\" to get him to the Premier League before this season. Still, he's not ancient by any stretch of the imagination and taking chances on he and Wilson give me lots of strength elsewhere in my squad. Yahoo Announcement #1 Yahoo yesterday confirmed what we have long suspected. There will not be a Premier League fantasy game from the Silicon Valley-based company for the 2015-16 season. You can read more about it from our old friends at NeverManageAlone.com or see the original Yahoo Help post on the topic here if you don't believe me. There is some reason to believe that the Yahoo season-long Premier League format isn't totally dead (queue Princess Bride quotes about it being only mostly dead here). You can see some of the reason for hope in this Tweet. The other reason for hope comes from Yahoo's second recent fantasy-related announcement. Yahoo Announcement #2 Earlier this week, Yahoo announced the launch of it's own Daily Fantasy Game platform to compete with FanDuel.com and DraftKings.com. They were vague in the video embedded on this page about exactly what would be rolled out and when but Major League Baseball Daily Games are already live. It is a 100% certainty that an NFL game will follow when the NFL season kicks off in September as well. There's just too much popularity associated with the NFL and fantasy for Yahoo to do this and not have NFL ready. The Premier League is a different story, my guess is that, like FanDuel.com, Premier League looks like a good idea for Yahoo but that it will be a secondary priority because the money in PL daily games just doesn't match the league's popularity right now for a variety of reasons that could probably spawn their own feature-length article. Now, I'm not just announcing an uncertain timeline for Yahoo Daily Fantasy for Premier League to put something vague out there, there is a potential positive impact on the Yahoo Season Long game even if it isn't going to come to fruition this season. Yahoo believes that their advantage in entering the Daily Fantasy Game market late is that they can create opportunities for players with teams in free season-long league to enter those season-long teams in Daily Games for money. For Yahoo to realize this advantage in the Premier League market it, of course, means that they'd have to actually have a Season-long Game available to boost trial and repeat usage of the Daily Game. My overall takeaway between these two announcements from Yahoo is that there is hope that we will see some version of Yahoo Season-long Fantasy for the Premier League as soon as the 2016-17 season. Fingers crossed that I'm reading the tea leaves correctly. The Transfer Market - Old Trafford Exits The obvious storyline here is that Manchester United are putting themselves in a very precarious position right now. I don't know that anyone would argue that the ideal scenario for the Red Devils includes selling off spare parts and even making some big moves to replace high profile players who just didn't work out. Falcao has already gone. Robin van Persie seems THISClose to joining him. Nani has been an afterthought for a couple of seasons now and has left for Turkey and Rafael seems likely to join him shortly. Certainly individually, none of those moves would be a concern and even collectively, they're not THAT concerning. The news today has Angel di Maria leaving Old Trafford for Paris Saint-Germain. Oh, and there's the David De Gea drama lurking in the background as well. So, what's the concern? That's a lot of inbound transfer work to be done with the selling clubs holding all the leverage with Manchester United having already sold the players being replaced. There is also the fact that United had some holes to fill already before they started selling. Assuming that di Maria and De Gea do leave as reported then the list for United looks something like this: Goalkeeper Right Back (although Darmian appears very close) Center Back Holding Midfielder Starting Forward Reserve Forward By waiting, United have seen Petr Cech (who, granted, didn't seem to want to leave London) and likely Asmir Begovic removed from the list of potentially available goalkeepers. If Hugo Lloris is serious in saying that he doesn't want to move and Spurs decide they won't be tempted then United's options within the Premier League are almost nil. Outside the Premier League, Ajax would have a ton of leverage to extract a huge transfer fee for Jasper Cillessen if he is the next option on United's list. The same holds true for other positions. Southampton don't seem to be feeling any pressure to sell Morgan Schneiderlin for anything less than what they deem maximum value. Assuming clubs with forwards that could interest United know that there is a big wad of cash sitting around the Old Trafford coffers after an Angel di Maria sale then there's no reason to think that United won't be held to ransom there as well. There is still plenty of time before the window closes at the end of August but United's summer is starting to look more like last summer where they waited to buy. They certainly managed to bring in big names late last summer but given that Luke Shaw was something of an early bust, Falcao is gone, di Maria looks set to follow, Rojo looks like a reserve, and Blind is the Dutch John O'Shea you'd think that they'd try a different approach this summer. Cabaye Arrives What a coup for Crystal Palace! Yohan Cabaye should be very well rested after not playing a lot for PSG for two seasons and he joins a team that needs exactly what he brings. Palace have grit at the back in the form of Scott Dann and Mile Jedinak. They have potent wing play and speed in the attack in the form of Bolasie, Puncheon and Zaha. What they need is a creator to bring it all together which is exactly what Cabaye offers. There is still work to do in the transfer market if the funds are available - a center forward (Charlie Austin has been rumored and would be a perfect foil for Cabaye and all that speed outside), better outside backs, and a younger starting goalkeeper would make for the perfect summer. That said, Palace had a strong second half of last season without any of those things and now they've added Cabaye to the mix. Things are looking up at Selhurst Park. An Underrated Departure Steven N'Zonzi doesn't get a lot of publicity. He plays perhaps the least glamorous position for an unfashionable club. Make no mistake, he is an excellent player and at the root of Stoke City's solidity under Mark Hughes. His departure to Sevilla this week is a massive hole that the Potters need to fill if they are to continue to build on Hughes' success in his first two seasons. I was hoping that Arsenal might pick up N'Zonzi as a partner/deputy for Francis Coquelin as a defensive midfielder but it's hard to deny N'Zonzi a starting spot on a Champions League club for the upcoming season. Smart buy for Sevilla and Hughes will be challenged to find a player of sufficient quality to replace N'Zonzi who wants to move to Stoke. That's a lot to digest for one day, we'll be back with more as the news continues to break.

D: Hector Bellerin (5.5) - Not nearly the bargain he was over the second half of last season but still solid value assuming he keeps the starting spot over Mathieu Debuchy. M: Eden Hazard (11.5) - No reason to think his results will decline after a summer that saw him get some much needed rest. He's as good a candidate as anyone to be the highest point producer in the game again. M: Theo Walcott (9.0) - With Walcott healthy again and Alexis Sanchez unlikely to start Arsenal's first couple of matches after Copa America duty, it's hard to imagine that Walcott isn't a starter. Arsenal's early-season schedule is pretty light and Walcott seems like the best path to the resulting points. M: Christen Eriksen (8.5) - This would be Cesc Fabregas' spot but Sergio Aguero is unlikely to be ready to start the season after the Copa America which puts Diego Costa in my squad and maxing out my Chelsea contingent. I considered Eriksen, Cazorla, and Silva for this spot and went with Eriksen despite the season-opener at United. He's 1.5 cheaper than Silva and I'm still not sure what's going to happen with Santi Cazorla's playing time with Wilshere, Ramsey, and Oxlade-Chamberlain all healthy. He should start but I have this sneaking concern that, at some point this season, Cazorla becomes a reserve. M: Yannick Bolasie (6.5) - He has looked great under good managers - Pulis and Pardew - and has been overlooked by lesser ones. Pardew seems locked in for the coming season and the thought of Cabaye spraying passes to Bolasie and Puncheon is too much to pass up at 6.5. M: Matt Ritchie (6.0) - I haven't seen him play but the potential for a bargain is there if he can even produce a significant fraction of his Championship statistics from last season (15 goals, 17 assists). F: Diego Costa (11.0) - I explained my logic under the Eriksen note, he started off the season in fantastic form and assuming his hamstrings have returned to something like normal health over the summer he's a no-brainer as your lead forward with Aguero unavailable to start the season. F: Callum Wilson (5.5) - I'm all in trying to replicate the Charlie Austin/Danny Ings magic from last season with bargain forwards and I think Wilson has the best chance to be the guy based on his young age and rapid ascent through the professional ranks. F: Troy Deeney (5.5) - I'm a little less sure on Deeney since he has made it to 25-years-old without someone making a \"Godfather Offer\" to get him to the Premier League before this season. Still, he's not ancient by any stretch of the imagination and taking chances on he and Wilson give me lots of strength elsewhere in my squad. Yahoo Announcement #1. Yahoo yesterday confirmed what we have long suspected. There will not be a Premier League fantasy game from the Silicon Valley-based company for the 2015-16 season. You can read more about it from our old friends at NeverManageAlone.com or see the original Yahoo Help post on the topic here if you don't believe me. There is some reason to believe that the Yahoo season-long Premier League format isn't totally dead (queue Princess Bride quotes about it being only mostly dead here). You can see some of the reason for hope in this Tweet. The other reason for hope comes from Yahoo's second recent fantasy-related announcement. Yahoo Announcement #2. Earlier this week, Yahoo announced the launch of it's own Daily Fantasy Game platform to compete with FanDuel.com and DraftKings.com. They were vague in the video embedded on this page about exactly what would be rolled out and when but Major League Baseball Daily Games are already live. It is a 100% certainty that an NFL game will follow when the NFL season kicks off in September as well. There's just too much popularity associated with the NFL and fantasy for Yahoo to do this and not have NFL ready. The Premier League is a different story, my guess is that, like FanDuel.com, Premier League looks like a good idea for Yahoo but that it will be a secondary priority because the money in PL daily games just doesn't match the league's popularity right now for a variety of reasons that could probably spawn their own feature-length article. Now, I'm not just announcing an uncertain timeline for Yahoo Daily Fantasy for Premier League to put something vague out there, there is a potential positive impact on the Yahoo Season Long game even if it isn't going to come to fruition this season. Yahoo believes that their advantage in entering the Daily Fantasy Game market late is that they can create opportunities for players with teams in free season-long league to enter those season-long teams in Daily Games for money. For Yahoo to realize this advantage in the Premier League market it, of course, means that they'd have to actually have a Season-long Game available to boost trial and repeat usage of the Daily Game. My overall takeaway between these two announcements from Yahoo is that there is hope that we will see some version of Yahoo Season-long Fantasy for the Premier League as soon as the 2016-17 season. Fingers crossed that I'm reading the tea leaves correctly. The Transfer Market - Old Trafford Exits. The obvious storyline here is that Manchester United are putting themselves in a very precarious position right now. I don't know that anyone would argue that the ideal scenario for the Red Devils includes selling off spare parts and even making some big moves to replace high profile players who just didn't work out. Falcao has already gone. Robin van Persie seems THISClose to joining him. Nani has been an afterthought for a couple of seasons now and has left for Turkey and Rafael seems likely to join him shortly. Certainly individually, none of those moves would be a concern and even collectively, they're not THAT concerning. The news today has Angel di Maria leaving Old Trafford for Paris Saint-Germain. Oh, and there's the David De Gea drama lurking in the background as well. So, what's the concern? That's a lot of inbound transfer work to be done with the selling clubs holding all the leverage with Manchester United having already sold the players being replaced. There is also the fact that United had some holes to fill already before they started selling. Assuming that di Maria and De Gea do leave as reported then the list for United looks something like this: Goalkeeper Right Back (although Darmian appears very close) Center Back. Holding Midfielder Starting Forward. Reserve Forward. By waiting, United have seen Petr Cech (who, granted, didn't seem to want to leave London) and likely Asmir Begovic removed from the list of potentially available goalkeepers. If Hugo Lloris is serious in saying that he doesn't want to move and Spurs decide they won't be tempted then United's options within the Premier League are almost nil. Outside the Premier League, Ajax would have a ton of leverage to extract a huge transfer fee for Jasper Cillessen if he is the next option on United's list. The same holds true for other positions. Southampton don't seem to be feeling any pressure to sell Morgan Schneiderlin for anything less than what they deem maximum value. Assuming clubs with forwards that could interest United know that there is a big wad of cash sitting around the Old Trafford coffers after an Angel di Maria sale then there's no reason to think that United won't be held to ransom there as well. There is still plenty of time before the window closes at the end of August but United's summer is starting to look more like last summer where they waited to buy. They certainly managed to bring in big names late last summer but given that Luke Shaw was something of an early bust, Falcao is gone, di Maria looks set to follow, Rojo looks like a reserve, and Blind is the Dutch John O'Shea you'd think that they'd try a different approach this summer. Cabaye Arrives What a coup for Crystal Palace! Yohan Cabaye should be very well rested after not playing a lot for PSG for two seasons and he joins a team that needs exactly what he brings. Palace have grit at the back in the form of Scott Dann and Mile Jedinak. They have potent wing play and speed in the attack in the form of Bolasie, Puncheon and Zaha. What they need is a creator to bring it all together which is exactly what Cabaye offers. There is still work to do in the transfer market if the funds are available - a center forward (Charlie Austin has been rumored and would be a perfect foil for Cabaye and all that speed outside), better outside backs, and a younger starting goalkeeper would make for the perfect summer. That said, Palace had a strong second half of last season without any of those things and now they've added Cabaye to the mix. Things are looking up at Selhurst Park. An Underrated Departure. Steven N'Zonzi doesn't get a lot of publicity. He plays perhaps the least glamorous position for an unfashionable club. Make no mistake, he is an excellent player and at the root of Stoke City's solidity under Mark Hughes. His departure to Sevilla this week is a massive hole that the Potters need to fill if they are to continue to build on Hughes' success in his first two seasons. I was hoping that Arsenal might pick up N'Zonzi as a partner/deputy for Francis Coquelin as a defensive midfielder but it's hard to deny N'Zonzi a starting spot on a Champions League club for the upcoming season. Smart buy for Sevilla and Hughes will be challenged to find a player of sufficient quality to replace N'Zonzi who wants to move to Stoke. That's a lot to digest for one day, we'll be back with more as the news continues to break.

Taking a look at the key stats from last season to highlight every teams’ top performers and give us a steer for the upcoming campaign. Lastly, the men at the sharp end – the Forwards… All players must’ve played 10 matches to be considered and have been measured in the following categories: Appearances (Apps), Goals (Gls) and Assists (Ass). Players are listed per team, in recommended order of Fantasy value, or appeal for next season. *Playing for Man United Forward thinking: Diego Costa will be top of many manager’s wish list and rightly so. Only started 24 matches which might be a slight concern – and he does like a booking, but expect more of the same from Diego. Ramadel Falcao will adopt the Drogba role so poor old Loic Remy doesn’t even get promotion to chief bridesmaid. Forward thinking: Sergio Aguero is very much the man at Man City. No guarantees as to where Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko will be playing their football next season. Or how much game time Wilfried Bony will get. Forward thinking: These two shared the central strikers role last season but Olivier Giroud hogged all the goals. Danny Welbeck’s versatility will get him plenty of game time, but when it comes to end product this is a mis-match. Man United Apps Gls Ass Robin van Persie 25 (2) 10 2 Forward thinking: Wayne Rooney is not the most spectacular pick – or player – as he once was but as close as you’ll get to a guarantee in the PL. A quiet-ish season for United and Wazza last season so could represent a spot of value. Robin van Persie played a surprising number of matches – more than Costa – but never looked right. Whoever replaces him is of much more interest… Forward thinking: Whether Harry Kane can pick up where he left off last time is one of the burning questions of pre-season. Head and shoulders Spurs’ best option though and likely to produce the goods again. But you’ll have to pay for it this time… Forward thinking: Looking at this lot makes you feel a bit sorry for Brendan Rodgers. If Sturridge stays fit then Rodgers and any FL managers prepared to take a punt will be smiling. Lambert and Borini will be squabbling for bench space and Mario is as fragile as Daniel Sturridge’s thigh muscles. Forward thinking: Pelle’s numbers are decent, but much of best work was done in the opening quarter of the season – much like Southampton. I’ve a feeling he might have been found out and is a candidate for ‘second season syndrome’. If he – and his team-mates – repeat last season’s heroics, he will have done very well. Forward thinking: During a spectacular last quarter of the season – where Gomis scored six of his seven goals - the sale of Bony looked like a shrewd bit of business. Next season he will be joined by Portuguese striker Eder who is of similar stature (i.e. monstrous). Not sure there will be room for both in the team (or dressing room). Forward thinking: Diouf had a solid season and we can expect at least the same again. Walters is the next best pick - if categorized as a Forward, that is – with Crouch’s dubious gifts diminish and question marks over Bojan’s fitness. Forward thinking: Palace’s 10th place finish was all the more remarkable when you consider that no Forward played more than 15 matches, or scored more than seven goals. Midfield is the area to plunder for FL managers unless Palace can add the Charlie Austin or Loic Remy-type they hanker for. Forward thinking: For me, Lukaku flatters to deceive a little bit – and last season was his least productive in three. But he remains the stand out Everton Forward and focal point of their attack. West Ham Apps Gls Ass Andy Carroll 12 (2) 5 1 Enner Valencia 25 (7) 4 3 Forward thinking: Like West Ham started like a man on fire, scoring seven of his ten in the opening quarter of the season. Looks The Hammers best option though with Carroll’s delicate ankles and Valencia yet to convince in the PL. Forward thinking: On the face of it, 14 is a good return from Berahino. But his managers had to endure an eight-match and a ten-match barren spell during the campaign. Seems the streaky type to me (i.e. hot or cold, nothing in between). Handle with care. Forward thinking: Vardy stole most of the headlines, probably because his real emergence coincided with Leicester’s Houdini act. But Ulloa had a decent season in a largely struggling team. Kramaric scored zillions in Croatia before his January move if you fancy a cheap wild-card… Forward thinking: Cisse has goals in him, that much we know. But he is also prone to the odd disappearing act – during matches and in the treatment room. If McClaren can get 30 matches out of him, he’ll get a goal return in the teens. But suspect buying someone in is the more reliable route. Forward thinking: Just 15 goals between three strikers tells us that if Sunderland bring in a striker he will immediately be their most desirable. Defoe, at least, has PL pedigree so might be a consideration for a third choice if you are low on funds. Otherwise pass. Forward thinking: If manager Tim Sherwood can ‘do an Adebayor’ on Benteke he could be a snip. He could also end up Liverpool and has the Euros as an inspiration, so there is plenty to like about Benteke. Plus, Villa surely can’t be as bad again, can they? Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. Goals won’t be as easy to come by playing with the big boys, of course. But their last season stats will give us a few clues about what we can expect… Forward thinking: Kermorgant and Pitman contributed massively to Bournemouth’s success, but Callum Wilson has the look of being this season’s Charlie Austin or Danny Ings. Well worth a look. Forward thinking: Whether Ighalo, Yvdra and Abdi are categorized as Forwards or Midfielders will have a big impact on their FL value. If Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson is this season’s Danny Ings, Deeney is the Jamie Vardy – he was playing for non-league Halesowen less than a decade ago. Forward thinking: Jerome has plenty of PL experience is certainly the pick here. But has been a scoring of great goals, rather than a great goal scorer. Pick well and be lucky, friends.

Whoever replaces him is of much more interest… Tottenham. Apps. Gls. Ass. 28 (6) 21. 4. Roberto Soldado. 7 (17) 1. 1. 9 (4) 2. 1. Forward thinking: Whether Harry Kane can pick up where he left off last time is one of the burning questions of pre-season. Head and shoulders Spurs’ best option though and likely to produce the goods again. But you’ll have to pay for it this time… Liverpool. Apps. Gls. Ass. 7 (5) 4. 1. 7 (18) 2. 2. 3 (9) 1. 1. 10 (6) 1. 0. Forward thinking: Looking at this lot makes you feel a bit sorry for Brendan Rodgers. If Sturridge stays fit then Rodgers and any FL managers prepared to take a punt will be smiling. Lambert and Borini will be squabbling for bench space and Mario is as fragile as Daniel Sturridge’s thigh muscles. Southampton. Apps. Gls. Ass. 37 (1) 12. 2. 16 (16) 5. 5. Forward thinking: Pelle’s numbers are decent, but much of best work was done in the opening quarter of the season – much like Southampton. I’ve a feeling he might have been found out and is a candidate for ‘second season syndrome’. If he – and his team-mates – repeat last season’s heroics, he will have done very well. Swansea. Apps. Gls. Ass. 16 (13) 7. 0. Forward thinking: During a spectacular last quarter of the season – where Gomis scored six of his seven goals - the sale of Bony looked like a shrewd bit of business. Next season he will be joined by Portuguese striker Eder who is of similar stature (i.e. monstrous). Not sure there will be room for both in the team (or dressing room). Stoke. Apps. Gls. Ass. 28 (6) 11. 3. 28. 8. 4. 17 (16) 8. 2. Bojan Krkic. 14 (2) 4. 1. Forward thinking: Diouf had a solid season and we can expect at least the same again. Walters is the next best pick - if categorized as a Forward, that is – with Crouch’s dubious gifts diminish and question marks over Bojan’s fitness. Crystal Palace. Apps. Gls. Ass. 9 (8) 7. 3. 11 (14) 5. 1. Frazier Campbell. 13 (7) 4. 0. 15 (3) 2. 0. Forward thinking: Palace’s 10th place finish was all the more remarkable when you consider that no Forward played more than 15 matches, or scored more than seven goals. Midfield is the area to plunder for FL managers unless Palace can add the Charlie Austin or Loic Remy-type they hanker for. Everton. Apps. Gls. Ass. 32 (4) 10. 5. 22 (9) 6. 0. Forward thinking: For me, Lukaku flatters to deceive a little bit – and last season was his least productive in three. But he remains the stand out Everton Forward and focal point of their attack. West Ham. Apps. Gls. Ass. 20 (3) 10. 2. Andy Carroll. 12 (2) 5. 1. Enner Valencia. 25 (7) 4. 3. Forward thinking: Like West Ham started like a man on fire, scoring seven of his ten in the opening quarter of the season. Looks The Hammers best option though with Carroll’s delicate ankles and Valencia yet to convince in the PL. West Brom. Apps. Gls. Ass. Said Berahino. 32 (6) 14. 1. 13 (11) 4. 2. Victor Anichibe. 11 (10) 3. 1. Forward thinking: On the face of it, 14 is a good return from Berahino. But his managers had to endure an eight-match and a ten-match barren spell during the campaign. Seems the streaky type to me (i.e. hot or cold, nothing in between). Handle with care. Leicester. Apps. Gls. Ass. Leonardo Ulloa. 29 (8) 11. 3. 16 (13) 5. 2. 26 (8) 5. 8. 6 (7) 2. 0. Forward thinking: Vardy stole most of the headlines, probably because his real emergence coincided with Leicester’s Houdini act. But Ulloa had a decent season in a largely struggling team. Kramaric scored zillions in Croatia before his January move if you fancy a cheap wild-card… Newcastle. Apps. Gls. Ass. 11 (11) 11. 1. Ayoze Perez. 25 (11) 7. 0. 15 (8) 1. 1. Forward thinking: Cisse has goals in him, that much we know. But he is also prone to the odd disappearing act – during matches and in the treatment room. If McClaren can get 30 matches out of him, he’ll get a goal return in the teens. But suspect buying someone in is the more reliable route. Sunderland. Apps. Gls. Ass. Conor Wickham. 31 (5) 5. 1. 20 (10) 5. 2. 17. 4. 0. Forward thinking: Just 15 goals between three strikers tells us that if Sunderland bring in a striker he will immediately be their most desirable. Defoe, at least, has PL pedigree so might be a consideration for a third choice if you are low on funds. Otherwise pass. Aston Villa. Apps. Gls. Ass. 26 (3) 13 2 Gabriel Agbonlahor. 30 (4) 6. 1. Forward thinking: If manager Tim Sherwood can ‘do an Adebayor’ on Benteke he could be a snip. He could also end up Liverpool and has the Euros as an inspiration, so there is plenty to like about Benteke. Plus, Villa surely can’t be as bad again, can they? Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. Goals won’t be as easy to come by playing with the big boys, of course. But their last season stats will give us a few clues about what we can expect… Bournemouth. Apps. Gls. Ass. 45. 20. 7. 26 (12) 15. 10. 18 (16) 13. 2. Forward thinking: Kermorgant and Pitman contributed massively to Bournemouth’s success, but Callum Wilson has the look of being this season’s Charlie Austin or Danny Ings. Well worth a look. Watford. Apps. Gls. Ass. 37 (5) 21. 9. Odion Ighalo. 22 (13) 20. 3. 31 (11) 16. 5. 24 (4) 9. 2. Forward thinking: Whether Ighalo, Yvdra and Abdi are categorized as Forwards or Midfielders will have a big impact on their FL value. If Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson is this season’s Danny Ings, Deeney is the Jamie Vardy – he was playing for non-league Halesowen less than a decade ago. Norwich. Apps. Gls. Ass. 36 (9) 20. 7. 16 (16) 12. 6. 23 (13) 12. 3. Forward thinking: Jerome has plenty of PL experience is certainly the pick here. But has been a scoring of great goals, rather than a great goal scorer. Pick well and be lucky, friends. Matt Nesbitt is a one-time player, long-time tipster and full-time fan of the beautiful game.

    "DiffbotBody": "She may be a member of one of the country's most powerful families, but even Ivanka Trump's three-year-old daughter Arabella is powerless when it comes to the weather - even when she performs an adorable song and dance in the hopes of ensuring some sunshine. 33-year-old Ivanka shared a precious video of Arabella, dressed in a Snow White costume while standing on a children's table singing about the weather. As she waves her arms back and forth, she can be heard belting out: 'Oh Mr. Sun. Sun. Mr. Golden Sun. Please shine down on me,' while her one-year-old brother Joseph sings along in the background. 'Arabella, hoping for sunshine the best way she knows how - hamming it up for the camera,' Ivanka captioned the video, which she posted to her Instagram account on Thursday. Nearly 5,000 people have liked the video since it was posted, with many people praising Ivanka for being such a hands-on mother. 'Love when you share photos and videos of your kids! Business woman, mom and wife! Keep it up! #inspiration,' one commenter wrote, while another added: 'You are genuinely the epitome of a WORKING MOM. 'You are truly an inspiration to those of us, esp. In NYC who strive for that Balance. Kudos to YOU! [sic].' Meanwhile, others noted that Arabella, whose mom often snaps pictures of her playing dress up, has developed a particular penchant for emulating Disney princesses. 'I feel like Arabella lives in that dress,' one person noted of the little girls Snow White costume, while another added: 'She's always wearing a Disney gown lol. Cute [sic].' And while the weather in New York City has had its fair share of rain this summer, Arabella did manage to get a pool day in last week. Ivanka snapped a sweet picture of her daughter in a floral one piece and purple sunglasses as she lounged in shallow water, writing, '#poolparty' on the Instagram caption. The former model and her mini-me have been having a great summer so far. Arabella is a budding ballerina, and for their latest girls' night out last week the mother-of-two treated her eldest child to a night at the ballet. The mother-of-two, who took her daughter to see American Ballet Theatre's production of Cinderella at Lincoln Center in New York City, shared an adorable video of Arabella playing by the plaza's fountain before the show. In the clip, which was posted to Ivanka's Instagram account that night, a surprised Arabella can be seen gleefully running back and fourth every time the fountain's water shoots in the air. Ivanka's stylish eldest child looked right at home at the ballet, wearing a pale pink dress featuring white rosettes at the hem. Always one to accessorize, Arabella topped her look with glittery flats, a matching purse worn across her chest, and a bow in her hair, which was pulled back into a low ponytail. 'Night at the Ballet! #lincolncenter,' Ivanka captioned the video, which shared with her 553,000 Instagram followers. More than 10,000 people have liked the video, with many commenting on Arabella's picture perfect ensemble. 'Love that Arabella has her little crossbody happening. #alwaysaccessorize,' one wrote, while another added: 'She's such a beautiful young lady. Love the outfit.' The next morning, Ivanka also posted a photo of Arabella posing angelically by the fountain, writing: 'Last night at the ballet...' Ivanka's daughter and her son Joseph frequently star on her mother's social media accounts as the Celebrity Apprentice star often shares photos of her adventures with her children and husband Jared Kushner. Earlier this month, Ivanka helped Arabella set up her first lemonade stand, with the profits from the sale going to 'the hungry children of New York'. 'The sun is out and our lemonade stand is ready! #open4business,' she captioned the snapshot of the pink stand decorated with yellow balloons. Many commenters praised Ivanka for instilling a strong work ethic in Arabella at such a young age. 'Business 101 from young age. That's how you raise children to be successful. Well done Ivanka.' one person wrote, while another added: 'Now that's one awesome lemonade stand! I'd buy some!' But before Ivanka and her children opened their lemonade stand, it was a rainy Sunday, and the blond beauty snapped a precious picture of Arabella kissing her bunny lamp while her brother watched her every move. 'Baking brownies, playing Candy Land and kissing bunnies on this rainy Sunday morning!' Ivanka wrote. And the brownies that they made ended up being sold at their lemonade stand later in the day. Ivanka, who introduced her father Donald before he announced his presidential bid last month, is the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization.

The Mountain View-based tech company launched Gmail Postmaster Tools on Thursday to help users filter messages and senders gather more information about reaching their target audiences, according to its Gmail blog. The company is using \"an artificial neural network to detect and block the especially sneaky spam — the kind that could actually pass for wanted mail.\" In addition, Google says its system is getting better at recognizing bulk messages users actually need. “Gmail users get lots of important email from companies like banks and airlines — from monthly statements to ticket receipts — but sometimes these wanted messages are mistakenly classified as spam,” Sri Harsha Somanchi, Google product manager, wrote in the blog post. “When this happens, you might have to wade through your spam folder to find that one important email (yuck!).

    "DiffbotBody": "Crowds generated from vacation Bible school likely deter crime, a parishioner says Tyler Burkholder, who works at Tidings of Peace Mennonite Church, looks over the 300 block of East Poplar Street in York with his wife, Sarah. The church runs a school of about 40 students from K-12. Tyler Burkholder, 21, said outreach programs commonly involve large groups of city kids. 'I have a heart for the kids,' he said. 'I made bad choices as a kid, and I'd like to see them do better than I did and better than some are doing now.' (Jason Plotkin — Daily Record/Sunday News) It is documented in the Bible that Christians congregated in cities, Tyler Burkholder said. A city full of Christians would be able to reach more people. Burkholder is a parishioner at Tidings of Peace Mennonite Church, an East Poplar Street fixture in York's Olde Towne East neighborhood for nearly 60 years. He works as a logistics coordinator for the church's school and helps run their outreach programs in York. Living and working in the city, about a block away from a June 2014 fatal shooting, helps Burkholder and his church reach city youth, he said. The school's enrollment is roughly 40 from K-12, but its vacation Bible school had 130 kids this past week, almost all from the city, Burkholder said. Tidings of Peace solicits neighbors to attend their services, but word-of-mouth brings a lot of attendants. Thursday nights throughout the year are like small-scale vacation Bible schools, said Sarah Burkholder, Tyler's wife. That ministry draws between 50 and 80 people. Sarah, 25, is from Lancaster. Tyler Burkholder, who is originally from Missouri, is 21. It is his goal in life to help kids learn important life lessons without experiencing gangs or violence. The couple feels safe in the city, living in an upstairs apartment at their 318 E. Poplar St. church. The block used to be worse, he said, but the church benefits from having some great neighbors, people who actually care. He thinks the Bible study crowds deter crime in the area. \"I have a heart for the kids,\" Tyler Burkholder said. \"I made bad choices as a kid, and I'd like to see them do better than I did and better than some are doing now.\" Contact Mark Walters at 717-771-2032.

Thursday nights throughout the year are like small-scale vacation Bible schools, said Sarah Burkholder, Tyler's wife. That ministry draws between 50 and 80 people. Sarah, 25, is from Lancaster. Tyler Burkholder, who is originally from Missouri, is 21. It is his goal in life to help kids learn important life lessons without experiencing gangs or violence. The couple feels safe in the city, living in an upstairs apartment at their 318 E. Poplar St. church. The block used to be worse, he said, but the church benefits from having some great neighbors, people who actually care. He thinks the Bible study crowds deter crime in the area. \"I have a heart for the kids,\" Tyler Burkholder said. \"I made bad choices as a kid, and I'd like to see them do better than I did and better than some are doing now.\" Contact Mark Walters at 717-771-2032.

    "DiffbotBody": "SEOUL | Samsung Electronics Co is bringing forward the launch of a key premium smartphone model, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday, as the South Korean tech giant seeks to revive sales after a sluggish second quarter. The world's top smartphone maker will launch a new version of its Galaxy Note phablet in mid-August, the person said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Previous versions, such as the Note 3 and 4, typically launched in September. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment. The mid-August launch will likely put the new Note smartphone model on the market ahead of arch-rival Apple Inc's next iPhones. The U.S. company is preparing for its largest initial production run for new phones so far by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Samsung is seeking to rebound from a disappointing 2014, when its annual profit hit a three-year low as smartphone earnings slumped. Though Samsung's earnings are recovering, its second-quarter guidance of a 6.9 trillion won ($6.11 billion) operating profit fell short of market expectations following a supply shortage for the curved-screen version of its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone. \"I don't know how much the earlier launch will help boost the company's average selling price for smartphones, but this suggests that Samsung will work hard to maintain its market share for the high-end market,\" said HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon.

    "DiffbotBody": "Fitness and lifestyle expert Jay Bradley is a big proponent of eating foods in their purest form as often as possible. “Our bodies love foods that are close to their natural state because they are jam-packed with potent phytonutrients, vitamins, minerals, and live enzymes,” he explains. “Eating raw promotes better digestion, stronger immunity, more physical energy, younger-looking skin, and so much more!” Sounds good to us! But since switching to an all-raw diet is a little more of a commitment than most of us are willing to make, Bradley shares his top 10 picks for the most important foods to eat raw. “Always buy organic whenever possible to avoid harmful chemicals, pesticides, and toxins,” he advises. 1. Berries Bradley says: “Fresh or frozen berries are low in sugar and rich in antioxidants, not to mention delicious and easy to digest. I always do my best to start the day with fresh blueberries.” 2. Avocado Bradley says: “High in fiber, potassium, vitamin E, and healthy unsaturated fats, avocados also provide protein and live enzymes. Enjoy in a salad, shake, or sandwich.” 3. Coconut Bradley says: “Coconut water is high in electrolytes and rich in potassium. The meat contains protein and healthy fats with four times more fiber than oat bran. Try coconut ice cream. It is rich and delicious.” 4. Raw Green Juice Bradley says: “Fresh, raw juice of celery, parsley, cilantro, kale, spinach, cucumber, and other greens nourishes our body with enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The juice acts as a wonderful detoxifier. Try using a blender to keep all of the healthy fiber intact.” 5. Wheatgrass Bradley says: “Very high in chlorophyll, minerals, and other nutrients, wheat grass or any type of sprouted juice gently detoxifies our bodies. You also can choose raw superfood powders that contain wheatgrass and other essential raw greens.” 6. Raw Honey Bradley says: “Raw honey is the ONLY 100 percent predigested food on the planet. It works to promote healing, healthy digestion, and immune strength.” 7. Chia Seeds Bradley says: “Chia contains high levels of phytonutrients, fiber, and essential fats and acts to lubricate our joints and bowels and remove toxins. Add chia to your cereal, salad, or a blended drink.” 8. Olives and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Bradley says: “Olives and olive oil are very high in antioxidants, healthy fats, and vitamin E. They assist the body and skin with inflammation and work to reduce cholesterol in the blood. I love olive oil and lemon dressing.” 9. Raw Dairy Products Bradley says: “Raw dairy is not easy to find for legal reasons, especially in certain provinces and some states. Raw dairy products such as kefir, yogurt, milk, and cheese from cows, sheep, and goats are rich in vitamins, live enzymes, probiotics, healthy fats, and protein.” 10. Marinated Raw Fish Bradley says: “Sushi, sashimi, and ceviche (marinated fish) are loaded with live enzymes, probiotics, healthy fats, and fat-soluble vitamins.” Important: “It may not be advisable for people with compromised immune systems to consume raw, unpasteurized dairy products,” Bradley notes. “Always consult your physician before starting a new diet.” Jay Bradley has been a lifestyle coach for over a decade and has a really positive attitude towards making changes that will change the way you live. Pulling from many of his life experiences, he has created a program and “way of life” for people looking to enhance the way they feel about themselves. His book Live Look Feel will be coming out next month and takes readers through a 12-week journey to become more accountable for your choices when it comes to fitness, nutrition, and lifestyle and guides you through gentle introspection.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s been a rough few weeks for Sarah Palin… Last month, the country was shocked when her daughter Bristol Palin called off her wedding to Sgt. Dakota Meyer just days before it was set to take place amidst claims he had been married to a “secret wife” years before. Weeks later, it was revealed that Bristol is currently pregnant with her second child out of wedlock, and she has no plans to get married anytime soon. In the middle of those scandals, Fox News parted ways with Palin when they decided not to renew her million dollar contract last month. Now, Palin has just quietly announced that she will be shutting down the subscription-based sarahpalinchannel.com just a year after it debuted. According to Mediaite, the site offered exclusive Palin content for an annual subscription fee of $99.95, and they will now be giving a refund for the remainder of the year to all customers. Here’s the full statement the Palins put on the website: Effective August 1st, the Governor will be making all of her content free on her Facebook page and at SarahPac.com. • If you are a monthly subscriber here on SarahPalinChannel.com, you will not be charged anything after this month. There’s nothing that you need to do. • If you are an annual subscriber, you can have the balance of your subscription refunded to your credit card or you can roll your subscription into one of the other channels on our network. If you choose this option, you’ll get an EXTRA month absolutely FREE. Our networks include: – New Life TV – Recharge your relationships and grow closer to God – Alive with Joan Lunden – A vibrant community for women’s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors – K-Love TV – Christian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values Palin also issued a video message in which she did her best to make the change look like a positive thing. “It’s starting August 1st, everything’s free, and just to let you know, that it is an honor to have you subscribe, really it’s been so illuminating and still is so illuminating to read and to respond to many of your insightful comments about current events, about so many things going on in our world today,” Palin said in her video message. She went on to claim that this decision to make all content free stems from a desire to, “make sure that your voices and mine are heard by the widest possible audience across this great land of ours” during the next election. While this sounds nice, it also reveals that Palin was not getting the amount of subscribers she was looking for. She would not be making all the content free if she was making a good amount of money with subscribers, so this change reveals that Palin is not doing as well business-wise as she might have thought. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the entire Palin family. We need to keep them in our prayers!",

Since we introduced a model for a paid Website, the focus of marketing is not so much on reach but on conversion, activation, and engagement. Our job as digital marketers is to bring as many people as possible to the paywall and convert them. But that’s not enough. Once readers take the step of paying for our content, we need to activate them as well. Many new members get a subscription because of a promotion (the iPad that goes with the subscription is quite often more important than the newspaper). Subscribers not only need to have a subscription, they must also use the subscription. The leaked New York Times memo put it this way: “We are putting less effort into reaching reader’s digital doorsteps than we ever did reaching their physical doorsteps.” At De Standaard, we are looking for ways to market and re-market the content to activate the digital reader as much as possible. That’s what we did with Tot aan de Ijzer. This is the first spread of Tot aan de Ijzer, which was debuted in the newspaper on July 28, 2014. That date was exactly 100 years after Austria declared war on Serbia, setting off World War I. This was the start of a series of articles in De Standaard that lasted for more than three months, discussing the German invasion of Belgium. Tot aan de Ijzer – “to the river de Ijzer” — is a detailed historic reconstruction of what happened when German soldiers invaded Belgium in August, took the major Belgian cities one by one, and were halted around Ypres. The series reported on the invasion, military movements, and political impact. De Standaard also published testimonials of civilians, soldiers, priests, nurses, writers, and the like, shedding a light on how the war was survived by the population. Much attention was paid to photography, drawings, cartoons, and infographics — a classic piece of journalism. We used to think our work was done after we put publish. Now we know it only starts after the publication. With the first publication, a promotional campaign drew the reader’s attention to the series. We communicate with in-newspaper ads, by mail, shared pieces on social media to give non-subscribers a taste. We bundled the series well, permitting the reader to easily find the articles. Three months later, a second cycle begins. We re-bundled the content into an ebook and promoted it through another channel. dS Avond is an app with evening news published at 5 p.m. Readers had to download dSA each day and start saving points from the edition. At the end of the week, a full saving card entitled you to an ebook-version of Tot aan de Ijzer (this was the first activation). And at the end of the year, we recycled the ebook and offered it with the print edition as a Christmas gift (voucher with unique download code inserted in the newspaper). By clicking on the box of the day, a coupon appears in the evening edition of dS (dS Avond). Every coupon counts for a downloaded issue of dS Avond. With the second activation, we offered the ebook with the newspaper and had extra newsstand sales of almost 3,000 copies during the weekend. Moreover, these buyers had to register so we collected extra data from an interesting group of non-subscribers. In terms of digital activation, it was a great tool: subscribers activated their digital account to read, and digital readership increased. As the content is the editors’ property, you don’t have any fee or royalty. So this is an extremely cheap way of marketing. A second example of this type of promotion is a photobook called Altijd Ergens — a bundle of pictures of Michiel Hendryckx, a famous Belgian photographer who published his photos in dS Weekblad, our weekend supplement. We also made an ebook of this album and promoted dS Avond by using the same mechanism of saving daily coupons. This was also a big success, but more interesting were the diagrams of both promotions. When you compared the readers of Tot aan de Ijzer with those of Altijd Ergens, we saw that there was only a small percentage of common readers. The target group of downloaders was a different set of people each time. An observation you might like to consider: don’t use the same type of content to promote or activate your brand. Try to vary and appeal to different groups of people. If you can offer a reading incentive once in a while to everybody, your activation policy will be more successful.

Plano is just half of the dynamic French duo behind the newly-opened breakfast and lunch spot along Gravenstein Hwy. (next to Mom's Apple Pie).

In fact, it’s gone altogether. After just three years, the upscale/retro Fagiani’s Bar/The Thomas restaurant is shuttering. Call it the curse of the building, which was the site of the town’s most notorious murders, or the revolving door of chefs that came and went from the restaurant. Whatever the reason, the NYC hospitality group behind the 2012 opening, AvroKo, is reinventing the restaurant as Ninebark (the name refers to a woody bush native to the region). What’s really captured our attention: AvroKo has partnered with Michelin-starred wunderkind Matthew Lightner to open the restaurant and handle all of their West Coast culinary operations. And that means not just a new Napa restaurant, but whispers of a second restaurant in Calistoga, and likely other left coast eateries. Lightner rose to fame as executive chef of Castgna in Portland, Oregon, then received two Michelin stars in NYC after opening Atera. His new focus for the restaurant and rooftop bar will be “California-focused, market-forward cuisine based around “innovative preparation techniques”, with proposed menu items like scallops with bottarga, seaweed and buttermilk; skewers of fatty tuna, shiso, peppercorns and sorrel and savory porridge with smoked fish, heirloom rice and sourdough. The Thomas/Fagiani’s is slated to close at the end of July, and Ninebark will hopefully open in early August. Call us stoked. The Patio coming to Petaluma? Rumblings that SoCal's Patio Restaurant Group is eying Petaluma for their next restaurant. The wildly popular San Diego restaurants (three Patio locations, Swell Cafe, The Front Porch shop and the forthcoming Fire Side Cafe) have acknowledged the rumors, but officially say they’re still in discussions about the grand opening and logistics. “It will be part of The Patio Group family,” said reps.

    "DiffbotBody": "What a difference a year makes. Last summer, you couldn't set foot in public without hearing about how \"fancy\" Iggy Azalea is. In 2015, however, the Aussie femcee is about as popular as Crocodile Dundee and other short-lived trends from Down Under. It's been over a week since news of the Josh Duggar sexual abuse charges was made public, and the usually outspoken 19 Kids and Counting clan has been uncharacteristically quiet ever since. Both Josh and his parents issued public statements shortly after the accusations were revealed, but many of their fans and critics believe the responses were woefully inadequate. Ready for a second helping of Cookie? Fox has announced a premiere date for Empire Season 2, which will be comprised of 18 total episodes and broken into two nine-episode halves. Vanderpump Rules stars Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix were named the Sexiest Couple of 2015, an actual award handed out by OK! Magazine. And what worthy winners they are! Just look at these two hotties! Earlier this week, we reported that Calvin Harris was caught cheating on Taylor Swift, and rather than penning a tearful ballad about like she would've in her crimped-hair \"country\" days, Swifty simply confronted her new boo and told him she's having none of it. It may seem like Calvin got off easy, but sources close to Caylor say that in addition to receiving an ultimatum, the Scottish DJ was sentenced to 1,000 hours of Orange is the New Black reruns: Today in \"Tell us what you really think!\" news Mariah Carey positively went off on American Idol when asked about her stint on the show in a recent interview. Mariah didn't last very long as a judge (thanks in part to her hugely entertaining feud with Nicki Minaj), but she's been discussing the long-running series as a result of the recent news that Idol will be coming to an end after 15 seasons. Happy Flashback Friday, THG readers! In honor of this weekly occasion, we're going all the way back to 1999 with the stars of Cruel Intentions, as Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair proved yesterday that time has treated them very well. Days before the Josh Duggar molestation scandal broke, it seems his wife Anna Duggar knew exactly what storm was about to hit. She posted cryptic quote about forgiveness on Instagram, one that's easy to interpret much differently in light of what we now know. While his crimes took place well over a decade ago, it was only last week that the public learned about Josh Duggar molesting his sisters and several other young girls. A coordinated effort by the Duggars and their handlers helped keep Josh out of jail and the accusations under wraps, but now that the truth is finally out, Josh's young victims are understandably feeling that old wounds have been reopened. Like many 19 Kids and Counting fans, Bringing Up Bates stars Gil and Kelly Jo Bates are reeling from the Josh Duggar molestation scandal. For the UpTV twosome, based in Tennessee and longtime friends of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, there is little to say and a lot to pray for. Sources have confirmed that ABC has reached a new marketing low. Earlier today, the network premiered its sef-proclaimed Brokeback Bachelorette promo in which contestants Clint and JJ claimed to be \"in love.\" Last year, both Brad Pitt and George Clooney got married, and neither attended the other one's wedding. The old \"scheduling conflict\" excuses were bandied about, but are we really expected to believe that multi-millionaire A-list celebrities are incapable of taking a day off to go to a wedding? We watched them go from 16 to 19 kids (and counting!), and now it looks as though we'll see the Duggars get booted from the network that made them famous. Several advertisers have bailed on 19 Kids and Counting in the wake of the Josh Duggar molestation scandal, and today, the show was dealt another crushing blow when all episodes were pulled from the popular streaming TV streaming service Hulu. Oh, Amy Schumer. You tease, you. Earlier this week, the comedian made a special appearance on The Bachelorette, putting arrogant JJ in his place by making it clear the suitor isn't nearly as smart as he thinks. America has another would-be Commander-in-Chief joining the 2016 presidential race in former U.S. Senator and 2012 GOP candidate Rick Santorum. \"Today I announce my candidacy for President of the United States!\" the Republican from Pennsylvania, who lost out to Mitt Romney in 2012, said. From 19 Kids and Counting to 4 Adults and... well... Counting? With it seeming more and more likely by the day that TLC will cancel 19 Kids and Counting, People Magazine reports that the network is actually considering a spinoff of this popular/controversial reality show. If, as widely expected, TLC cancels 19 Kids and Counting in the wake of the Josh Duggar scandal, the network might have a replacement family. An Illinois couple that has been married for 59 years said their first hello to their 100th grandchild. Yes, you read that correctly. 100th! Conrad Hilton has been having a tough time lately. The 21-year-old cousin of Paris and Nicky was arrested for screaming death threats on an airplane earlier this year, and he could be facing serious jail time. In his interview with Diane Sawyer, Bruce Jenner claimed that despite having already begun the gender reassignment process, he hadn't yet made any changes to the his name or the ways in which he's addressed by his family members. Now, sources say Bruce has completed his sex change and some of his youngest family members have given him a new title to go with his new body. Kylie Jenner and Blac Chyna's feud has kicked back into high gear, with rumors flying that Tyga's baby mama wants to physically fight his new girlfriend. As soon as she's legal, that is.

When Toure read a quote from Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) saying he wants to replace the ACA with a more patient-centric plan, Josh Barro of the New York Times wondered: “What does that mean?” And added that “it can mean whatever the listener wants it to mean.” Toure and Kystal Ball sarcastically threw out words to dismiss Republican arguments against ObamaCare. Ball shouted, “patient centric!...cheaper!...flexible!” By Connor Williams | June 26, 2015 | 1:43 PM EDT The cheerleading for the president by MSNBC following the Supreme Court’s decision to affirm the federal subsidies in ObamaCare has been virtually ubiquitous. On the June 26 edition of Morning Joe, Eugene Robinson, Al Sharpton, and Mika Brzezinski were all jubilant about the high court’s decision, arguing that it will help to affirm the legacy of President Obama. By Curtis Houck | June 25, 2015 | 11:23 PM EDT Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling in favor of President Obama in the ObamaCare subsidy case, the “big three” of ABC, CBS, and NBC were out in full force during their Thursday evening newscasts to cheer the “historic ruling” and labeled Chief Justice John Roberts as a “conservative” after having “saved” ObamaCare “from a devastating blow.” CBS anchor Scott Pelley assured viewers in an opening tease that “[m]illions of Americans will keep their health insurance as the Supreme Court today saves the President's signature law.” By Curtis Houck | June 25, 2015 | 9:30 PM EDT Touting how “over ten million people have now signed up for health insurance under the ObamaCare law,” NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt on Thursday night trumpeted “the ObamaCare law now directly effecting so many families who say it’s been quite literally a lifesaver.” Chris Jansing delivered heartwarming anecdotes about people who have benefitted and only, at the very end of her report, did she squeeze in a brief mention of how some have been hurt. By Matthew Balan | June 25, 2015 | 12:39 PM EDT Thursday's CNN Newsroom hyped the Supreme Court's decision that again upheld ObamaCare as a \"huge win for the President of the United States,\" as Wolf Blitzer put it. Gloria Borger and John King tied the Court decision to Congress passing the President's fast-track trade legislation earlier in the week. Borger trumpeted, \"You have trade legislation being approved – huge win for the President. You have this reaffirmation of ObamaCare...huge for his legacy.\" King added, \"This may well be the best week of his second term.\" By Jeffrey Meyer | June 25, 2015 | 11:58 AM EDT Following the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision in favor of ObamaCare on Thursday, ABC News quickly touted the victory for the Obama administration with correspondent Terry Moran declaring “ObamaCare 2, conservatives 0 is the score right now.” The ABC reporter went on, in the 10 AM EDT hour special, to hype how \"once again its Chief Justice John Roberts crushing the hopes of conservatives, upholding a key section of the ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act.” By Curtis Houck | June 23, 2015 | 12:23 AM EDT The top English and Spanish-language broadcast networks again ignored on Monday night a new development in the Jonathan Gruber saga as new e-mails have surfaced that revealed how his role with the White House on ObamaCare was more detailed than previously thought. As initially reported by The Wall Street Journal, e-mails “show frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on the Affordable Care Act.” By Curtis Houck | June 16, 2015 | 9:13 PM EDT The top English and Spanish networks refused on Tuesday evening to cover the findings of a federal audit report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) that concluded that just under $3 billion in ObamaCare subsidies have been unable to be properly verified that, according to the audit, puts taxpayer funding “at risk.” While the broadcast networks ignored this story, the FNC's Special Report devoted a one-minute-and-48-second segment to the IG’s findings. By Randy Hall | June 12, 2015 | 5:10 PM EDT As Barack Obama demonstrated on Thursday, one of the best ways to ensure an interview full of “softball” questions is to bring in someone who has benefited from your policies and is happy to say so. After Jerry Penacoli and the president exchanged greetings, the Extra correspondent stated: “Thank you for inviting us. I know this is rare to have an interview sitting down with you here in the Rose Garden. It doesn't happen very often.” “It is my pleasure,” Obama stated. By Curtis Houck | June 8, 2015 | 11:20 PM EDT The “big three” of ABC, CBS, and NBC all refused to mention on Monday night comments made by President Barack Obama earlier in the day in which he attacked the Supreme Court for taking a case regarding ObamaCare subsidies and warned them not to rule that they’re unconstitutional. They remained on the sidelines as FNC's Special Report with Bret Baier worked to once again fill the void with not only a full segment, but also a discussion of it with the show’s “All-Star Panel.” The liberal website Huffington Post, that once advised readers on how to avoid talking about Obamacare during Thanksgiving dinner, surprisingly confronted a serious problem for the Affordable Care Act recently. On June 1, HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps and Huffington Posts’ senior national correspondent Jonathan Cohn about the unaffordability of Obamacare. In the segment, \"What If The Affordable Care Act Isn't Affordable?\" Cohn admitted that \"rate increases look higher\" for 2016 than in previous years, based on proposals that insurers were required to submit to the government by June 1. Companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico reportedly want to increase their premiums by as much as 50 percent. By Joseph Rossell | April 9, 2015 | 10:09 AM EDT Surprise! Millions of uninsured Americans could owe Uncle Sam extra this tax season because of Obamacare. The IRS began penalizing tax filers this year if they failed to purchase insurance in 2014. Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), included an insurance mandate. Americans must buy qualified health insurance or face the larger of two tax penalty options when they file their 2014 taxes: $95 per adult and $47.50 per child up to $285 per family, or 1 percent of income up to $9,800, according to Kaiser Health News. These penalties are also scheduled to increase dramatically in the following years. By Joseph Rossell | February 18, 2015 | 11:54 AM EST Obamacare has increased the tax burden on taxpayers and companies, a fact ignored in recent broadcast news reports. Obamacare created or hiked at least 13 taxes, Forbes reported February 17. Forbes contributor and tax lawyer Robert Wood said that for the average American, “it’s easy to be overwhelmed” by all the new taxes and forms that come with Obamacare. By Joseph Rossell | January 21, 2015 | 2:10 PM EST During his State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama said he wanted to “simplify” the tax paperwork required for small businesses, but CNBC’s Jim Cramer pointed out that Obamacare is doing just the opposite. Obama had said during his State of the Union speech on Jan. 20, that a small business owner should be able to file taxes “based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford.” However, Cramer, co-anchor of CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” said on Jan. 21, that Obama’s very own health insurance initiative had already increased, rather than decreased, the complexity of tax accounting for small businesses. By Joseph Rossell | January 6, 2015 | 12:08 PM EST The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, started creating even more headaches for both employers and employees across the country beginning Jan. 1, 2015. That was the day Obamacare’s employer mandate went into effect, requiring companies with 100 or more workers to provide health insurance to at least 70 percent of their employees. Mandates for smaller businesses will be introduced in 2016 in addition to increased mandates for larger companies, according to The Washington Post. By Joseph Rossell | December 5, 2014 | 10:56 AM EST New and expensive federal regulations stemming from Obamacare that will require many restaurants publish calorie counts probably won’t have much impact on patrons’ food choices, experts told The Huffington Post. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on November 25 that “chain restaurants, similar retail food establishments and vending machines with 20 or more locations” must post calorie counts on their menus or menu boards. The new rules were required by a provision in the Affordable Care Act. By Curtis Houck | November 12, 2014 | 6:24 PM EST During a discussion on MSNBC’s The Cycle about the disparaging comments ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber made about the law’s passage and the “stupidity” of voters, New York Times writer and substitute Cycle co-host Josh Barro sought to defend him by blasting the expectations that Americans have about health care as “completely incoherent” and lying was the only solution to make them happy. Barro told fellow panelists and guest Lauren Fox of National Journal that “what drives me crazy about this story” was that: “Jonathan Gruber was right. Public opinion on health care policy is just completely incoherent.” By Randy Hall | November 12, 2014 | 6:10 PM EST This week has been a busy time for conservative icon Glenn Beck. During his Monday program, Beck admitted to his audience at TheBlaze.com that he had been suffering from a rare neurological disease for five years, but after undergoing hormone therapy, electric stimulation and other treatments -- not to mention relying on his faith in God -- the disease has been reversed, and he's on his way to an almost total recovery. Then on Tuesday, MSNBC's Ed Schultz stated that Beck had “access and opportunity” to get the best treatment possible and declared: “I hope that his story motivates those who think that ObamaCare is bad, that maybe they will rethink” their opposition to the Affordable Care Act. By Tom Johnson | August 28, 2014 | 5:17 PM EDT The Trotskyist-turned-conservative writer James Burnham said that where there’s no solution, there’s no problem. In a Thursday post, American Prospect blogger Paul Waldman analyzed what he considers one such situation: the Republican party’s ongoing shortfall with female voters. Waldman doesn’t see how the GOP can overcome both its ideas and its tone on women’s issues. He asserted that when Republicans discuss their opposition to abortion and the contraceptive mandate, many of them “can't keep themselves from doing so in the most hostile, contemptuous ways imaginable.” By Tom Johnson | July 29, 2014 | 10:29 PM EDT According to Daily Kos writer Dante Atkins, the D.C. Circuit’s Halbig decision resembled a plot twist in a movie in which “evil” conservatives know they’ve lost the Obamacare battle but “refuse to go quietly and seek to cause as much destruction as [they] can on [their] certain path to oblivion.” Atkins wrote in a Sunday post that two factors made the court’s ruling possible: “imprecise language by the authors of the Affordable Care Act” and the “destructive psychopathy of the right wing.” By Tom Johnson | July 25, 2014 | 6:56 PM EDT What do Lee Atwater, Karl Rove, and Vladimir Lenin have in common? If you answered that they’re all Republican strategists, you’re sort of right, suggested Seth D. Michaels in a Thursday article at Talking Points Memo. Michaels claimed that GOPers are using a Leninist approach to subvert an increased government role in the health-care system. (Oh, the irony.) Specifically, they’ve taken “deliberate action to make the bad [Obamacare] outcomes they fervently wished for more likely…There’s a name for this strategy, [which] comes from Soviet Communism: ‘heighten the contradictions.’” By Tom Johnson | July 23, 2014 | 10:22 PM EDT What did conservative leaders and activists feel when they learned of the D.C. Circuit Court decision on Obamacare subsidies? Happiness? Relief? American Prospect blogger Paul Waldman seemed to have another word in mind: schadenfreude -- “satisfaction or pleasure felt at someone else's misfortune.” In a Tuesday post, Waldman opined that, sure, righties were “excited” that the ruling was a setback for President Obama and the ACA, but “what actually had them so pleased is the possibility that millions of Americans will lose their health insurance.” Republicans, he added, “will gladly crush the lives of ordinary people if it means gaining some momentary partisan advantage.”",

A panel heaped praise on Ohio governor John Kasich, particularly regarding his response to a question about Medicaid expansion. Willie Geist described it as “the best answer of the entire night that any candidate gave.” Host Joe Scarborough thought he “hit it out of the park.” John Heilemann cheered Kasich’s general performance as “Reaganesque in some ways.”",

This is a story about one media company branching out into the digital world by developing and marketing its own CMS (content management system), responsive Web sites, and apps. If content is king, than entire business should be aligned to ensure seamless content delivery to readers. What does that mean? It means that you need to establish simple yet solid infrastructure and processes that guides staff’s content to the market. The problem here is finding a good CMS that helps facilitate that. Sure, there are some great solutions for soccer moms blogging about their muffin recipes and products that are too complex for their own good. But that’s not what you need in the newsroom. That is your new revenue opportunity. So ... Define the problem: Lack of great CMS solutions for media companies available on the market.

The beautiful part is by solving your own problem, you create a market-ready product that other publishers also need. And that’s how the Styria CMS system was created. We didn’t start developing CMS on our own with the idea of monetisation in mind. Core business is still core business and solving problem at hand should drive the change. The project originally started as a solution for news portal 24sata.hr. But as it progressed, we realised that CMS could be adjusted to fit other portals in the Styria group.

Multi-site and multi-platform management that allows journalists to share content easily. Reader behaviour analytics that help editors make better content related decisions. It’s a good idea to test and pilot products internally on a smaller scale before going to the market. Our challenge was to design interface with (almost) no learning curve, since a big portion of our content creators aren’t tech-savy.

    "DiffbotBody": "Publishers are turning to the hard paywall model in part because mobile news consumption has significantly increased in recent years and online advertising revenue has primarily been consumed by Facebook, Google, and Twitter. In 2012, I began my blog with a couple of posts on paywalls. In these posts, I tried to extract what I called paywall principles – theories that could help media companies decide what kind of paywalls to institute and when to institute them. (You can read about it here.) In one of these two paywall principles, I staked a claim that the metered model was the only sensible paywall model. I proposed that, as long as a newspaper Web site has a small proportion of readers accounting for a large proportion of articles read, and a sizeable proportion of its advertising inventory unsold, it could adopt the metered model without any sizeable impact in its unique visitors and advertising revenue. Recent history has, however, not been too kind to me. The Times UK has had success of its hard paywall model with more than 170,000 subscriptions, each paying £26 per month. Recently, the Financial Times moved from the metered model, which it pioneered, to a harder paywall (albeit with a one-month trial offer for US$1). So what is happening? Is it the beginning of the end for the metered model? What lies behind the sudden resurgence of the hard paywall? To better understand this, we need to keep in mind two broad trends. First, more and more of Internet (and news) consumption is now moving to mobile. Mary Meeker’s recent Internet Trends Report states that 22% of all Internet traffic in United States (65% for India!) is via mobile devices. And this number is growing. For 2014, The New York Times saw 28 million unique visitors to its Web site via mobile devices, nearly matching 31 million desktop visitors. Is it any wonder that, as an experiment, NYT recently barred its employees from accessing the home page via desktops, forcing them to access it via mobile and tablets, to empathise with consumers interacting with the site? However, mobile is harder to monetise for publishers. The smaller screen and the nature of interaction means that very different types of advertisement units and servings succeed. Also, developing and serving these typically requires access to a huge volume of visits and interactions and the ability to invest in people and systems that can leverage and analyse that data, thereby benefitting larger platform owners such as Facebook and Twitter, as opposed to publishers. Is it any surprise that two players, Google and Facebook, control as much as two-thirds of the global mobile ad market? Secondly, online display ads, which is where publishers compete, is now cornered largely by the bigger Internet players such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Between them, the three control more than 50% of the U.S. online display ad market. In the past, smaller publishers could offer targeted and more personalised audiences (business media). Today, social media is able to offer similar targeted and even better personalised ad opportunities. Additionally, the arrival of Facebook and Twitter has resulted in a considerable supply of inventory, thus lowering CPMs for publishers. Media owners, even with as high as 10 million to 20 million unique visitors per month, do not get the volume of ads or the kind of yield they would like. They are beginning to end up with more and more low-yield ads (typically programmatic). All media owners are effectively niche publishers on the Internet! The above explains why a hard paywall model is beginning to make sense for news media. In the absence of scale, with even 20 million unique visitors not considered meaningful enough, it makes sense for news media companies to approach online ad sales the way premium publishers do.

Therefore, unlike before, there is really no incentive to drive page views or uniques by allowing casual readers to bump up volume. Instead, it might be better to show engagement and time spent by loyal visitors to ask for higher rates from advertisers. And, hence, the lack of interest in protecting visitor numbers via a metered model. I do not expect many publishers to abandon the metered model and switch to the hard paywall. Both Financial Times and The Times have the advantage of strong brand names and a loyal reader base.

    "LabBody": "Tech Trends. Why the hard paywall deserves a closer look. 22 June 2015 · By Sajith Pai. Publishers are turning to the hard paywall model in part because mobile news consumption has significantly increased in recent years and online advertising revenue has primarily been consumed by Facebook, Google, and Twitter. In 2012, I began my blog with a couple of posts on paywalls. In these posts, I tried to extract what I called paywall principles – theories that could help media companies decide what kind of paywalls to institute and when to institute them. (You can read about it here.) In one of these two paywall principles, I staked a claim that the metered model was the only sensible paywall model. I proposed that, as long as a newspaper Web site has a small proportion of readers accounting for a large proportion of articles read, and a sizeable proportion of its advertising inventory unsold, it could adopt the metered model without any sizeable impact in its unique visitors and advertising revenue. Recent history has, however, not been too kind to me. The Times UK has had success of its hard paywall model with more than 170,000 subscriptions, each paying £26 per month. Recently, the Financial Times moved from the metered model, which it pioneered, to a harder paywall (albeit with a one-month trial offer for US$1). So what is happening? Is it the beginning of the end for the metered model? What lies behind the sudden resurgence of the hard paywall? To better understand this, we need to keep in mind two broad trends. First, more and more of Internet (and news) consumption is now moving to mobile. Mary Meeker’s recent Internet Trends Report states that 22% of all Internet traffic in United States (65% for India!) is via mobile devices. And this number is growing. For 2014, The New York Times saw 28 million unique visitors to its Web site via mobile devices, nearly matching 31 million desktop visitors. Is it any wonder that, as an experiment, NYT recently barred its employees from accessing the home page via desktops, forcing them to access it via mobile and tablets, to empathise with consumers interacting with the site? However, mobile is harder to monetise for publishers. The smaller screen and the nature of interaction means that very different types of advertisement units and servings succeed. Also, developing and serving these typically requires access to a huge volume of visits and interactions and the ability to invest in people and systems that can leverage and analyse that data, thereby benefitting larger platform owners such as Facebook and Twitter, as opposed to publishers. Is it any surprise that two players, Google and Facebook, control as much as two-thirds of the global mobile ad market?

    "DiffbotBody": "STAMFORD — By all accounts, the Ridgefield 12-year old Little League team sports one of the most dangerous lineups in the District 1 tournament, needing no help to succeed, but when given a few extra outs to play with they make the opposition pay. Ridgefield twice struck out with two outs in the second inning, but both batters reached base on wild pitches, extending the inning and allowing the bats to get going. And they got going in a big way, busting out for nine runs in the second inning on the way to an 11-6 victory over Weston in the District 1 Little League double-elimination tournament at Springdale Little League Field in Stamford Friday evening. With the win, Ridgefield moves on in the winner’s bracket while Weston falls into the loser’s bracket where it will next play an elimination game Saturday against Wilton. Ridgefield coach Jeff Lacoille said the extra few chances in the second inning were a blessing to his team. “That was huge and we had a nice breakout inning,” Lacoille said. “I kind of made some mistakes out there early and they picked me up.” That breakout inning featured home runs by Johnny Briody and Jake Bongo with eight of the nine Ridgefield batters scoring in the inning and Bongo coming around twice in the frame. For Ridgefield, Bongo scored twice and had 2 RBI; Briody had 2 RBI and a double to go with his home run; Alex Hanna was 2 for 4 with two runs and a RBI and Luke Barrientos drove in two runs on the evening. Weston coach Seve Esposito said at this stage in the tournament it is tough to win when making mistakes. “We can’t do that,” Esposito said. “We are like a dark horse in this tournament because we have never gotten this far but we have done that by making no mistakes. When you start giving up 3, 4, 5 outs an inning that’s how it happens.” For Weston, Myles Lehrman was 4 for 4 with two doubles and two runs scored; Evan Levine had a home run, double and 5 RBI and Alex Olsen hit a home run and scored three runs as Weston chipped away at the lead but could not whittle it down. Weston led 2-0 in the second with Levine plating two runs with a double. Weston added a run in the fourth on Olsen’s home run and three more in the sixth on Levine’s blast. Ridgefield tacked on two more runs in the fifth, padding the lead with runs driven in by Jack Gonzalez and Diego Pepe. Ridgefield 11, Weston 6 Batteries: R - Jack Bohrer, Andrew Forsyth (2, W), Johnny Briody (4), Luke Barrientos (6) and Jason Hartnett.

    "DiffbotBody": "BENA—While school is out for summer break, administrators at the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig Schools in Bena are taking the opportunity to restructure staffing before student orientation in August. Advertisement The school board approved the hiring of an academic principal and accepted the resignations of a middle school teacher and a Niigaane teacher at Thursday's school board meeting. Niigaane is the school's Ojibwe language immersion academy. Due to personnel procedures, the names of those hired and resigning were not released. During the meeting, human resources director Bridget Sorensen said there are currently several openings being advertised in six newspapers. One vacancy is that of superintendent, currently being filled by special education coordinator Pam Walker who is acting as interim superintendent. The board accepted the resignations of past superintendent Crystal Redgrave and principal Cheryl Poitra at May's school board meeting. The resignations came after a student protest at the school in which the students asked the women resign. The school's new curriculum principal, Amanda Norman, attended her first school board meeting Thursday. Norman, from White Earth, said she is excited to begin work at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig. She has a background in teaching Ojibwe and looks forward to continuing involvement in language revitalization. Prior to joining the staff at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig, Norman taught in Ponemah and before that she was with the St. Paul school district for 11 years. \"Since I was young, I always wanted to teach,\" Norman said prior to the meeting. \"My heart is in instilling confidence in students.\" This is Norman's first week at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig and she has yet to tour the high school building that has been recognized for poor conditions. \"It's definitely a priority, students need a safe environment to learn in,\" Norman said. Walker said the \"Bug School\" is on the Bureau of Indian Education's list for reconstruction money during the board meeting. In addition to staffing, the board approved the appointments of officers for the next year. Rocky Papasodora will remain chairman, Anita Cloud accepted the position of vice chairwoman, Kathy Fairbanks will be secretary and Brenda White was appointed treasurer. During executive session the board heard from the Local Indian Education Committee. The LIEC oversees the operation of the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig school and serves in an advisory capacity to the Leech Lake Reservation Tribal Council.Committee chairman Benjamin Meat said he cannot comment on the topic of discussion. The LIEC presented the board with bylaws during the regular session.",

    "DiffbotBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway. Separately, P\u0026G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P\u0026G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P\u0026G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P\u0026G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter \u0026 Gamble shareholders could exchange P\u0026G shares for shares of Coty. P\u0026G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P\u0026G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P\u0026G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P\u0026G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P\u0026G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P\u0026G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. “This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,” Lafley said. “We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.” Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P\u0026G’s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal “is a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,” said Ali Dibadj, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. “The timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,” Dibadj told me. “Feels a little amateurish in terms of process by P\u0026G.” The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger, an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. “Sales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P\u0026G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,” Strebinger told me. The brands that P\u0026G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P\u0026G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P\u0026G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head \u0026 Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. “Procter \u0026 Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we’d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,” Erin Lash, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. “However, we don’t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.” The beauty category “has remained a challenge for P\u0026G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,” Lash wrote. “We suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.” The other brands included in P\u0026G’s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice \u0026 Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. acted as financial adviser on the transaction, and Cadwalader, Wickersham \u0026 Taft LLP acted as tax counsel. Jones Day acted as legal counsel, and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P\u0026G.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Gay rights don't just matter to homosexuals, says one of UBS' top economists - they lead to direct economic benefits for society at large. Photo: Bloomberg A top economist at UBS says denying same-sex marriage rights erodes an economy's competitiveness and holds back labour force mobility at the expense of much-needed productivity. London-based economist Paul Donovan analysed the outcome of the US Supreme Court decision in new research published by the global investment bank. He dismissed the impulse to attribute a figure to the economic value of wedding spend for same-sex marriages, arguing this was only a one-off benefit and ignored enduring contributions to trend growth from labour force productivity. The economist also measured the relationship between homophobic attitudes and economic competitiveness and found populations with intolerant attitudes correlate closely with inferior competitiveness scores. \"Irrationally discriminating against a section of society will deny an economy the full value of that group's skill set,\" he argued. Mr Donovan explained that denying individuals their marital rights distorts the efficient allocation of labour guided by the US example where states differed in their recognition. High labour mobility was associated with the strongest-performing US states and areas within the European Union. More difficult to quantify is the impact on societal status. Mr Donovan started by addressing the existence of an economic distortion where inconsistent rights are enforced. \"It does not matter what the discriminating characteristic is – gender, religion, race, class, sexuality etc,\" he said. \"If one group in society is privileged relative to another, and there is no possibility of moving between those two groups, then the group denied the privilege will be economically disadvantaged and the economy as a whole will become less efficient [less productive].\" This, he argued, means that even if lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals have full legal rights within a same-sex union, without the ability to enter into marriage, the issue of status inferiority remains unresolved and the full potential of human capital is \"wasted\". \"If the word marriage has any value in society, then to deny one group the right to use the term is to send a signal that membership of that group denotes an inferior status in society. Obviously if one group is perceived as inferior, whether that perception is overt or covert, this tendency will be economically wasteful,\" the economist argued. He aligned global competitiveness scores measured by the World Economic Forum with published attitudes to the LGBT community and found that the most tolerant and non-discriminatory economies were the most competitive. \"Raising productivity for 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the population will have an impact on trend economic growth … Investors looking for economies with a competitive edge should take note.\" The national broadcaster has announced the closure of 50 ABC Shops across the country. Its online shop and retail kiosks will remain, but the bricks and mortar stores are no longer covering their costs and will be phased out. Meanwhile, grandparents and parents around the country have greeted the news with simultaneous relief that they will never again receive a pair of Dr Who Ugg boots for Christmas or Father's Day, and terror at the potential wait for the ABC's online shop to deliver a replacement Peppa Pig or Wiggles toy. Have declining CD and DVD sales contributed to the ABC shutting its retail stores across Australia? Photo: Darrian Traynor So what is behind the closure? Managing director Mark Scott claimed on Thursday morning it was declining CD and DVD sales, saying customers were now buying this content online. (Errr, the ABC's iView is also putting whole series online so we don't actually have to buy it.) Mr Scott added the shops had been operating at a loss for the past year. \"[It] would not be possible for us to run a chain of stores like this into the future,\" he told ABC's breakfast program. But it seems odd that ABC Shops would survive for 35 years - years that included introduction of online shopping, the global financial crisis, the strong Australian dollar and the soft retail economy - then close just as retail trade figures pick up. However, when you look at the statistics on CD and DVD sales, the trend is clear. Sales of music CDs in Australia have declined 72 per cent since 2005, a year when ABC Commercial pumped $15 million back into the broadcaster (which received $808 million in government funding that year). CD sales dropped from 46 million CDs in 2005 to 12.5 million last year, according to the Australian Recording Industry Association. Even in 2012, about 27 million CDs were sold here, so the decline in the past three years has been particularly steep. The 2015 figures must be worse. Meanwhile digital album sales have increased from 91,000 in 2005 to 7.3 million albums in 2013. The number of music DVDs sold every year has dropped 83 per cent since 2005, from 4.4 million to 757,000 DVDs in 2014. Sales of entertainment DVDs, such as movies and television shows, have dropped from a peak of about 90 million DVDs in 2008 to around 55 million in 2014, according to the Australian Home Entertainment Distributors Association. Who knows what will happen to DVD sales with the introduction of several new streaming services this year, such as Netflix and Stan. ABC Shops are managed by ABC Commercial, a branch of the broadcaster that also manages live appearances by ABC celebrities, produces and sells CDs, DVDs, books and audio books, produces eight magazines, sells ABC programs overseas and licences ABC footage to other broadcasters. In recent years, ABC Commercial has not been contributing as much back to the mother-ship as it used to. It delivered just $1.4 million in the 2013-14 financial year, down from a peak of $19 million in 2005-06. These figures include all the activities of the commercial division, including selling programs overseas. (You would be surprised at how popular Dance Academy is South Korea.) In the 1990s the ABC's commercial arm operated 26 shops and 96 kiosks inside other retailers. It was contributing about $8 million a year to the broadcaster with the retail shops contributing about half of that figure, according to annual reports. It no longer reveals how much of ABC Commercial's revenue comes from retail shops. Head of ABC Commercial Robert Patterson said this morning the closure was \"in keeping with the shift of ABC audiences to accessing content across an array of digital platforms, while maintaining an appropriate level of physical retail distribution\". The shops won't disappear overnight, but will have a \"phased exit\" from stand-alone stores in shopping malls as leases come up for negotiation. Some might still be around at Christmas, so you are still not safe from receiving Macca's latest Australia All Over CD.",

Theriault celebrated Independence Day at a cookout in Framingham on Saturday, enjoying good food and good company. When the skies cleared in the afternoon, Theriault left to escort his friend, Brian Brush, back home to Shrewsbury. Brush had recently moved into a new apartment and Theriault wanted to see it in person, relishing an opportunity to get his motorcycle back on the road, McGavin said. “Anytime he could ride, he would ride,” she said. Theriault revved up his 2004 Yamaha motorcycle and headed west, enjoying the sunshine, the breeze and the camaraderie of a midsummer bike ride with his buddies. Seated behind him, his partner, Victoria Tucker, wrapped her arms around his waist, resting her head on his right shoulder. McGavin, 22, of Littleton, said it was an image she will long remember. “He rode with a smile the entire time,” said McGavin, who was traveling close by as a passenger on another motorcycle. After stopping by Shrewsbury, Theriault and Tucker were heading back east on Rte. 9 around 6:20 p.m. on Saturday when their motorcycle collided with the back of a 2010 Toyota Corolla near the Shrewsbury Commons apartments. The bike tumbled, then skidded off the side of the roadway. Tucker, a 22-year-old art student from Woburn, died at the scene, according to Shrewsbury police. Theriault was taken to UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, where he was pronounced dead. Police are still investigating the crash. No charges had been filed. The driver of the Corolla, Libo Chen, 28, of Shrewsbury, was not injured. For those who knew Theriault, his death was a startling blow. He was remembered this week as an outgoing and loyal friend who put those he met at ease. McGavin said he was comfortable chatting with friends who shared his passions and strangers alike. “(He was) the most kind-hearted, biggest-hearted person you would ever meet,” she said. “He could hold a conversation with literally anybody about anything.” Theriault grew up in Lincoln and attended Austin Preparatory School in Reading, where he enjoyed competing in paintball matches and playing hockey, McGavin said. He studied at Saint Anselm College, but did not finish his degree. He later settled in Framingham and transferred to Framingham State University. Friends said he was expected to graduate in December and took pride in his decision to further his education. “It’s been kind of like a triumph,” McGavin said. Outside of the classroom, Theriault formed fast friendships with those who shared his hobbies. He participated in a competitive paintball league, playing for a team called the Boston Ducks.

Paul Dryden, one of the team’s assistant captains, said Theriault – who went by the nickname “Twitch” – was always the first person on the field for practice and the last one off at the end of the day. “Darius was a driving force behind our team as well as the New England paintball community,” Dryden wrote. “Over the years, he played for countless teams in the region, and was universally known as a talented player with a huge heart and desire to grow the sport.” The Boston Ducks will permanently retire his player number, 28, and his teammates will wear the number on a patch in his memory. The team also hopes to donate the proceeds of a charity paintball event to his family, according to Dryden. Like Theriault, Tucker – known to her friends as “Torri” – was also reaching the end of her college career. McGavin said she was an aspiring tattoo artist who could often be found practicing her craft. “She would sketch for days,” she recalled. “She would draw anything she could.” McGavin said Theriault planned to propose to his girlfriend within the next several weeks. After witnessing Saturday’s crash, McGavin said she rushed to help the couple as they lay injured on the side of the road. When it became clear Tucker did not survive, McGavin said she tried to comfort Theriault with the memory of his girlfriend. “I just kept holding his hand and telling him, ‘It’s all right. Go to her,' ” she said. After the crash, friends erected a small memorial along the side of Rte. 9, anchored by an American flag. Brush said he was stunned by his friend’s death, particularly because Theriault made safety a priority. Brush said he will remember his friend for his easygoing demeanor and engaging personality. “You won't meet another person like that,” he said.

    "DiffbotBody": "You've heard it all your life: Being humble, kind, and calm is the \"right thing to do.\" But if that isn't enough to convince you, consider this: humility, kindness, and calmness can actually help you get ahead in life. The Benefits of Being Humble Confidence is key to getting ahead in life. It helps you do better at work, in relationships, and in interviews. Overconfidence, however, can make you seem like a genuine jerk. We all know that one person that thinks they are the strongest, smartest, and just all around best at everything. Truthfully, we all dislike that person to some degree. So, while confidence is essential, it's important to stay humble as well (the two aren't as contradictory as you might think). Remember the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes: It's okay to be wrong about something and, more importantly, it's okay to admit that to others. This shows that you not only value your opinion and decisions, but that you also value the opinions and decisions of those around you. People respond well to humility because it shows that you place yourself at the same level as them, and not above them. Plus, it has other benefits too. Psyblog has an eye-opening list of these benefits that can occur in your personal and professional life. Here are just a few: Soothe the Soul: Humble people are better able to cope with anxiety about their mortality. Instead of erecting self-defenses against death, humble people tend to find it provides a useful perspective on life and how it should be lived. When it's not all about you, it makes death easier to contemplate. Higher Self-Control: Having high self-control is one key to a successful life. Oddly, perhaps, studies have found that an obsession with the self can paradoxically lead to lower self-control. The humble, though, because they place less importance on the self, exhibit higher self-control in many situations. Perhaps this is partly due to the fact that humble people tend to know their limits. More Helpful: Humble people are, on average, more helpful than people who are conceited or egotistical. In a study by LaBouff et al. (2011), participants who were more humble, were more likely to offer help, and offered more of their time, to those in need. Unsurprisingly, humble people have also been found to be more generous. The full post lists even more benefits, and is worth a look. That last one, \"More Helpful,\" can be especially useful to you. To get where we want to go, we often need help—and what better way to get that help than from those we've helped already? In addition, studies show that being humble generally leads to better work performance. So even if you're a little overconfident on the inside, practicing humility can actually get you ahead. Kill Them With Kindness Everyone knows the Golden Rule, but not everyone takes it to heart. Kindness often gets overlooked as a sign of weakness, and to an extent, it can be—there is such a thing as being too nice. But a little kindness can still go a long way. For starters, being kind is good for you. As in, it's actually healthy for you in the biological sense. A recent study found that there may be some connection with positive thoughts of kindness and social contact with the body's vagus nerve: The vagus regulates how efficiently heart rate changes with breathing and, in general, the greater its tone, the higher the heart-rate variability and the lower the risk for cardiovascular disease and other major killers. It may also play a role in regulating glucose levels and immune responses (...) the vagus is intimately tied to how we connect with one another—it links directly to nerves that tune our ears to human speech, coordinate eye contact and regulate emotional expressions. Being kind can also make you happier. It feels good to be nice and help others and it can physically make you feel happier. There is a chemical reason for that: When a person performs an act of kindness the brain produces dopamine, associated with positive thinking. Secondly, the brain has its own natural versions of morphine and heroine: endogenous opioids, such as endorphins. It is believed that when a person does an act of kindness they feel good on a chemical level thanks to the production of these endogenous opioids. Not only that, but if you exhibit kindness, others will like you more (shocker!). According to Adam Grant, the youngest-tenured and highest-rated professor at Wharton, giving is the secret to getting ahead. Grant credits his success to being kind and helping others when they need it. So being nice doesn't just help others—it can help you, too. Please Remain Calm Remaining calm in tough situations is a bigger challenge, but equally as important. Stress, deadlines, and surprises can get to us mentally and emotionally. Even the strongest of people can succumb to the almighty power of unpredictability. Figuring out how to stay calm will, for obvious reasons, make your life a lot more enjoyable. Stress is a killer, we know this. It's been linked to heart problems, depression, and even PTSD. So how do we manage it? Pick the Brain has some great tips that can make the toughest situations far more manageable. For example: Detach yourself: If you can physically move away from the situation or the place that will be the best, but you can also mentally detach yourself from what's going on. Reach out: No matter how much of a self-dependent person you are, at the end of the day you should always have a group of friends and family you can go back to with your problems. You will be surprised how therapeutic just talking it out feels. Cry if you want to: Irrespective of your sex, if you want to cry, just let it out. Crying helps to release that bottled-up feeling and clears the mind as well. The full post has even more tips, and is worth a read. Staying calm will make you more likeable and make others think that you are more in control than you actually are. You can't control everything that happens to you, but you can control how you handle situations in a way that will have people gravitate toward you. It might seem obvious that humility, kindness, and calmness are positive traits. But in case you ever needed more of a reason to exhibit these things, they don't just help others—they help you and make your life easier. So extend your hand in kindness and offer help to those who need it. They just might extend their hand back to help you get where you want to go. Admit you're wrong when you are and find a way to believe that other people might be better than you at something. They just might offer you advice or teach you how to get better at a particular skill. And, no matter what happens, always try and remain calm and keep from going off the deep end. Everyone you've ever met is trying to do the exact same thing you are. Life is a lot easier when you accept that you aren't the only one living it. Title image remixed from halimqd (Shutterstock).",

Secondly, the brain has its own natural versions of morphine and heroine: endogenous opioids, such as endorphins. It is believed that when a person does an act of kindness they feel good on a chemical level thanks to the production of these endogenous opioids. Not only that, but if you exhibit kindness, others will like you more (shocker!). According to Adam Grant, the youngest-tenured and highest-rated professor at Wharton, giving is the secret to getting ahead. Grant credits his success to being kind and helping others when they need it. So being nice doesn't just help others—it can help you, too. Please Remain Calm. Remaining calm in tough situations is a bigger challenge, but equally as important. Stress, deadlines, and surprises can get to us mentally and emotionally. Even the strongest of people can succumb to the almighty power of unpredictability. Figuring out how to stay calm will, for obvious reasons, make your life a lot more enjoyable. Stress is a killer, we know this. It's been linked to heart problems, depression, and even PTSD. So how do we manage it? Pick the Brain has some great tips that can make the toughest situations far more manageable. For example: The full post has even more tips, and is worth a read. Staying calm will make you more likeable and make others think that you are more in control than you actually are. You can't control everything that happens to you, but you can control how you handle situations in a way that will have people gravitate toward you. It might seem obvious that humility, kindness, and calmness are positive traits. But in case you ever needed more of a reason to exhibit these things, they don't just help others—they help you and make your life easier. So extend your hand in kindness and offer help to those who need it. They just might extend their hand back to help you get where you want to go. Admit you're wrong when you are and find a way to believe that other people might be better than you at something. They just might offer you advice or teach you how to get better at a particular skill. And, no matter what happens, always try and remain calm and keep from going off the deep end. Everyone you've ever met is trying to do the exact same thing you are. Life is a lot easier when you accept that you aren't the only one living it.",

Read More [Editor’s Note: Be sure to join IGN and Harmonix for the world gameplay premiere of Rock Band 4 in our live stream on Friday, May 15 at 12pm PT/3pm ET/7pm GMT. That's 5am AEST on Saturday.] Many would agree that Rock Band 2 was the peak of Rock Band’s campaign design. Rock Band 4 aims to outperform the 2008 game’s limited story elements and band interaction with a simple, strong new feature: Gigs. “A gig is a new structure that we’ve put into Rock Band 4 to sort of capture the feeling of a live performance,” Lead Designer Chris Foster told IGN. It’s also an incredible way to have an extra layer of fun, or cause tension with, the people you’re playing with. Here’s hoping Rock Band 4 doesn’t cause any band breakups. You'll 'as a band' be able to vote on a setlist. Foster explained that the act of performing live music isn’t represented completely accurately in previous Rock Band games. You don’t hop on stage, play a song, and leave. “It’s sort of the ebb and flow of the arc of a performance over successive songs. So, like, the crowd coming with you, or potentially you needing to win them over…it’s a sense of momentum and pacing. So what we wanted to do with this is capture the sense of a gig and use it for narrative means, for new gameplay and emotional experiences within the Rock Band framework.” Essentially, Gigs operate similar to older games’ Setlists, or Rock Band 3’s Challenges. “It’s a series of songs subdivided into a series of sets with set breaks,” said Foster. A Gig we played involved four songs in two sets of two. A set break between each duo had stuff we’ve never seen in Rock Band before. “If you’re the vocalist, you’re able to perform a sort of stage patter…it’s sort of like adding some LARPing to your Rock Band experience,” Foster said. “You’re sort of role-playing a different event that is sort of happening offstage, or got you to the show in the first place inside the campaign, we’re using them to deliver the narrative experience.” So what does that mean, gameplay-wise? “They need to be really fun to play,” Foster said. “Particularly as the crowd is reacting. So, you’ll do your crowd work as a vocalist, the band will play a couple of songs, and then you’ll take another break. And in those breaks, you’ll be able to do a lot of voting. In some cases, there’ll be a set list that is predefined, like in previous Rock Bands. But in other cases, you’ll – as a band – be able to vote on a setlist.” Choices appear between sets, drawn from your music library and the gig’s theme/genre. Bandmates have a limited time to choose the song they all wish to play -- which could lead to interesting, awkward interactions with you band. Your guitarist may decide on a spectacular, fun song the vocalist doesn’t know, or can’t sing to properly. An exhausted drummer can vote for something laid-back, while the rest of his bandmates troll her with a gnarly drum solo track. “It becomes a really interesting collaborative and competitive experience, as you’ll have people say what they want and what they absolutely don’t want,” Foster said. “It’s fun, because when you’re beat-matching, it’s tunnel vision; you’re focused on your instrument, you’re barely aware of other people if they’re falling out or if you can save them. But the moments between songs, we’re able to come up with these other game experiences, and they can be really fun.” Fighting or messing with your band isn’t necessarily to your advantage of course. You can carry over your multipliers and Overdrive power between songs during gigs, adding a small but interesting extra layer of strategy that can affect your band’s score. Gigs can be played for kicks in a party setting, for sure, but they’re also core to Rock Band 4’s campaign -- which involves an interesting branching narrative similar to an RPG. We’ll have more on that for you later this month.

Photo: Cameron Spencer Daly Cherry-Evans can take the first step in justifying his $10 million price tag when he faces the club he reneged on at Cbus Stadium. For the first time since his contract saga was resolved definitively, Cherry-Evans will take on the Gold Coast on Monday night. The Manly halfback signed a \"lifetime\" contract to remain on the northern beaches, although inking the biggest contract in rugby league history didn't stop him from being axed by the Maroons. Fox Sports is hoping the fixture will be a ratings winner given the firestorm over the 26-year-old's decision to take advantage of the contentious round-13 clause, which has subsequently been scrapped. However, the Monday night timeslot will likely result in a modest crowd, although it could well be a vocal one given the reception \"DCE\" received in Brisbane following his announcement. The Titans have decided not to stir up anti-DCE sentiment in the build up, missing an opportunity to market and promote the clash. However, the league fraternity will watch with interest to see if Titans players look for retribution - and how Cherry-Evans handles the occasion. \"I don't really know, to be honest,\" Gold Coast CEO Graham Annesley said when asked about the likely crowd reaction. \"I can only gauge it from when Manly played Brisbane a few weeks ago. There was some lighthearted crowd involvement and there may well be some more of that, but nothing we're motivating as a club. \"If it motivates people to come to the game, then I will be very happy about that. As long as they behave themselves and do the right thing they can see him play and see how we go against him. That's great for us, we'll gladly accept them.\" Cherry-Evans bought a $1.45 million property in Mermaid Waters in what many believed was a pointer he would honour his commitment to the Titans. While he changed his mind, the Redcliffe product wasn't able to backflip on the four-bedroom house, which settled just days before confirming his Sea Eagles deal. However, he won't be able to stay in it over the weekend, as the tenants are committed for the foreseeable future. The Titans have yet to find a replacement for Cherry-Evans, missing out on Trent Hodkinson and a number of other key targets. They are pursuing boom Brisbane No.7 Ashley Taylor but they could again be thwarted by the Sea Eagles, who are tabling an offer of their own. Out-of-favour Newcastle halfback Tyrone Roberts could be a fallback option for a club still recovering from the DCE debacle. Asked if there was still animosity towards Cherry-Evans, a diplomatic Annesley said: \"Not any longer. Obviously it was disappointing at the time when it happened but we have moved on very quickly. [Coach] Neil Henry was looking at his other options that very same afternoon. \"Coaches don't sit around dwelling on these things, nor do I or the board. It's happened, we need to prepare our roster for next season and try to compete well for the remainder of this season. \"We haven't sat around crying in our Weet-Bix about it.\" The former NSW Minister for Sport said the club would not rush into finding a replacement playmaker to partner Kane Elgey. \"There are a number of options explored already,\" he said. \"I'm not suggesting we've made offers on others at this stage but we won't rush into it. We want to get the right person at the right fit for our club going forward. If that takes a bit more time, so be it.\" Manly utility forward Ligi Sao will return to his hometown and rejoin the Warriors for the next two NRL seasons. Sao, 23, moved to Manly in 2013 and has made 16 first-grade appearances for the Sea Eagles, 15 of them this season. Warriors coach Andrew McFadden says Sao will add depth to the club and increase competition for spots. Sao, who played for the Junior Warriors, including in their 2001 grand final win, said returning to Auckland was a key factor in his decision. He will get an early introduction to his future teammates when he runs out at lock against the Warriors at Mt Smart Stadium on Saturday. Sao had been in danger of missing the match after being charged with a dangerous throw on North Queensland's Michael Morgan. But at the NRL judiciary on Wednesday night, he was found not guilty over the incident in the Sea Eagles' 30-12 loss to the Cowboys on Monday night. The Warriors have already signed Roosters star fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Rabbitohs hooker Issac Luke. Sao's move to the Warriors came as reports emerged of the club's desire to sack players en masse, with up to 14 Sea Eagles said to be in the firing line. Manly coach Geoff Toovey says he knows nothing of the rumours. AAP",

    "DiffbotBody": "BEMIDJI—After the website Vevo leaked Saphire Brown's \"Fearless\" music video a few weeks back, word finally spread enough to force her to officially release it Wednesday, two days ahead of schedule. Advertisement Despite the leak, the Bemidji-area country music singer said she saw an even greater reaction after she went to social media to announce the video's release. \"I woke up (Thursday) and there was over 4,000 views, and I was shocked,\" she said. \"I was almost in tears because it was so amazing.\" The song \"Fearless\" is about Gracie Woods, a high school student in Thief River Falls who was diagnosed with cancer four years ago, Brown said. She met Woods last September, and the two ended up joining forces, Brown performing and each of them speaking at high schools across northern Minnesota for Saphire's Courage Campaign. Brown created the campaign several years ago after experiencing bullying in multiple schools when she was younger. Brown said she came up with the idea for the song on a hunting trip with Woods. She said Woods did fearless things such as touching an electric fence and nearly getting knocked down by the kick of the gun. The next day, Brown said she wrote \"Fearless.\" The process is a little backward, according to Brown, since she hasn't released her extended play recording (EP), titled \"Courage,\" or full album before releasing a music video. \"I didn't feel like I had time to do that, and it didn't feel right to me because all of us don't know how much time Gracie has left,\" she said. Woods joined Brown in a professional photo shoot by Kevin White and the shooting of the \"Fearless\" video, produced by Bemidji High School graduate Harlan Hegna. \"It's over and beyond what I expected,\" Brown said about the video. \"...Harlan, he saw my vision in my head of this crazy 'Let's do this music video in less than 30 days,' and he just made everything happen.\" Moving forward, Brown said the pace is only going to quicken. \"I guess my next step is to release my EP,\" Brown said. \"And then after that my goal is to hit 20 schools from September to January before I leave for Nashville.\" Even though specific plans are in question, Brown described Nashville as \"a big ball of opportunity,\" and she said she can't wait to get there. Brown's next performance is at 4 p.m. Saturday at the Beltrami County Relay for Life event in Bemidji. To see the video and for more about Brown, visit www.saphirebrownofficial.com.",

    "LabBody": "Vivek MV, Bengaluru, July 11, 2015, DHNS: New Zealand look to bounce back. After clinching the five-match ODI series 3-2, a confident-looking Indian women’s team will take on New Zealand in the first of the three T20 Internationals here at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.The hosts have the momentum on their side after scripting a great comeback when the chips were down in the one-dayers. In their previous T20I outing in Bengaluru, India had snatched a 16-run victory against South Africa in November last year. Indian spinners, barring one bad game, succeeded to trouble the New Zealand batting with some tight and economical bowling performance. In the pace department, Jhulan Goswami, the women’s No 1 ranked bowler in the world, has done well so far by not being expensive early on in the innings.However, Indian batters will face a challenging task to score at a brisk pace against a competitive New Zealand bowling attack. The hosts will bank on the dashing left-handed opener Smriti Mandhana and skipper Mithali Raj to come good for them with their explosive batting.In their biggest assignment last year, the 2014 Women’s World T20 held in Bangladesh, India had crashed out in the group stage, with two wins and two defeats. The White Ferns boast of some big hitters in their line-up and skipper Suzie Bates felt that her side must dismiss their tentative approach that hurt them badly in the ODIs. “I think we have a very strong T20 side. All-rounders such as Sophie Devine and Anna Peterson can clear the boundaries with ease. But I am a bit disappointed with how the batswomen have played the Indian spinners. We were very tentative in our approach and things didn’t work for us. It is all about backing ourselves,” said Bates. Bates stressed that this T20I series is an important step towards their preparation for the Women’s World T20, scheduled in India next year. “The series is massive for us. We want to get more familiar with the conditions since we know we will play the World T20 in India next year. The team is looking forward to putting up an improved show,” she said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "At the end of June, the Greek government instituted capital controls — limits on how much money can be drawn from banks — after negotiations with the eurozone broke down and the country's fiscal and monetary lifelines disappeared. Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview.

Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.'

    "DiffbotBody": "Adding meal or snack entries was a cinch, with more than 5 million listed food items from the crowdsourced global database. Oddly there's no auto conversion from ounces to grams for entries from the US, but there's usually enough in metric measure to get by. Even a particularly uncommon restaurant creation will have some near-enough substitute entry, though I'm sure Anna Polyviou would weep knowing I reduced a slice of her award-winning, 35-step, MasterChef-featured carrot cake masterpiece to \"Carrot cake – Walmart Bakery\". Accomplishments celebrated Like activity tracker apps, MyFitnessPal acts like a tiny personal trainer by regularly celebrating healthy bites and nudging when you trip up. Each night, a simple MyFitnessPal screen informs you: \"If every day was like today ... you'd weigh xx kg in five weeks.\" which is hard to ignore. For individual food entries, a little coloured bubble rewarded my steak with \"This food is high in protein!\", while a \"Double whopper, no cheese, 3766 kJ\" got me \"Your fat goal for today is 72 grams, and this has 56 grams\". The bubbles don't always pop up, and MyFitnessPal's general philosophy seems to be that over nagging can be counterproductive, especially for those already a little sensitive. The developers must be either great managers or parents. If you're after a stricter digital dietitian, Jawbone's Up app is arguably the most vocal and judgmental, ruthlessly scoring each of your meals out of 10 for nutritional value. You don't need an actual Jawbone device and even better, it syncs with MyFitnessPal and its much bigger food database. Such handy app partnerships are bountiful with MyFitnessPal, including for activity trackers. Exercise makes a difference to weight control and in MyFitnessPal earns you more calories to \"spend\" that day. While you can quickly enter workouts manually, Fitbit steps automatically flowed through to give me more reliable kilojoule kudos, as did Endomondo and Strava bike rides, and even Pilates workouts with the Wahoo Fitness app and heart rate chest strap (using Apple's native Health app as a \"bridge\").

The MyFitnessPal calorie counter app uses a mix of friendly nagging and hard targets to fix problems activity trackers can't, writes Ky Chow. Many of us have a general idea that our toil at the gym burns a depressingly low amount of calories, but without those facts constantly in our face and delicious food to be had, we rely on boot camps and spin sessions to shed our excess kilos and inches. The MyFitnessPal app (iOS, Android, Windows and a very slow Blackberry version) is a well thought out, enormously popular calorie counter that blows this fantasy away with brutally specific numbers throughout your day. Without changing my exercise regime, I dropped eight kilos after just a few months. Simple to use. It's simple to set up: enter your current and target weights, and how quickly you want to get there. The app then gives you a daily calorie (or kilojoule) limit that it expects will make you hit that target weight. The accountability of constant hard numbers on my mobile device changed my eating habits surprisingly quickly, and it probably suits competitive corporate types. To stay below my 6700kJ daily limit, I found myself bypassing my once-automatic mid-afternoon \"Time Out (Cadbury), 32g, 732kJ\". If I enjoyed \"Eggs Benedict with Ham – Coffee Club, 3908 kJ\" for Saturday brunch, I'd pass on entrees at dinner (well, most of the time). Adding meal or snack entries was a cinch, with more than 5 million listed food items from the crowdsourced global database. Oddly there's no auto conversion from ounces to grams for entries from the US, but there's usually enough in metric measure to get by. Even a particularly uncommon restaurant creation will have some near-enough substitute entry, though I'm sure Anna Polyviou would weep knowing I reduced a slice of her award-winning, 35-step, MasterChef-featured carrot cake masterpiece to \"Carrot cake – Walmart Bakery\". Accomplishments celebrated. Like activity tracker apps, MyFitnessPal acts like a tiny personal trainer by regularly celebrating healthy bites and nudging when you trip up. Each night, a simple MyFitnessPal screen informs you: \"If every day was like today ... you'd weigh xx kg in five weeks.\" which is hard to ignore. For individual food entries, a little coloured bubble rewarded my steak with \"This food is high in protein!\", while a \"Double whopper, no cheese, 3766 kJ\" got me \"Your fat goal for today is 72 grams, and this has 56 grams\". The bubbles don't always pop up, and MyFitnessPal's general philosophy seems to be that over nagging can be counterproductive, especially for those already a little sensitive. The developers must be either great managers or parents. If you're after a stricter digital dietitian, Jawbone's Up app is arguably the most vocal and judgmental, ruthlessly scoring each of your meals out of 10 for nutritional value. You don't need an actual Jawbone device and even better, it syncs with MyFitnessPal and its much bigger food database. Such handy app partnerships are bountiful with MyFitnessPal, including for activity trackers. Exercise makes a difference to weight control and in MyFitnessPal earns you more calories to \"spend\" that day. While you can quickly enter workouts manually, Fitbit steps automatically flowed through to give me more reliable kilojoule kudos, as did Endomondo and Strava bike rides, and even Pilates workouts with the Wahoo Fitness app and heart rate chest strap (using Apple's native Health app as a \"bridge\"). A 300 metre test walk in Strava didn't sync. MyFitnessPal might be too tactful to say why, but I bet it was because it was such a wimpy workout.

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment Last year, North Easton residents thought they’d be browsing the menu at a hot new dining spot by now. Instead, they were staring at a huge “for sale” sign outside the 114 Main St. property. Developer David Howe slapped the sign on the fence in front of the vacant lot – and the site of his future 200- to 300-seat eatery - on June 25, the day after the Zoning Board of Appeals rescinded its May 19 variance of onsite parking requirements and left his project in permitting limbo. The stalemate between local officials and Howe over what was described as a procedural “conundrum” showed no sign of letting up this week. On Monday, Howe’s attorneys told selectmen they had filed an Open Meeting Law complaint with the Attorney General’s office. They claim the ZBA violated the law on June 24 by meeting without the required “super majority” of four voting members present, withdrew its May 19 approval of the variances and then tried to illegally approve ones with news conditions on parking. “If you need a supermajority to get the variance, you need a supermajority to change the variance,” Doug Troyer said. “My client is now in a position where he has to vigorously defend this.” Troyer also questions the legality of the posted agenda, which stated the board was to discuss, not reconsider, the issue of 114 Main St. He wants to know what occurred after the May 19 vote and why the six variances approved - including a waiver of onsite parking requirements - were not written up and submitted to the town clerk for final adoption before June 24 - just two days shy of the deadline for action. Town Counsel Jay Talerman disagreed, saying the board could call meetings and “flip-flop every day until they actually file the decision.” He said ZBA Vice-chairman Thomas Pursley called the June 24 session because he thought the parking issue was important enough to have the board reconsider the May variances “out of an abundance of caution.” Pursley had cast the lone dissenting vote on May 19, citing a bylaw requirement for 83 parking spots. He said Howe’s lease with developer Doug King for 100 valet spots, his access to municipal and on street parking might not be sufficient to protect a congested, downtown area, especially if the lease were not renewed. “He has “zero” onsite parking spots,” Pursley said. “You can’t have a restaurant that seats 300 people and have nowhere to park their cars.” He failed to convince his colleagues to condition the variance subject to a six-month review. But on June 24, and with only three voting members present - Pursley, Michael Spillane and Ryan Cook - the board voted to rescind the May 19 vote and pass a new variance with parking conditions requiring Howe to come back with a new plan within six months if he lost King’s lot. » Comment or view comments",

Howe refused and only the rescinded variance remains in effect. Talerman said he “certainly alerted the chairman as to the conundrum” he faced. “The board was left with an awkward situation. They felt it was important enough to move forward.” Meanwhile, angry residents accused local government officials of playing “tug-of-war” with North Easton Village over a restaurant everyone wants. Patty Locke of 161 Norton Ave. urged selectmen to get second opinion from another legal counsel. “I was frankly embarrassed for the town by the way Mr. Howe was treated. It just doesn’t seem legal to me,” she said Monday night. “I’m just incensed about it.” Town Administrator David Colton said the town had put years of effort into revitalizing North Easton Village and paving the way for Howe to redevelop the 114 Main St. site. “We’ve all been rowing in the same direction,” Colton said. He said zoning board members “did their job to the best of their ability.” Talerman said the gulf between the two parties remained “fairly large.” On June 6, Howe’s attorney Andrew Daniels requested records of all documents, emails and text messages sent between zoning board members and between the ZBA and Colton since May 20. The request was sent to Colton, Pursley and Town Clerk Jeremy Gillis. Colton said he was complying with the request that encompasses an “extremely broad” amount of information. He noted that anything relating to attorney-client privilege could be exempt. The state allows public officials to withhold some closed session minutes, after the courts ruled that confidential communications between government boards and their attorneys were entitled to the same attorney-client protections as those of individuals. Troyer later said the ZBA could simply drop its June 24 action and return to the May 19 vote. The fact that the June 24 decision was immediately filed with the town clerk the following day complicated the issue, he said. Talerman said Howe could reapply for the variances and proceed with his project. But Howe, who was awarded the bid by the town to redevelop the property into a restaurant, said “the action by the Board of Appeals, purportedly denying the variance, after I purchased the property from the town for the specific purpose of constructing and operating a restaurant on the site, is simply not in the best interest of the revitalization of the Village. “Without the variance, I have little option but to attempt to repurpose the site for something other than a restaurant, such as a parking lot, or sell the property,” he said. The parking problems may all be addressed by the time Howe would have been ready to open his new restaurant next year. In May, Town Meeting adopted new bylaws that could reduce parking requirements for businesses by special permit. The action is awaiting ratification from the state’s Attorney General’s office. Local officials understand that parking regulations may work for some commercial districts in town but not for areas like North Easton Village, Colton said. The town is also hoping to acquire more public parking space behind Main Street and looking into sharing parking areas. Colton said other businesses in the village did not require parking variances because they do not generate much traffic or had limited onsite parking in the rear. The popular Farmer’s Daughter next door enjoys grandfathered rights because the premises had previously operated as a restaurant and it did not expand its occupancy permit.",

First, though, the riders must tackle the Glandon again – going up in the opposite direction this time – before carrying on over the Col de la Croix de Fer.

There probably won’t be much to split the favourites over the Croix de Fer, which weighs in at a sapping 29km, but there should be one last scrap between the yellow jersey hopefuls on the hairpins of the climb to Alpe d’Huez. Whoever leads the race at the top will win overall. Winner: Yellow Jersey: Points Leader: Mountains Classification: Stage 21: Sunday, July 26 – Sevres to Paris – 109.5km The race ends with the traditional – and largely processional – sprint stage into Paris, finishing on the Champs-Elysees.

Attention is what all marketers are looking for. And it’s damn hard to find, and hold on to. When people consume “their” news brand, that’s all they’re doing. They aren’t checking their phone or driving to work. Reading the news is one of the few things that we still literally sit down and really take our time for.

It was a weekend to give the lakes to the pleasure boaters and jet skiers. Advertisement With a lot of walleye anglers from the area going to Leech Lake, that kind of shows how the bite has been around Brainerd. Which brings me back to my quest to find out what's up with Gull Lake. I hear the tourism in the area is above average, which we can tell by how busy town is. But after days of fishing and no fish, are they coming back? Then I hear fish numbers are average for Gull Lake. Then another thought I have been hearing is that stocked fish stay in the weeds because they grow up in weeds and it is familiar to them. But Gull is mainly stocked with fry, which do not grow up in weeds. Myself and most other anglers remember when you could always go out and catch a few fish during the day, but now those days are few and far between. You can still catch fish during the primetime hours and after dark. So I guess its time to get the headlamp on and go fishin'.",

Salazar (8-4), who came within one out of his second career complete game, struck out eight. The right-hander retired the first two hitters in the ninth before Ben Zobrist doubled and Billy Butler was hit by an 0-2 pitch. Cody Allen came on and got Ike Davis on a foul out for his 19th save, and third in three nights. Oakland’s only run came in the first after an error by second baseman Jason Kipnis.

Butler then had a sacrifice fly. Kendall Graveman (6-5) allowed four runs in 6⅔ innings for his first loss since June 13. Graveman’s 19-inning scoreless streak ended on Yan Gomes’ RBI double in the fourth that tied the score. Kipnis drew a bases-loaded walk in the sixth off reliever Drew Pomeranz to put Cleveland ahead 2-1. Francisco Lindor walked to force in another run and Michael Brantley had a two-run single. Cleveland has won four in a row and nine of 12. The Athletics have dropped nine of 14. Carlos Santana singled off Graveman to start the sixth and took third on Giovanny Urshela’s two-out single. Michael Bourn walked to load the bases. Pomeranz replaced Graveman but issued a five-pitch walk to Kipnis. Lindor walked on a full-count pitch, prompting a visit from pitching coach Curt Young.

Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin. How big a purchase motivator is the $20 discount on for those that already own the original game digitally? Sound off in the comments below.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment The signature bottle of Ran-Lew Dairy Milk Co. can be seen in local groceries and restaurants across Alamance County. Customers may notice the cows grazing on the label, the allure of “Cream Top Whole Milk” or the appeal of the farm’s nearby address in Snow Camp. What customers may not realize is that the entire Ran-Lew Dairy Milk package — from the milking of the cows to the bottling of the product — is done entirely on that Snow Camp farm without a single middleman. “We’re essentially the closest thing to raw milk you can get,” Ran-Lew Dairy owner Randy Lewis said. “We basically get the milk out of the cow, pasteurize it, put it in a bottle and then give it to you.” Because of the non-standardized process, the Ran-Lew products of whole, low-fat and chocolate milk sold at Company Shop Markets, Lowes Foods and other spots depend heavily on Lewis’ cows. “For most companies, whole milk is usually 3.25 percent butterfat,” he said. “But here it’s different as long as the milk meets the minimum percentage. If the cows are producing four percent butterfat, that’s what you get.” THE ORIGINS of Ran-Lew’s somewhere-around-4-percent-sometimes milk operation can be traced all the way back to the 19th century. There is no record for when the land was officially transferred over to the Lewis family, but it has been a part of its history for five generations. Lewis had comfortable success running the farm until 2009, when the struggling economy did a number on the family business. Costs to maintain the farm had increased and milk wasn’t selling. Lewis ultimately decided that bottling the milk on the farm, instead of needing to sacrifice a percentage of the profit to bottling companies, would keep the business afloat. He and his family run the bottling operation inside a refrigerated tractor-trailer, keeping the crates of milk bottles cold and profits high. The self-bottling operation differentiates Ran-Lew from nearby competition, such as Homeland Creamery in Julian, and Maple View Farm in Hillsborough. “They have their markets sewed up, so I felt that we had to do something to be different or else this wouldn’t work,” Lewis said. “So we take a natural approach by not homogenizing the milk. We don’t even own a cream separator.” Since the milk is non-homogenized, the cream rises to the top when sitting. This cream carries nutrients like Vitamin A and D, and is easier to digest, according to the Ran-Lew website. Although local farms compete in the same or similar markets, Lewis said they are all fighting the same large-scale battle — keeping their businesses alive in an age of big brand dairy products that dominate shelf space. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings thetimesnews.com",

Although local farms compete in the same or similar markets, Lewis said they are all fighting the same large-scale battle — keeping their businesses alive in an age of big brand dairy products that dominate shelf space. “We basically help producers like Randy overcome the barriers of distribution,” Growing Together Program Manager John Law said. “We open the doors and get them in places like Lowes Foods so they can start selling.” Law said he was drawn to the Lewis operation because of the strength of the milk itself and the uniqueness of Lewis bottling his own product. “The milk is as close as you can get to legally buying it straight out of the cow,” he said. “And this is really the only farm nearby that bottles its own milk.” But without a marketing team or funds to advertise, Law said it’s difficult to raise awareness of Ran-Lew milk. Word of mouth is still the most effective tool — it’s also the only one for the declining number of small business farms. “There are very few farms like Randy’s anymore,” Law said. “People around here getting milk from local farms used to be the rule, but now it’s the exception.” The growing appeal of foods not from genetically modified organisms may help. According to Lewis, Ran-Lew milk products will be essentially GMO-free by October. “When that happens, it will put us in a unique position,” he said. “If GMOs are the reason you’re buying organic foods, then we should be able to supply that market. It’s just a wider niche for us.” That cream isn’t cheap, either. Large dairy companies often separate the cream from the milk and use it for their ice cream and butter products, minimizing the cost and keeping profits high. But removing the cream would be removing the essence of Lewis’ product. “One reason we charge more than some companies do is that we leave the cream still in it,” Lewis said. “We can’t get rid of it. We have to have it in the milk because that’s all we sell and that sets us apart.” Then there is The Last Barn Dance, a short documentary directed by Jason Arthurs and Ted Richardson about Lewis keeping the Alamance County barn dancing tradition alive. It received Honorable Mention at the American Documentary Film Festival and was voted Best Short Documentary at the Kansas City Filmfest. “The movie is a third about the dancing, a third about my milk bottling plant and a third about my life as a small independent farmer,” Lewis said. Lewis isn’t planning on jumping to the movie industry any time soon. Instead, he’ll continue making his livelihood on the land his family has owned for more than a century, adapting his straight-from-the-farm milk operation to an era rarely kind to small business farmers. “We can’t make it in the corporate world since the economy has left us behind,” he said. “So you either have to make it here or quit.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "China (/ˈtʃaɪnə/; simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state located in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims the territories governed by Taiwan, a separate political entity officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), as its 23rd province, a claim which is controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas. The history of China goes back to the ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei. China had the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it as seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2013, it is the world's second-largest economy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), and is also the world's largest exporter and importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defence budget. The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BCIM and the G-20. China is a regional power within Asia and has been characterized as a potential superpower by a number of commentators.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Today, it starts to get really real for the more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants that work for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV). Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue. In years 2016 and 2018, flight attendants would instead get a 3 percent annual bonus, that would subsequently be taxed at 40 percent. And some flight attendants are upset about the new way vacation benefits will be calculated under terms of the proposed contract — a complicated system that will create a more defined two-tier culture of full-time and part-time employees at the airline. The new contract also calls for longer duty day hours for flight attendants in some instances, rising from 10.5 hours to 12 hours — which was not what many flight attendants were hoping to see in a new contract. But even much smaller things in the proposed contract are being viewed as losses by some flight attendants. They include a new provision that requires flight attendants to report for duty 45 minutes before the schedule departure of flights on Southwest's new — and much larger — Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that seats approximately 30 more passengers than the Boeing 737-700 series model. Previously, flight attendants were required to be at the plane 30 minutes before departure. Southwest Airlines is expected to add many more 737-800 aircraft to its fleet starting next year. One truly veteran Southwest Airlines flight attendant who has clocked well over 30 years with the carrier had this to say today after reading through the new proposed contract: \"I have seen enough and compared to our previous contract language to know for certain this is a concessionary contract. Also, even though there is no defined contract language for retroactive pay, it has always been negotiated for our flight attendants going back to the date the contract expired (in 2013 in this instance). There is no retro pay, just a signing bonus (in the proposed contract). The bonus is taxed at 40 percent.\" Other flight attendants I heard from today point the finger directly at Southwest management, including CEO Gary Kelly, for all the angst the new proposed contract is generating among flight attendants as they prepare to vote on it. Noted one flight attendant: \"The negative publicity Gary Kelly is getting in the media is exactly what he wants to sweep under the rug. He thrives on feeling everyone is behind him 100 percent.

Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue.

    "DiffbotBody": "In his first book, author Jason Smith explores the depravity and desperation required to maintain an opiate addiction so fierce, he finds himself jumping continents to avoid jail time and learns the hard way that some demons cannot be outrun. While teaching in Europe, he meets a prostitute who secures drugs for him at the dangerous price of helping out the Russian mafia; in China, he gets his Percocet and Xanax fix but terrifies a crowd of children and parents at his job in the process; and in Mexico, Smith thought a Tijuana jail cell would be the perfect place to kick his Fentanyl habit, but soon realizes that the power of addiction is stronger than his desire to escape it. The Bitter Taste of Dying paints a portrait of the modern day drug addict with clarity and refreshing honesty. With a gritty mixture of self-deprecation and light-hearted confessional, Smith’s memoir deftly describes the journey into the harrowing depths of addiction and demonstrates the experience of finally being released from it.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Washington's NFL team already knows what its next move is to protect its trademark: appeal to a higher court. But what it's doing and what it should be doing, according to at least one crisis communications expert, may be at odds. Daniel G. Hill, president of Ervin-Hill Strategy in D.C., said his advice to the team and owner Dan Snyder is to \"rip off the Band-Aid'' after U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of the Washington NFL team's federal trademark registrations. \"The team is in a difficult spot,'' said Hill. \"At some point, they are going to have to stop fighting it. The problem with these kinds of issues, race issues and things like that, is you can have great facts on your side. Dan Snyder can do polls of Native Americans and others who support the current name, but you only have to offend a small group for it not to work.'' Ervin-Hill, in the crisis communications side of its public relations business, works with athletes and sports teams, among others, when tricky situations arise. Hill wouldn't name specific clients on the crisis side for confidentiality reasons; Ervin-Hill also works with athletes through the company's Pro Impact service, which consults and advises on image branding (professional boxer Heather \"the Heat\" Hardy is one Pro Impact client). Hill said Washington's NFL team will likely eventually be forced — for financial or other reasons — to change the team's nickname and Hill doesn't see the social pressure letting up any time soon, even as the team has vowed to forge ahead in the court system, and its next step is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. How would Hill handle it? \"The way I like to tackle these things is if I know eventually I have to do something, I do it more immediately, even if it doesn’t fit with what I want or what my client wants,'' said Hill. \"If they eventually have to change the name they should get it out of the way. This is sports; you’re not going to lose your fans. The Wizards are as popular today as they were when they were the Bullets. \"[The team] is treating this like a mundane legal matter. Arguing the name is historic doesn't really do anything in light of what's happening in the country. The name has color and 'skin' in it. And those two things, right now more than ever in the last 50 years, we need to get away from. Them fighting it at this particular moment makes absolutely no sense.\" If the team continues to fight, via the appeals process — the case would be heard by a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit. and it must file within 30 days of Wednesday's ruling — it will be a lengthy battle. Jesse A. Witten, the lead attorney for the Native Americans fighting the trademark fighting the team over the team’s trademark protections, said the appeals process could take 18 months \"plus or minus a few months\" to play out. If the team loses and wants to appeal, it would have to go to the Supreme Court, which picks and chooses the cases it hears.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Greece has submitted a new set of reform proposals to eurozone leaders It will form a last ditch attempt to reach an agreement with its creditors Details of proposals will be reviewed ahead of crucial summit on Sunday Greek leaders have pledged to reform the pension system and raise taxes In return, they have asked creditors for a three-year debt adjustment plan Alexis Tsipras is facing the difficult challenge of trying to convince his party to back a harsh new austerity package in return for a €53.5 billion bailout and restructuring of debt repayments. Less than a week after urging his country to reject milder cuts in a referendum, the Greek Prime Minister is now asking his hard left Syriza party to effectively sign off on a dramatic U-turn. If backed by the party and accepted by creditors, the reforms would raise corporate and shipping tax, increase the country's 'luxury' tax and implement a levy on TV advertisements immediately. It pledged to complete the tender process for the privatisation of its regional airports, as well as ports in Piraeus, Thessaloniki and Hellinikon. The Government would also transfer its remaining shares in Greek telecoms companies into private hands. All of this comes just 10 days after 60 per cent of Greek voters said they opposed further austerity measures in the July 5 referendum - a position the country's hard left government supported. Scroll down for video The proposals were sent to rescue creditors for approval at emergency meetings of European Union leaders and finance ministers over the weekend. The proposed new bailout worth nearly €53.5 billion would be Greece's third since it lost market access in 2010. But in an unusual procedure, Tsipras is first seeking authorization from parliament to negotiate with the creditors based on the proposal in a vote Friday. He is essentially asking his Syriza party to sign off on the U-turn despite more than 60 percent of voters opposing more austerity in the July 5 referendum. Tsipras was convening his party's lawmakers for discussions Friday morning before the parliamentary debate. The coalition government has 162 seats in the 300-member parliament and pledged backing on a deal from a large section of opposition lawmakers. But failure to deliver votes from his own government would likely topple his coalition. A prominent dissenter, Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, urged the government not to sign a third bailout. 'The choices we have are tough ... but the worst, the most humiliating and unbearable choice is an agreement that will surrender, loot and subjugate our people and this country,' he told a business conference on Thursday, before the Greek proposal was finalized. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou said the austerity climb-down was the only way Greece could survive the current economic crisis. 'I think we have no other option (than to accept the creditors' claims). The other is to exit the eurozone but neither the society or the administration is prepared to do so. If you don't have a plan B then you have the accept the (stronger) force,' he said. Asked what the point in the holding a referendum was when the government U-turned on the terms only days later, Kouloglou said: 'The creditors wanted it in the first place. There's also a culture of reprisals here, people will be punished because they voted no to the creditors.' Speaking of Greece's proposal, the MEP said he thought the request to restructure Greece's debt repayments was key to the agreement, branding the current arrangement 'unsustainable'. Michael Fuchs, Germany deputy chairman of CDU told the programme: 'At the moment we are just studying it (the proposals) and we really have to make sure the debt sustainability is now served, if that is not functioning (then) it doesn't make sense.' 'We have to check whether these measures, these new rules which they have proposed, are capable to really serve that idea. It's very important that we go forward but it's not our mistake or our fault. The Greeks have been waiting days to come up with proposals and now we have to check it.' I have a problem to trust it. What's the difference between Sunday and today? On Sunday the Greek people voted against these measurements, and against all these kinds of increases of VAT and (things like) all this. Now what is the situation? I'm sorry,' Beating a midnight deadline by almost two hours, the spokesman for Dutch eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem tweeted that the proposals were received and that it was 'important for institutions to consider these in their assessment' of the Greek situation. News the plans have been finalised comes as the country's Prime minister Alexis Tsipras met with finance ministry officials a day after the government requested a new three-year aid programme from Europe's bailout funds - and promised to immediately enact reforms, including to taxes and pensions, in return. Earlier yesterday, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici had warned it was a 'decisive' day for Europe. He had stated he was hopeful a new Greek bailout deal was possible, in exchange for 'concrete, complete' reform proposals. 'I have the sense that the dialogue is established, or restored, and that there is a way out,' Mr Moscovici said. Failure to reach a deal could be the first step towards Greece leaving the shared euro currency. The last-minute negotiations come amid bank closures in Greece, where capital controls have been imposed that restrict Greeks to cash withdrawals of 60 euro (£43) per day. The closures have been extended through to Monday. Pensioners without bank cards have been particularly hard hit as they have struggled to access their accounts. Certain bank branches opened last week to allow them to withdraw a weekly allowance of 120 euro each. The government announced on Wednesday this was being renewed so they could withdraw the same sum. Hundreds of elderly Greeks lined up outside banks yesterday morning. Hopes for a deal rose after Donald Tusk, who chairs the EU summits, said that Greece's plan would have to be matched by creditors' suggestions on how to make the country's debt manageable in the longer term. 'The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,' Mr Tusk said. Easing the terms of Greece's existing bailout loans has been a key dividing issue in the bailout talks for months - with Greece and the International Monetary Fund pressing in favour and key European states like Germany resisting the idea. Greece's proposals will now be examined by the 'troika' of creditor institutions - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and IMF - before going on to political leaders. Mr Tusk, the former Polish premier, has set a special summit of all 28 European Union members on Sunday as the final deadline for a deal to bail out Greece and keep it in the European single currency. Greece's Leftist premier Tsipras has called for a reduction of Greece's massive €320 billion debt mountain to be part of any deal for its third international bailout since 2010. But Germany and many other eurozone nations reject any move to write off Greek debts, especially after Greeks in a referendum last weekend backed Tsipras's decision to reject the creditors' demands for further austerity. A spokesman for the European Commission said Wednesday that its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had called earlier this week for debt sustainability to be part of a Greek deal 'under the understanding that that would come later in October, provided that the other conditions would have been met.' IMF chief Christine Lagarde said Wednesday that a new programme to prop up Greece's finances would require creditors to restructure debt in addition to the reforms Athens must make. 'The other leg is debt restructuring, which we believe is needed in the case of Greece for it to have debt sustainability,' she told a conference in Washington. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew made similar comments, saying the IMF was right to focus on the issue and that Greece's debt 'is not sustainable.' But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after an emergency summit of the 19 nations that use the single currency on Tuesday that debt relief would be illegal under the EU's treaties. 'A haircut is out of question,' she said when asked about the possibility of restructuring Greek debt.",

Ex-teacher sentenced after pleading guilty to sex with boys The suspected gangster behind the \"senseless murder\" of a 7-year-old watching July 4th fireworks on a Chicago street was arrested Wednesday more than 400 miles away in Wisconsin. Rasheed Martin, 20, was taken into custody by local police and sheriff's deputies without incident at an apartment complex in Superior, Wis., after a murder warrant was issued Friday, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said. Martin has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Amari Brown, who was in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood when Martin allegedly struck the child in a gang-related drive-by shooting. The intended target was Brown's father, Antonio Brown, who police called a ranking gang member in the Four Corner Hustlers. \"Baby Amari was not a gang leader,\" Rev. Ira Acree told NBC Chicago at the boy's funeral on Sunday. \"So we must do all we can to get the killer off the streets.\" Antonio Brown, who police said had a rap sheet that included 45 arrests, raced his son to the hospital, clutching him in the back seat of a car. The boy, shot in the chest, couldn't be saved. Amari was one of three killed and 27 wounded in a violent July 4 night in Chicago, The Chicago Tribune reported. \"Quite frankly, he should not have been on the street. This is exactly what the men and women of Chicago (police) are up against,\" Chicago Police Chief Garry McCarthy afterward. \"I'm angry, I'm frustrated that we're here again talking about a senseless murder. This has got to stop.\" Brown has been out on $50,000 bail since an April arrest on a gun charge, police said. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.",

Incorporating a variety of activities into your workout routine can help you stay physically fit. Aerobic or cardiovascular exercises like brisk walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling help strengthen your heart because it keeps it pumping at a higher rate for an extended period of time. Aerobic activities also help manage blood pressure and cholesterol, strengthen the spine and prevent weight gain while improving your energy level and simply making you feel good, explains the University of Maryland Medical Center.

    "DiffbotBody": "A Canadian wildlife officer has been suspended without pay from his position with the Ministry of Environment’s conservation program after refusing to kill orphaned bear cubs, local reports said. The fate of two cubs, a brother and sister, was left to Conservation Officer Bryce Casavant who manages wildlife in a rural corner of British Columbia . The bumbling pair tumbled out of a tree only to be caged by Casavant after returning to where their mother had been killed for repeatedly raiding a meat freezer near Port Hardy on the northern tip of Vancouver Island, according to CBC News. Rather than put both bears down, Casavant wrangled the critters and dropped tto a nearby veterinary hospital placing the young ones into the care of the North Island Wildlife Recovery Association. The bears were reportedly fearful of humans unlike their mother and considered by the recovery center’s management to be good candidates for rehabilitation. A petition and a crowdsourced fundraiser organized by the recovery center and even a local community newspaper, the North Island Gazette, aims to introduce the bears back to the wilderness after an 18-month rehabilitation program. The advocacy also puts in a good word for Casavantwho is suspended over his decision to spare the bears. “These cubs did nothing,” Robin Campbell, the manager of the North Island Wildlife Recovery Association, told CBC News. Even British comedian Ricky Gervais pleaded on Twitter for the Conservation Officer Service to “reinstate this honorable man.” The petition asking the province's Minister of Environment, Mary Polak, to bring Casavant back has garnered about 123,000 signatures The Conservation Officer Service is investigating the ordeal and Casavant’s actions. He is stationed in Port McNeill with the Royal Canadian Mounties Police and is a former military police officer who served a combat tour in Afghanistan, the Gazette reported in June. Casavant’s position with the Conservation Officer Service was already expected to expire in September following a two-year stint that garnered 153 calls reporting human encounters with cougars, deer and bears. ROME — Italian police said on Wednesday they had seized assets worth $2.2 billion and issued 41 arrest warrants in raids on gambling companies in Italy and abroad run by the 'Ndrangheta mafia organization. Police believe the firms, including six that were operating out of Malta, were used to launder vast sums of illicit cash. Italy's mafia groups, including the 'Ndrangheta from the southern region of Calabria, the Camorra from Naples and Sicily's Cosa Nostra, have strengthened their grip on southern Italy's economy and spread to the richer north during a three-year economic slump. Among the targets of Wednesday's operation were 1,500 betting shops, 82 gambling websites, 45 Italian companies and 11 foreign firms, as well as \"innumerable\" property assets, the financial police said in a statement. Apart from the firms run from Malta, two were in Spain, two in Romania and one in Austria. The Calabrian mafia has grown rich on the drugs trade, becoming one of Europe's biggest importers of South American cocaine, with strong ties to Mexican and Colombian cartels. It also runs companies in sectors including trucking and hospitality, with a stranglehold on the economy of Calabria, where unemployment is above 20%.",

Read More [Editor’s Note: Be sure to join IGN and Harmonix for the world gameplay premiere of Rock Band 4 in our live stream on Friday, May 15 at 12pm PT/3pm ET/7pm GMT. That's 5am AEST on Saturday.] Many would agree that Rock Band 2 was the peak of Rock Band’s campaign design. Rock Band 4 aims to outperform the 2008 game’s limited story elements and band interaction with a simple, strong new feature: Gigs. “A gig is a new structure that we’ve put into Rock Band 4 to sort of capture the feeling of a live performance,” Lead Designer Chris Foster told IGN. It’s also an incredible way to have an extra layer of fun, or cause tension with, the people you’re playing with. Here’s hoping Rock Band 4 doesn’t cause any band breakups. You'll 'as a band' be able to vote on a setlist. Foster explained that the act of performing live music isn’t represented completely accurately in previous Rock Band games. You don’t hop on stage, play a song, and leave. “It’s sort of the ebb and flow of the arc of a performance over successive songs. So, like, the crowd coming with you, or potentially you needing to win them over…it’s a sense of momentum and pacing. So what we wanted to do with this is capture the sense of a gig and use it for narrative means, for new gameplay and emotional experiences within the Rock Band framework.” Essentially, Gigs operate similar to older games’ Setlists, or Rock Band 3’s Challenges. “It’s a series of songs subdivided into a series of sets with set breaks,” said Foster. A Gig we played involved four songs in two sets of two. A set break between each duo had stuff we’ve never seen in Rock Band before. “If you’re the vocalist, you’re able to perform a sort of stage patter…it’s sort of like adding some LARPing to your Rock Band experience,” Foster said. “You’re sort of role-playing a different event that is sort of happening offstage, or got you to the show in the first place inside the campaign, we’re using them to deliver the narrative experience.” So what does that mean, gameplay-wise? “They need to be really fun to play,” Foster said. “Particularly as the crowd is reacting. So, you’ll do your crowd work as a vocalist, the band will play a couple of songs, and then you’ll take another break. And in those breaks, you’ll be able to do a lot of voting. In some cases, there’ll be a set list that is predefined, like in previous Rock Bands. But in other cases, you’ll – as a band – be able to vote on a setlist.” Choices appear between sets, drawn from your music library and the gig’s theme/genre. Bandmates have a limited time to choose the song they all wish to play -- which could lead to interesting, awkward interactions with you band. Your guitarist may decide on a spectacular, fun song the vocalist doesn’t know, or can’t sing to properly. An exhausted drummer can vote for something laid-back, while the rest of his bandmates troll her with a gnarly drum solo track. “It becomes a really interesting collaborative and competitive experience, as you’ll have people say what they want and what they absolutely don’t want,” Foster said. “It’s fun, because when you’re beat-matching, it’s tunnel vision; you’re focused on your instrument, you’re barely aware of other people if they’re falling out or if you can save them. But the moments between songs, we’re able to come up with these other game experiences, and they can be really fun.” Fighting or messing with your band isn’t necessarily to your advantage of course. You can carry over your multipliers and Overdrive power between songs during gigs, adding a small but interesting extra layer of strategy that can affect your band’s score. Gigs can be played for kicks in a party setting, for sure, but they’re also core to Rock Band 4’s campaign -- which involves an interesting branching narrative similar to an RPG. We’ll have more on that for you later this month.

    "DiffbotBody": "Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single. Its ornate but in-the-pocket production is as silky and flawlessly orchestrated a track as Quik has made since the late '90s, and it boasted one of the best lead-off lines for a rap verse this year: \"Now what they want to go cancel Arsenio Hall for?/ Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for.\" Hall’s talk show rose to prominence in the early '90s, around the same time that Quik was finding commercial success, and he appeared on \"Arsenio\" a few times both to rap and DJ; last year—on a newly resurrected version of the show—the rapper announced the release of The Midnight Life. In a song that mostly celebrates living in the present—more focused on the narrative of maintaining than reclaiming glory—the nostalgic line feels poignant; like second-time-loser Arsenio, the perpetually \"most underrated\" Quik has been declared down for the count more than once, and may now be winding down himself. But as in the case of most of Quik’s work, the complaint is just a point in the rapper’s tangled constellation of talking points (mainly, taunts and come-ons to adversaries, fair-weather fans, and the female population of South Central at large), which are as full of ingenious contradictions as his beats. —Winston Cook-Wilson DJ Quik: \"Pet Sematary\" There was a time when the killing in a Lauryn Hill song was done softly and figuratively, through the power of music. That time was long ago. In the late 1990s, a false rumor about the singer/songwriter who would become perhaps rap's most gifted recluse supposedly saying she'd rather die than have white people buying her albums spread so widely there's a Snopes.com page dedicated to debunking it. Over the years since the former Fugees member's sole solo studio album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as she has drifted in and out of the public eye, her self-aggrandizing statements and unfortunate habit of showing up late for live shows have continued to divide, in ways that still say more about the culture than about her. When Hill went to prison to serve a three-month sentence for tax evasion in 2013, she opened herself to further miscomprehension by discussing her conviction in terms of slavery, colonialism, and institutionalized racism. It might not have played well in Peoria, but she was bringing up a legacy America has yet to escape, in ways that became tragically obvious this year. In the same pre-prison pronouncement, Hill said, \"You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\" In 2012, she had premiered a spoken-word piece titled \"Black Rage\", which turned the lyrical framework of Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein's \"My Favorite Things\" into a prolix litany of the crimes that one group of people have perpetrated against another, and a stinging endorsement of anger as an antidote to fear; in later live versions the interpolation became, like John Coltrane's classic cover, a musical one, as well. When the artist, now known professionally as Ms. Lauryn Hill, shared \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" in late August, with a call for peace in Missouri, the times had caught up with her song. She once told an interviewer, \"If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children,\" and this sketch, recorded in her living room, benefits by couching its broad social themes in family-like intimacy; her kids' voices can be heard behind her deepening, huskier roar, along with acoustic guitar and a murmuring rhythm. Some will share Hill's fury, some won't, but her unexpurgated message of focused resilience points toward part of what has been missing all along: A mutual understanding. To promote a new pay-for-view concert video, Hill recently shared a clip of herself performing the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" live in Brooklyn. In the song, as on the original, she raps, \"While you're imitating Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone.\" Simone, the subject of a controversial upcoming biopic, prefigured aspects of Hill's career trajectory in her own evolution toward racial confrontation. Simone reportedly warned Martin Luther King Jr., on meeting him, that she wasn't nonviolent. \"Not to worry, sister,\" King responded; she even later insisted upon being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" You'd never guess it by the ongoing rounds of backlash against Hill, which prompted Talib Kweli to write an essay defending her this year, but this mere Ms. has yet to go as far in her radicalism as the late legend, who, singing the then-new \"Mississippi Goddam\" at Carnegie Hall in 1964, blithely informed a mostly white audience, \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies/ You're all gonna die and die like flies.\" But \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" belongs to that tradition, one of righteous indignation in the face of injustice, speaking to the persecuted wherever they may be, whatever they might look like. And it shows that, for all the actual death and cruelty in the headlines, the sound of music can still be quietly devastating. —Marc Hogan The other side of \"Chorus\", a 12'' single issued at the start of the year by the globally minded electronic producer Holly Herndon, sounds like an audition tape for the relatively esoteric sound-art label Editions Mego. During \"Solo Voice\", slivers and snapshots of her voice twist into pointillist spires—chirpy and more musical than the most recent experiments of clear inspiration Florian Hecker, but only by degrees. Even Herndon’s most kinetic work has always seemed as driven by ideas as approachability, and \"Solo Voice\" is an unabashed expression of the former. Could a disembodied and dissected human voice be built into something new with computers? \"Chorus\" explores a similar line of inquiry. Herndon splits her simple, fetching melody into bits, so that her words seem sung by a cyborg programmed with a speech impediment. Syllables end abruptly, stand alone, and stretch over open space. But Herndon twists those samples of herself around beats that sometimes boom and burst like dubstep and sometimes stutter and sprint like IDM. In the space between the two, Herndon laces a panoply of fragments gathered piecemeal as she browsed online. The result, vividly illustrated in a subsequent video collaboration with Japanese artist Akihiko Taniguchi, blurs the relationship between web and browser, machine and user, data and devourer. Herndon becomes the principal input in a system bigger than herself, and she tries to be altered without being absorbed. It’s a canny reflection on our digital lives, rendered with a physicality that pulls it back into our own mainframe. —Grayson Haver Currin \"I Am Not Afraid\", the track that kicks off the gorgeous In Conflict, is as much a riddle as it is a song. Those who may have arrived at Owen Pallett’s music by way of his theoretical explications of pop tracks wouldn’t have been surprised at the obvious intelligence of the writing here, or the foreboding and beauty of the music behind it. It would have been more discomfiting to reckon with the intense strangeness of lyrics that seem several worlds away from the crush-love-heartbreak-repeat cycle of the pop music Pallett clearly understands so well. Pallett has said that In Conflict is the first of his records on which he tried to write lyrics that were both non-allegorical and autobiographical. But even if the material \"I Am Not Afraid\" draws upon comes from Pallett’s own life, the song is extraordinarily rich in imagery and metaphor, whether it’s Pallett leaving his \"violin unattended in a cab or restaurant\" or sharing lyrics like \"They told me to chew on a toothpick/ They told me to take a deep breath.\" These are depictions of anxiety and anger—heady emotions clashing with the record’s central message that its subject is not afraid and salvation may be found in discipline. So while there’s clearly that eponymous conflict in effect here, the idea motivating the song remains fleeting. The music of \"I Am Not Afraid\" is mostly gorgeous as it transitions from violin to piano and back, but it is also strange, and sometimes frightening (a result of Pallett dropping what he calls \"black notes\"—i.e., the exact wrong note for the melody—into the mix). Accepting the discomfort of the very music here, and accepting the discomfort of the lyrics, becomes both a metaphor and a microcosm of the experience that those born into any of the groups that hold dominion (whites, males, cisgenders) must undertake to reckon with their unearned status. To draw on what Pallett has said directly, this musical and lyrical confusion also functions as a metaphor for his own \"displacement and dysphoria.\" By taking the political and rendering it both personal and deliberately inscrutable, Pallett has managed to confound in the best way possible and create a relatable pop experience for voices that are too often ignored. —Jonah Bromwich It’s been an art from blues to Britney: the song as extended double entendre, one that can come off either unassailably clean or unspeakably filthy depending on the listener’s life experience and cleanliness of mind (or nearness to a Google searchbox). \"Love Me Harder\" is sort of the opposite: even when it’s clean it sounds teasingly off, and even when it’s dirty, it sounds so disarmingly spit-shine clean. Much of it’s the premise: pairing a singer who was a babysitter on Nickelodeon less than half a year ago with a singer whose discography contains endless variations on permanently corrupting young ingenues, with no apologies and no inclinations to change that. Even more of it’s the execution: organ peals timed like winks after each line; Grande switching emotional beats like poses, her voice either knowing beyond her years or just polished to sound like it, with no indication as to which; Tesfaye revisiting the sturdy nocturnal electro-house of his Kavinsky collaboration (a sound that’s been fast adopted by the pop trickbook, from megastars to newcomers), leering about his rep and finding a way to describe hardcore porn acts in PG terms. When these tracks fail, they’re the most embarrassing failures an artist can have; when they succeed, the sleight of song can be breathtaking. Here’s to a generation of kids realizing horrifying things in 2020 about their teenage jam—and what lodged it in their mind. —Katherine St. Asaph Ariana Grande: \"Love Me Harder\" [ft. The Weeknd] Tobias Jesso Jr. isn't the first guy to have his heart squashed by Los Angeles. After failing to make it as a pop songwriter, breaking up with his girlfriend, getting hit by a car, and—icing on the cake—moving to to Vancouver to help care for his ailing mother, balloons fell from the ceiling as Jesso became the world's one billionth failed songwriter. So he dusted off his sister's old piano, wrote a few heart-stricken ballads, and posted them to Youtube. What happened next was unlikely: An email to Chet \"JR\" White (whose band Girls had just broken up) led to a True Panther signing and bam—Jesso's back on his feet, with a debut tiled Goon slated for next year. His breakthrough track, \"True Love\", is perhaps an even less likely success. About as bald-faced and hopelessly romantic as music in 2014 comes, Jesso calls on the spirits of the underdog singer-songwriters of the '70s (think Randy Newman circa Good Old Boys), nicks the melody from Nelly's \"Dilemma\" almost wholesale, and delivers one of the best lump-in-your throat choruses of the year. Which isn't to mention that it sounds like a half-tempo version of the saddest '80s sitcom theme song ever recorded. But there's something so worn and natural about it, it's hard to think of it as anything but the purest declaration of the heart. Call up the YouTube video for \"True Love\", and you'll find a family photograph of Jesso at maybe seven or eight-years-old, looking up at the camera with his fingers poking at a cheap Casio keyboard. It's hard not to believe the kid would make it after all. —Zach Kelly Tobias Jesso Jr.: \"True Love\" Beyoncé hasn’t been a traditional singles artist for years—4, her 2011 opus, didn’t even put anything in the top 10. And when you Beyoncé not only an album into the world but over a dozen songs with prime-time-ready videos, the formula’s bound to be shaken even further. The obvious industry singles—Ryan Tedder collab \"XO\", erstwhile Katy Perry song \"Pretty Hurts\", whatever “Standing on the Sun” was supposed to be in the months Before Knowles—floundered; even \"Drunk in Love\", a bona fide hit that rode the pomp and TV performance circuit to No. 2, seemed more like a populist underdog fighting chart trends than a preordained smash. Yet there were alternatives: 14 songs, all different, yet each personality-packed, like a personality quiz without any of the data-mining malaise—except the sort that produces people’s-choice singles. And the people’s choice, it turns out, was \"Partition\". If Beyoncé-the-statement was reducible to a single track, this would be it. Jay-Z asserts his presence without actually commandeering the track to rap about breastses and breakfast. Beyoncé thoroughly enjoys her reverie, fetishizing their own celebrity because who else gets to do it? And the track balances no-nonsense hitmaking—the hook’s her most traditionally urban radio-ready since B’Day, the beat roaring from simmer to insatiable and back within seconds—and nonchalant trolling. If you think \"Partition\" is a load of oversharing in a cab seat, Beyoncé is mocking you via a French Big Lebowski lecture. If you think \"Partition\" is a big cameras-flashing FEMINIST TRIUMPH, Beyoncé will make you frame that around a goofy Big Lebowski quote, knowing you’ll share it on all platforms anyway. It’s provocative, let’s say; it gets the people going. —Katherine St. Asaph It wasn’t so long ago that being a Young Thug fan felt like you were in on rap’s most rewarding secret. Revelling in the unpredictability of his I Came From Nothing mixtape series, I can honestly admit that, no, I didn’t see his success coming: even at his poppiest, Thug felt way too weird to transcend cult status. Even on his breakthrough release, 2013’s 1017 Thug, the bits that rose to the top were highly tweetable but barely marketable; keep in mind, this was still pre-\"Versace\", a song that would be used as a punchline by \"serious\" rap fans as often as it would be celebrated later that year. That feels like ages ago. Thug closes 2014 as, if not quite a household name, an unavoidable presence in the rap landscape. A short list of stars who co-opted his once-singular swag this year includes Nicki Minaj, T.I., Gucci Mane, and Lil Wayne (his closest spiritual progenitor, who at this point feels prudish in relation), not to mention the dozens of impressionable ATLiens who’ve practically made his yelps and chirps into its own subgenre. It isn’t that Thug’s succeeded in spite of his quirks: they’ve become the hook. The odder he gets, the more people respond, his endless idiosyncrasies feeding the insatiable demand for clicks that’s come to reshape online media. Such a near-sighted focus on the \"weirdness\" sells Thug short. Of his three major singles this year, each highlighted a distinct facet of his skill set. \"Danny Glover\" was peak zaniness, probing the outer limits of what constitutes catchiness; \"The Blanguage\", in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin, presented Thug as a deft lyricist and effective balladeer. But best of all was \"Stoner\", in which words fell short as descriptors and functioned instead as measurements of rhythm and space. If anything, it made more sense as a grime song than a rap song, with Dun Deal’s spare beat challenging Thug to find new ways to make himself comfortable within it. It struck a precarious balance between restraint and release: an unsure hand could've sent the whole thing toppling. It wasn’t weird—it was masterful. —Meaghan Garvey Young Thug: \"Stoner\" There are qualities about Mike Hadreas that make him seem heroic: His songbook takes on themes of trauma and addiction, the body and identity, all in a way that seems designed to protect us—a reminder that we're not alone in our otherness. This year, Hadreas has been selling T-shirts depicting an emasculated Eminem, a proper jab at one of popular music's most problematic living artists. On the shirt, Slim is clad in coral lipstick, just a few shades lighter than the tint Hadreas wore on his watershed \"Letterman\" performance in October, contorting a slow, sultry sway through \"Queen\". Indeed, Hadreas' work as Perfume Genius has opened a crucial dialogue over the past half decade. Recall the 2012 incident with his 16-second YouTube ad for Put Your Back N 2 It getting censored for \"promoting mature sexual themes\" because it featured two shirtless men hugging. As there's no shortage of topless folks on YouTube, the message from Google was clear: it was the queerness that was unsuitable and—as the corporation wrote in a statement—\"not family safe.\" And so, should you need convincing, the quaking \"Queen\" is empirically necessary. \"No family is safe/ When I sashay,\" Hadreas asserts through expressive breaths on the refrain of the year, channeling personal rage into a surreal energy, addressing gay panic—the idea that one's visible otherness as a gay individual makes people uncomfortable, that it’s perceived as a threat to the straight world. Hadreas sounds just as defiant and poetic in 2014 as Patti Smith did in 1975 telling us how Jesus did not die for her sins. And like Smith's earth-shattering subversions of the female archetype, Hadreas' provocations are confident, uncompromising, epic—he appoints himself \"queen\" and owns the supposed flaws of his sexuality (\"cracked, peeling, riddled with disease\") with a deviant wink and demonic smirk. One would expect music that is both radically politicized and universal from someone who grew up listening to \"a lot of badass feminist music\" and who says he's seen Sleater-Kinney at least 13 times. His words alone have such inspired power—imagine them publicly broadcast on a marquee in LED lighting, like a Jenny Holzer installation—but \"Queen\" does not just illuminate the potential of explicit language. It has few aesthetic precedents, though it pushes the borders of pop and avant-gardism in a way Arthur Russell would have appreciated. The cool drag of a drum contribution from PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish morphed the song into what has been aptly described in interviews as \"stoner glam.\" There is a tornado swirling—a deep, booming low-end; abrasive synths rolling into an ecstatic dreamscape; passing clouds made of soul—and Hadreas is at the eye of the storm, a light steadily beaming from the chaos of the world, stepping into the future. \"Queen\" is a gay anthem, but it also empathizes broadly with all people who biologically have less direct access to the top seats in society. In a year that rendered the world's rampant, widespread injustice so depressingly apparent, what could keep us believing that all this music stuff matters so much? It's songs like \"Queen\" and the sea changes they summon that give it purpose. The future of pop belongs to people like Hadreas, who will take us forward to new places we didn't know we needed to go. Surrounded by this loud, extreme music, it sounds like nothing can hurt him now. —Jenn Pelly Perfume Genius: \"Queen\"",
    "LabBody": "96. Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single.

Although some parents definitely disagree with the notion of “sparing the rod,” apparently, local officials are arguing that this mother took the sentiment way out of context. It has been reported that the prolonged beating lasted for more than an hour. According to WAFB, Renora Seaberry is behind bars for the beating of her child. Officers were dispatched to Seaberry’s apartment after receiving calls about the child’s agonizing screams. The caller indicated that the beating had been going on for “more than an hour,” according to the police report. It has been reported that the child suffered “severe bruising and swelling,” with visible bruises on both arms and another large mark on one leg. When Seaberry was questioned by investigators, she admitted that she’d hit the child with a belt on both arms and legs. However, local authorities argue that her actions far exceed justifiable punishment. In fact, her actions are being described as “extreme and unjustifiable punishment.” Renora Seaberry is currently being held in East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. According to NOLA, no bond has been set for the 35-year-old mother. Surprisingly, her actions have sparked quite a debate. Of course, many readers condemned Seaberry’s disciplinary methods but there have been some who have also questioned the series of events that led to the punishment. However, regardless of the circumstances, the American Academy of Pediatricians insists “striking” a child — also referred to as “corporal punishment” — is never an effective disciplinary action. “The American Academy of Pediatricians strongly opposes striking children for any reason,” said Stacie LeBlanc, the executive director of the New Orleans Children’s Advocacy Center. “There are at least 25 studies out there showing that spanking is not only ineffective, it can also cause psychological and emotional harm.” Do you believe corporal punishment is ever justifiable?

Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios are doing something unique though by offering a hefty discount for those that already own a digital copy of for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Pre-orders for popped up on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store over the past day. The remaster of the last-gen game normally costs $39.99. However, users that already have a digital copy of the original Dishonored in their library of games can pick it up for $20 instead. The move to discount a game like this for existing owners is welcome from a consumer standpoint. We’ve seen it a couple of times before such as with State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition and its upgrade where existing Xbox 360 owners received a 33 percent discount earlier this year. The surprising difference with Dishonored: Definitive Edition is that the original Dishonored was offered for free for the Xbox 360 as part of the Games with Gold program in August of last year. Meanwhile, PlayStation Plus subscribers on the PS3 received the game for free in April of this year. Offering half off the Definitive Edition after so many digital copies of the original were downloaded for free is a bold move, but one that is sure to get repeat purchases, so to speak. Dishonored: Definitive Edition contains more than just the original game. It also includes the two-story DLC expansions – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches plus the Dunwall City Trials add-on that tests your stealth and combat skills as well as the Void Walker’s Arsenal add-on pack that offers character bonuses and additional bone charm slots. Naturally, the Definitive Edition features improved graphics and effects over the original version of Dishonored. An exact resolution and framerate hasn’t been announced yet, but 1080p and 30 fps should be considered the minimum. The release of is currently scheduled for August 25 in North America and August 28 in Europe. This does, of course, keep fans of the franchise busy until Dishonored 2 releases in spring 2016. The remastered release of also helps Arkane Studios become familiar with both the PS4 and Xbox One. Dishonored 2 is set on an all new island and will allow players the choice between using Corvo once again or the new assassin/returning character of Emily Kaldwin.

What’s Happening: The Error on Dylann Roof's Background Check The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans. When the cyberbreach was first reported in June, only 4 million Americans, mostly government workers and contractors, were thought to be affected. The Confederate flag comes down in Columbia: One day after South Carolina lawmakers voted to remove the divisive symbol from state grounds, an honor guard removed it in a ceremony on Friday. A crowd cheered and chanted “U.S.A.” and “take it down” as the flag was lowered. The NCAA announced that the state is now eligible to host future tournaments.

We bore and burn out easily—particularly, it seems, when it comes to fitness.” Christopher Orr: “There’s plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted, and the minions themselves are consistently amusing...

David Frum explains why Jeb Bush’s focus on growing the GDP won’t necessarily improve American living standards. The core idea of the emerging Jeb Bush economic policy is that a bigger Gross Domestic Product will translate into more opportunity and higher wages for the average person. Over the past generation, however, rising GDP has not always improved living standards. A close look at the period in the past 40 years when living standards did improve, in the second half of the 1990s, reveals that the improvement was driven by a (temporary) pause in healthcare cost inflation.

    "LabBody": "What’s Happening: The Error. The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans. When the cyberbreach was first reported in June, only 4 million Americans, mostly government workers and contractors, were thought to be affected. The Confederate flag comes down in Columbia: One day after South Carolina lawmakers voted to remove the divisive symbol from state grounds, an honor guard removed it in a ceremony on Friday. A crowd cheered and chanted “U.S.A.” and “take it down” as the flag was lowered. The NCAA announced that the state is now eligible to host future tournaments. Snapshot. Quoted. News Quiz. 1.

Weekend Read. David Frum explains why Jeb Bush’s focus on growing the GDP won’t necessarily improve American living standards. The core idea of the emerging Jeb Bush economic policy is that a bigger Gross Domestic Product will translate into more opportunity and higher wages for the average person. Over the past generation, however, rising GDP has not always improved living standards. A close look at the period in the past 40 years when living standards did improve, in the second half of the 1990s, reveals that the improvement was driven by a (temporary) pause in healthcare cost inflation. When the cost of employee benefits rises more slowly, employee pay can rise more quickly. The tragedy of the American workplace is that employers continue to pay more for labor—but workers don’t receive that money. It is siphoned off by the healthcare industry. Verbs.

Co-owner Amy Bouzaglo said Thursday that she and husband Samy Bouzaglo are in final negotiations to sell the property in Scottsdale but that they are keeping the Amy's Baking Company name. She plans to focus on making desserts for Phoenix-area restaurants and online instructional cooking videos. The decision had nothing to do with lingering negative publicity from the show, though people on social media have assumed otherwise, she said. \"People want to say we're desperate and closing and bankrupt,\" Bouzaglo said. \"Sorry, we're not. Sorry to burst your bubble.\" The couple drew outrage and ridicule after a profanity-laced appearance on a May 2013 episode of \"Kitchen Nightmares\" that ended with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay walking away. \"Every day since the show has aired, I have received some kind of death threat,\" Bouzaglo said. \"Any other person on this planet, I don't know if they would have survived what we went through because it was horrible.\" Bouzaglo maintains the producers of the Fox series edited footage to paint her as a volatile restaurant owner. \"They got their drama,\" Bouzaglo said. \"It's OK. It is what it is. We learned. There's no hard feelings with anybody.\" The couple say they opted to sell because they also had issues with the building's former landlord. Bouzaglo says the landlord allowed construction in other spaces in the shopping center that led to a sewer-like odor seeping into their restaurant. taboola sponsored listings",

    "DiffbotBody": "Would you run from a dinosaur in these shoes? From dinosaur theme parks to the red carpets of Cannes, everyone seems to be talking about high-heeled shoes. Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: First, stand barefoot and then rise onto your toes repeatedly. Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

WHERE: Tim McLoone’s Supper Club, 1200 Ocean Ave., Asbury Park. 732-774-1155 or timmcloonessup perclub.com. HOW MUCH: $20, $25. MORE INFO: donmost.net. Donny Most is best known for his role as Ralph Malph on the classic sitcom \"Happy Days.\" But long before he caught the acting bug, Most was mesmerized by the sounds of big band singers playing standards, swing and jazz numbers. \"When I was about 9 I saw the movie ‘The Al Jolson Story,’ \" Most said by phone. \"I started buying his albums and singing along. In addition, my mom was into swing music, so I would hear Count Basie and others. By the time I was 15, I was singing in nightclubs in the Catskills.\" Most, whose singing soon took a back seat to his acting career, recently returned to his first love. He and his big band perform on Sunday in Asbury Park. \"I felt a really strong pull that I needed to do this now and in the way I always wanted to, which included picking out the right songs with the right arrangements,\" said Most, 61. \"I cover a wide variety of styles. We do Sinatra, Dean Martin, Basie, Nat King Cole, Diana Krall, some Tony Bennett and Mel Torme, and some more obscure songs.\" Just as Most discovered Jolson through film, he was introduced to his biggest influence by a trip to the cinema. \"In 1961, I saw ‘Come September’ with Rock Hudson, Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin,\" he said. \"There was a scene where Bobby Darin sang, and I went crazy over it. \"I connected with [Darin] more than anybody else,\" Most said of the \"Mack the Knife\" and \"Dream Lover\" singer. \"He was able to swing as good as anyone and combined a lot of different styles. He brought a blues and gospel and folk element to his music.\" Despite his early love of singing, the Brooklyn native said that he did not consider a professional career in the industry. Most began acting in his early teens and was appearing in commercials by age 16. \"Singing was a great experience, but all of a sudden I was going out on auditions and being booked on national commercials,\" he said. \"I began to take that path to a higher level.\" Most starred in \"Happy Days\" from 1974 to 1980 as Ralph Malph, the comic sidekick to Ron Howard’s Richie Cunningham character. He has since appeared in additional television roles and guest spots, taken on independent film acting and directing, and done voice acting for cartoons. Most directed three films, including \"The Last Best Sunday\" (1999), a feature film winner at the Telluride (Col.) IndieFest, and \"Moola\" (2007), for which he won the Outstanding Achievement in Directing award at the Newport Beach (Calif.) Film Festival. Most said he decided to pursue a big band project about a year and a half ago. Hi seven-piece band includes three horns and a rhythm section. He said his fellow performers have humbled him, and he’s gratified by audiences’ reactions. \"I feel very lucky and grateful hearing these great musicians, getting to sing incredible songs and watching people enjoy it,\" Most said. He said his audience includes \"Happy Days\" devotees who are not familiar with big band music, as well as swing and jazz aficionados who want to hear a new act. \"The majority of people are fans from the show or fans of this music, and they’re curious to see what I do with it,\" Most said. \"I’ve gotten those comments, ‘I didn’t know you could sing like this.’ I love getting those kinds of reactions.\" Most has yet to release an album, but that may change in the near future, he said. MUSIC Most has yet to release an album, but that may change in the near future, he said. \"We recorded a show and there might be a live CD,\" he said. \"What I really want to do is get into the studio and record. I think that’s going to happen sooner rather than later.\"",

At Vecernji, we have directed all of our thoughts to creating new revenue streams in the last several years. We are trying to create a community of fans around our niche media platforms (print and digital platforms) by producing relevant and useful content, which will support and participate in our non-publishing projects. The growing trend among all generations to participate in outdoor activities encouraged us to launch a niche bi-monthly magazine GoOUT and accompanying digital platform 18 months ago, since publishing is still our core business. Analysing the needs of people, we concluded that across all age groups they are most interested in running/jogging and in Nordic walking for the 50+ age group. At the same time, a market analysis showed that sufficient capacity does not exist in clubs or schools to absorb all of this interest. These findings led us to an idea to establish our school, at first only in the capital city of Croatia. That is how the “GoOUT School of Movement” originated as a logical complement to the previously mentioned media platforms. After the initial idea, about which everyone been very enthusiastic (after everyday stresses, most of us the best relaxation finds in running), we were faced with several challenges. We didn’t know anything about organising this kind of school. We didn’t have professional trainers. We didn’t have a location or permits. And, most importantly, we didn’t have an allocated budget. We had to go one step at a time. Initial business plan been made and we found that project could be mostly financed from monthly memberships and the sponsorship of related companies that were interested in reaching this target group/community. For professional assistance, we turned to the Faculty of Kinesiology, with which we reached an agreement in a very short time (much to our very great surprise) – five trainers for the running school and seven trainers for the Nordic walking school. The next step was to select a location and obtain a permit. We selected four locations, in consultation with the professional team of trainers, we designed the programms. Since the programmes involved running and walking, several training programmes for different weight classes, age groups and physical capabilities were set up. Babysitting would be provided in the morning and afternoon periods at two locations for the children of parents who were running or walking. This service was a unique offer on the market because no other school had it. We completed all of these preparations in 30 days and were ready to launch our sales effort! We simultaneously started sales to future attendees, exclusively using for promotion all of the media platforms of our house with BTL (below-the-line) activities at the locations — open houses and test trainings —nd to our potential sponsors (multi-vitamin drinks, sportswear, shoes, gadgets, vitamins, etc.). That was in September 2014. The goal was to start the school in November. We knew that it wasn’t the best time of year for outdoor activities, but we still decided to start (if we could get the required money from sponsors and enough potential participants) and to introduce the project by the spring of 2015, when the peak season begins. In the first wave, we concluded two-year contracts with two main sponsors and we started the school with a 130 attendees, who trained three times a week divided into seven groups and different time periods. In this way we ensured a satisfactory profit after covering the project costs (trainers, baby sitting, T-shirts for the attendees, etc.). Today, the school has around 400 attendees and 21 groups, and our profit margin is growing month by month. In addition to the regular trainings, we have also organised two running races and two Nordic walking excursions in the mountains, open to anyone who is interested. Revenues from the registration fees for these events and the revenues from smaller/one-time sponsors are “icing on the cake” within P\u0026L. We can now safely our project is a success — with a current profit margin is 60%. At a time when all media companies, or at least a majority of them, are faced with a constant decline in classic revenues, we have learned that a good project without an allocated budget can still be launched and create extra profit for a company. For us, the definition of a good project means several things: To create a community of readers by quality content around niche media platforms. To recognise the needs of that community and to find empty space on the market. To create additional services or products that satisfy those needs an charge them. To maximise existing resources and to gather a team (project management, marketing, sales) to launch and implement a project that believes in its success. To constantly add new elements to a project that will in the long term keep the existing users and attract new ones. To create unique environment for potential sponsors based on the needs of the target group. To optimise costs and for promotion to use only our own media platforms if the portfolio provides sufficient reach, as in our case. (Small niche publishers can try to link up with larger media companies on a revenue-sharing principle in exchange for media space). Preparations for the next season have already begun. We will organise even more extra events, and the school can perhaps start to operate in other larger cities across the country. We are certain that new successes are coming!

    "DiffbotBody": "LONDON— Tom Hayes, the alleged mastermind of a global interest-rate-rigging conspiracy, said that he decided to fight charges against him after discovering in 2013 that his former employer, UBS AG, had what he called an “instruction manual” for manipulating rates. Mr. Hayes, who broke down in tears on the witness stand Friday, is accused by British prosecutors of eight counts of fraudulently trying to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. For several months in 2013, he cooperated with British prosecutors, admitting his guilt and planning to testify against his alleged co-conspirators. It was part of an attempt to avoid extradition to the U.S., which charged him with fraud and antitrust violations in December 2012. As part of his process of cooperating with British prosecutors, Mr. Hayes said he was shown an internal UBS spreadsheet that appeared to spell out exactly how the bank’s Libor submitters should skew rates to benefit their trading positions. Mr. Hayes said he was “flabbergasted” when he saw that document. “I read that document and it corroborated what I already knew.... It did give me some confidence that I can fight this.” He said it convinced him that UBS was guilty of “sheer hypocrisy” for singling him out as a ringleader when in fact the company appeared to condone skewing Libor for trading reasons. UBS has previously pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of Libor manipulation. Later in 2013, Mr. Hayes decided to stop cooperating with the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office and to fight the charges. Mr. Hayes, who has been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, is the first person to stand trial for allegedly manipulating Libor. He says that he is a scapegoat, that Libor-rigging was commonplace in the market and that his superiors at UBS and Citigroup Inc. C 2.10 % condoned his tactics. Part of his defense is that he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong and that he only admitted dishonesty and wrongdoing to the SFO in order to get charged in Britain and avoid extradition. On the stand Friday, asked by his lawyers to tell the jury why he initially cooperated with prosecutors, Mr. Hayes appeared to be overcome with emotion, bowing his head and welling up with tears, as he described his mental state in early 2013. “I knew what I thought and what I wanted to say, but I knew I couldn’t say it,” he said. “What I wanted to say is, ’I’ve not done anything, it was just my job, and I’m not dishonest.’” His wife, Sarah, sitting in the audience, also cried. The trial was briefly adjourned to allow Mr. Hayes time to compose himself. Friday was Mr. Hayes’s fourth day on the stand. Next week he will be cross-examined for the first time by prosecutors. A UBS spokeswoman declined to comment, citing English contempt-of-court rules.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project.

I don’t see them anymore,’” she said. By next year, Georgia is expected to be among the states adding numbers to the larger North American bat database — to help researchers sort out what’s happening to bats and why.",

The Heritage Council said it did not receive a referral from the WA Planning Commission nor did it make a submission, as the Vale development did not share a boundary with the state-registered Henry Bull's Cottage and did not have any physical impact on the cultural significance of the place. Mr Jacob did not respond. Since then, Echo News obtained a copy of the Western Australian Planning Commission's metropolitan region scheme amendment No. 1020/33 Egerton Estate, Ellenbrook dated August 2003. In it there is a late submission (dated November 21, 2001) by the Heritage Council to the WAPC secretary Paul Stephens. The submission, signed by then-director Ian Baxter, said that \"in conjunction with a reduction in the area of the proposed urban zone, a permanent buffer zone in the form of a parks and recreation reservation [should] be imposed between the proposed urban zone and Lot 106\". The submission also said \"Given the close proximity of Egerton Estate, Ellenbrook to a registered place, it is a concern that this matter was not referred to the Heritage Council by the WAPC prior to the closing of public submissions\". State Heritage Office executive director Graeme Gammie said Mr Baxter had provided comments on the amendment. Mr Gammie said there was no reference in the documentation for amendment No.1020/33 in 2001 to Stockland's Vale development. \"There was no subsequent referral to the Heritage Council in relation to the subdivision of the land, the form of development or the landscape and infrastructure that make up the Vale estate, which was recommended by the City of Swan and endorsed by the WAPC on November 26, 2013,\"he said. \"As part of his 2001 submission, Mr Baxter supported a recommendation by the Environmental Protection Agency, WAPC's eastern districts planning committee and the Swan Valley Planning Committee that in order to minimise the potential for any adverse impact on the Heritage Listed site at Lot 106 by the proposed MRS Amendment, a permanent buffer zone should be established between the proposed urban zone and Lot 106. \"We understand that there is now a designated conservation category wetlands site between the two areas.\" Henry Bull's Cottage owner Jerry Horgan said to the best of his knowledge there was no designated conservation category wetlands between the historic precinct and the new development. \"It is not listed on any of the title documents relating to our property,\" he said. \"On the other hand, it may refer to the land on the upstream side of the dam or they could be referring to the land downstream of the historic precinct. \"This is the open area along the Ellen Brook downstream of the convict bridge.\" Belhus Rural Protection Group spokeswoman Susan Hall said it was disappointing the Heritage Council's earlier submission had been ignored. Mrs Hall said the proposed urban zone had not been reduced and was now only metres from Cruse's flour mill, marri trees, which had been there when Europeans first arrived in the area, had been cut down and instead of a park and recreation reserve being installed that area had been treated as urban public open space and would be occupied by a drainage swale. Echo News Million Butshiire (right) in action during his days with the Perth Glory youth team. Photo: Paul Kane Former Perth Glory youth team players Million Butshiire and Lewis James Hall are among three men charged over more than $300,000 worth of alleged frauds across Australia, New Zealand and Africa. It will be alleged the two 23-year-olds and the other man, 26, were part of a syndicate that used stolen credit cards to buy concert and plane tickets, and also made false insurance claims. They were identified during a Major Fraud Squad investigation, which continues. Congo-born Mr Butshiire and Mr Hall, both of Currambine, are both due to face several fraud-related charges at Perth Magistrates Court on July 29. The 26-year-old, a Seville Grove man, faces one charge of causing a detriment by fraud and is due to face Perth Magistrates Court on December 8. Mr Butshiire played as a striker for the Perth Glory youth team from 2009 to 2010, before playing for a variety of Hungarian, French, Chinese and Australian teams for the past four years - including Altona Magic SC, Cockburn City SC, Bayswater SC and most recently Inglewood United. Mr Hall played as a defender for the Perth Glory youth team from 2008 to 2009.",

That and really I want to see some improvements, aside from the marketing fluff they keep pushing. Boot times are negligible for me, since I usually have to check something else. The whole forced update idea is silly at best, especially if updates are requiring a full system restart. Nope! Was using 7 since it was preview like 2008, don't recall really why, probably because had more than 3,5GB of RAM and XPx64 was hopeless. Neccesity really. I've tested out W10 for few hours and doesn't feel like different OS, just reorganised skin with some driver issues. I will probably wait for issues to get addressed, DX12 to get essential, tweaks and apps that imitate XP usability (Classic Explorer), maybe download W10 licence before expiry date, but if not essential still use Win7 (I hope license transfer like this will be possible, but probably M$ and modders will solve most issues before transfer expiry date). Really, the big stopper for me to test Preview was lack of drivers to test it properly on my spare machine. Anyone saying this hasn't been doing their research. Windows 10 is objectively better and faster than Windows 7 in every conceivable way. I will be upgrading on Day 1 - it's better and it's free forever, there is absolutely no reason not to. Just dive in and enjoy, and know that Windows 10 is going to be remembered as fondly as Windows 7 is now. If you don't upgrade, you are limiting yourself to slower boot times and overall performance (Windows 10 uses fewer resources than Windows 7, this is a fact), no DX12, no new file management tools, no Hyper-V, single workspace, etc. Clinging to the past and saying \"Well M$ f'd it up with Win 8 so I'm sticking with 7\" just makes you look stubborn and uninformed. Enjoy your slower, less fully-featured OS I guess.",
    "LabBody": "I'm certainly upgrading as soon as possible. But I also depend on Dell releasing drivers for my laptop model, so whether I can upgrade on day 1 depends on whether the drivers are already there.
