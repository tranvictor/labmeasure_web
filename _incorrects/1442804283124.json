Florida State is scheduled to play Oregon in the Rose Bowl NCAA college football playoff semifinal on New Year's Day. (AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) AP Published: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 8:32 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 8:32 p.m. TALLAHASSEE — Florida State indefinitely suspended leading running back Dalvin Cook after he was charged Friday with punching a woman outside a downtown bar — the second time in two weeks that an FSU player has been charged with punching a woman. The incident happened June 23 after the popular bar closed at 2 a.m. A witness told police a group of football players began arguing with the alleged victim after one suggested taking her home and having sex and she refused, saying she had a boyfriend. The woman, Madison Geohegan, told police that during the argument Florida State wide receiver Travis Rudolph came too close to her and she pushed him. At that point, Cook stepped in, asked her why she pushed Rudolph and began swinging at her, she told police. \"She did not know how many times she was struck, but she fell back against a black Jeep parked along the roadway,\" officer Jerritt Federico wrote in an affidavit. Cook was restrained by friends, but while held back punched Geohegan in the face, she told police. Police said she had swelling and a bleeding lip. She identified Cook through a photographic lineup. State Attorney Willie Meggs interviewed Geohegan and Cook before issuing the arrest warrant on a misdemeanor battery charge. Police are giving Cook the option of turning himself in. He denied striking the woman. Cook, 19, led Florida State last year with 1,008 rushing yards as a freshman. He was also second on the team with eight touchdowns. Cook rushed for 177 yards and a touchdown and caught five passes for 43 yards in Florida State's 37-35 victory over Georgia Tech to win the ACC championship. He also rushed for 103 yards in Florida State's 59-20 loss to Oregon in the Rose Bowl. Cook is 5-feet-11-inches tall and 200 pounds. Geohegan is 5-feet-4-inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, according to a police report. It's the second time in two weeks that an FSU player has been charged with punching a woman. Freshman quarterback De'Andre Johnson was caught on a surveillance video punching a woman at another bar near campus on June 24. He was suspended after being charged the next day and kicked off the team earlier this week when the video was made public. Johnson, however, had yet to play a game for Florida State, while Cook has been expected to be a key to the team's offense this year. \"We spend a good deal of time educating our student-athletes about appropriate behavior and their responsibilities as representatives of Florida State. The majority of our players are exemplary, but clearly we must place an even stronger emphasis on this,\" coach Jimbo Fisher said in a statement released by the school. \"I remain committed to educating our young men and holding them accountable for their actions,\" Fisher said. \"We will do better. I will not tolerate anything less.\" University President John Thrasher said he has asked Fisher and the school's athletics director to develop a plan to help the school's athlete's understand the consequences of their actions. \"This will include Coach Fisher meeting immediately with his team to reiterate, in no uncertain terms, our expectations of them. I also plan to meet with the team, and we will be asking professionals who deal with these matters, including State Attorney Willie Meggs, to speak with them,\" Thrasher said. It is unfortunate that the actions of a very few individuals are causing embarrassment to their teammates and this university.\" A phone number for Cook was not immediately available, and it was unclear if he has a lawyer.

Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

    "DiffbotBody": "News Local News Regional \u0026 National Health July 10th, 2015 9:35 pm by TRAVIS LOLLER, Associated Press John Jay Hooker, center, is greeted as he leaves the courtroom after his hearing on Friday, July 10, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. AP Photo/Mark Zaleski) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A former Democratic gubernatorial candidate who is terminally ill is asking a state court in Tennessee to declare he has a right to end his life when he wants and on his own terms. A lawyer for longtime civil rights activist and former Democratic candidate for governor John Jay Hooker argued Friday that the state has no legitimate interest in forcing a terminally ill person to undergo prolonged and painful death. Hooker, 84, has terminal cancer. Attorney Hal Hardin asked the Nashville-based court to declare that a person has a fundamental right to die with a doctor's help under the Tennessee Constitution. Hardin, who also represents the doctors who have expressed a willingness to prescribe Hooker a lethal dosage of painkillers, added that state law on the subject is contradictory and unconstitutionally vague. State law allows a person to refuse end-of-life care. It also allows a physician to prescribe drugs that hasten death, as long as the primary purpose of those drugs is to alleviate pain. That includes something called palliative sedation, which Hardin described as a doctor keeping a patient unconscious with morphine while he or she dies from lack of food and water. \"The family comes around for days or even weeks and watches this pitiful, sorrowful tragedy play out,\" Hardin said. Like physician-assisted suicide, a physician providing palliative sedation provides a patient with the means of death \"albeit in slow motion,\" he said. The state of Tennessee is asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit. The attorney representing the state, Steven Hart, argued that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled there is no fundamental right to assisted suicide and that states have a legitimate interest in preserving life. \"In this compelling state interest to preserve lives, we do not value different types of lives differently,\" Hart said. The life of a terminally ill person is \"just as valuable as that of a healthy 20-year-old.\" Hart argued that the state legislature or a public referendum, not the courtroom, are the proper forums for deciding a whether physicians should be allowed to provide lethal dosages of drugs to dying patients. Oregon and Washington both allow physician-assisted suicide, but that is part of a statutory and regulatory scheme, not a fundamental right, Hart said. Vermont also has a law allowing physician-assisted suicide, and in Montana the state Supreme Court has said it is not illegal, although there is no law specifically allowing it. Only one state court in New Mexico has ever found a fundamental right to assisted suicide, but that decision is currently under appeal, Hart said. Hooker is also behind an effort in the Tennessee General Assembly to pass legislation allowing assisted suicide. Hooker has fought for civil and constitutional rights for 60 years but says he believes this effort is the most important thing he has ever done. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, he said, \"It's just so morally right.\" comments powered by Disqus",

    "DiffbotBody": "If you are at Chicago's Midway Airport or on board a Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) flight in the days ahead, don't be surprised if you see a lot of smiling Southwest flight attendants in your midst. Midway is Southwest's largest hub, and home base for many of the carrier's flight attendants. Late last week, the executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, who represent more than 13,500 Southwest flight attendants altogether, voted to approve a tentative new contract, which over the next several weeks will be presented to the full membership to ratify. A spokesman for Local 556 today said the vote on the new contract should be completed by the end of July. If, as expected, the contract is approved by the full union membership, Southwest flight attendants would, according to Local 556 President and lead negotiator Audrey Stone, \"continue to be the highest paid in the (airline) industry through 2019.\" The new contract also would be retroactive to 2013 when negotiations began. A spokesman for Local 556 said the contract does include pay raises for flight attendants, who in turn would agree to work rule revisions in exchange for the higher pay. Full details of the tentative new collective bargaining agreement will be released soon, the Local said. Southwest's tentative new contract with its flight attendants, however, still leaves the low-fare behemoth without new contracts with three major units in its workforce — pilots, mechanics and ramp agents who handle baggage and other crucial plane servicing functions at the gate. Southwest flight attendants were in negotiations for two years on their new contract. But ramp agents, who are growing increasingly restless, have been without a new contract for some four years. A large group of ramp agents recently picketed Southwest's annual meeting, and ramp agents who were unhappy about the excruciatingly slow progress of contract talks are believed to have been a key factor in the historic Southwest Airlines meltdown at Midway Airport in early 2014 that left 16 Southwest planes filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. The recent picketing and other rumblings about labor unrest at Southwest may have prompted Southwest CEO Gary Kelly to speed up efforts to get new contracts with all of the various unions who comprise his airline's workforce. Any major concerns about possible employee strikes could cause Southwest customers to consider booking flights with competitors instead.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Americans typically celebrate the Fourth of July with family, friends, fireworks, food, and flags. But alas, some people are incapable of swinging with the holiday spirit. Advertisement I’m referring, of course, to the Obama haters. They never take a day off, and they’re constantly off their meds. Their latest freakout occurred last weekend, when the president voiced cheery remarks about Independence Day. Granted, Obama did laud the military (“we are so grateful for their service and for their sacrifice”), he plucked the chords of patriotism (“we honor everyone who continually strives to make this country a better, stronger, more inclusive, and more hopeful place”), and he praised the Founding Fathers (“this is the day when, 239 years ago, our founding patriots declared our independence, proclaiming that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”). But the haters’ heads exploded anyway. Why? Because he didn’t say the word “God.” The right-wing Washington Examiner announced, “Obama omits ‘God’ from Fourth of July address.” An Examiner reader duly tweeted, “Obama omits ‘God’ from Fourth of July address Obama is a secular Muslim with communist leaning.” Elsewhere, the right-wing Infowars website announced, “Obama leaves out ‘God’ from 4th of July weekly address.” An Infowars reader duly tweeted, “Closet Muslim leaves out ‘God’ from 4th of July weekly address.” Others duly re-tweeted and contributed their own scholarship, such as, “The godless little man — Is anyone surprised?” and “This proves he is a muslim” and “Devil only mentions God when damning him.” I could go on. The right-wing Gateway Pundit blog opined, “Who the man is, and what he truly stands for, is beginning to seep out” and a blogger at BizPac Review lamented, “He may as well have said, ‘Tell all your friends you love Obamacare’....I’m beginning to think he does things like this just to tick people off.” But that’s enough troll bilge for one day. Perhaps a few hundred sessions of anger management would help school these people in the benefits of rational thought. The word “Creator,” which Obama referenced in his holiday address, is listed in the dictionary as a synonym for “God.” And last time I checked, Obama concludes virtually every formal address, including the State of the Union, with variations of “may God bless the United States of America.” In fact, Obama recently delivered a formal address in Charleston, eulogizing nine victims of racist domestic terrorism, and if my ears were functioning correctly, I could’ve sworn that I heard him say the G-word. Like, for instance: “Giving all praise and honor to God....Blinded by hatred, (the terrorist) failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood — the power of God’s grace....According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It’s not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God....May God continue to shed His Grace on the United States of America.” Any anger-management candidate with a keyboard can search the transcript and discover that Obama mentioned “God” 17 times. By the way, if the haters have truly convinced themselves that Obama is God-lite, they might want to extend their ire to Thomas Jefferson — because our Fourth of July author was notoriously indifferent about religion in general. For instance, we have this passage he wrote in 1782: “It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty Gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket or breaks my leg.” And this letter he wrote in 1813: “History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance...” And this letter in 1820: “Priests...dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight.” Heck, when he ran for president in 1800, his opponents warned that if he won, he would shutter all the churches. The Fourth of July is a secular holiday and Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence is a secular document. But if the haters prefer to stay fixated on Obama’s G-word omission, perhaps they should play his remarks backward and listen carefully for coded praise of Allah. The task could take a while, but these people seem to have the time. Dick Polman is the national political columnist at NewsWorks/WHYY in Philadelphia. Email him at dickpolman7@gmail.com.",

    "DiffbotBody": "When Phil DeGuzman's private student loans were sold to a new lender, he felt powerless. \"I found out about it via email,\" says DeGuzman, who was in graduate school at DePaul University in Chicago at the time. \"The process was smooth because I had no choice but to accept it.\" Now, he makes payments to two private lenders, which isn't ideal, says DeGuzman. \"I would prefer that everything transfer\" to one company, he says. DeGuzman's experience isn't uncommon. Both private and federal loan servicers may transfer a borrower's debt to another company, sometimes leaving customers scratching their heads over what inspired the shift – and what it means for payments going forward. But while the transfer process may feel like a pain, it doesn't have to be costly for borrowers. Here's what debtors can do to stay on top of their student loan payments before, after and during a shift in servicers. 1. Understand why: The changeover can happen for a range of reasons, experts say. A student who opts to enroll in Public Service Loan Forgiveness, for example, may find their loans transferred to FedLoan Servicing, which handles loans on that repayment plan. One loan may change hands so that all the borrower's debt is handled by one company. A transfer may also occur after a company sells its loan portfolio. [Discover how to cope with a change in student loan servicers.] 2. Keep an eye on paperwork: Student loan borrowers \"need to keep up with what's being sent to them,\" says Terry Finney, director of financial aid and scholarships at Arkansas State University. When a federal loan is transferred, borrowers may receive an email or letter from their old servicer as well as a welcome letter after their information transfers to the new system, says the Department of Education's website. During a recent servicer transition, Navient, the federal loan arm of Sallie Mae, contacted borrowers about four months ahead of the changeover, says Patricia Nash Christel, a spokeswoman for Navient. Early messages were co-branded by both the outgoing and incoming servicers to smooth the transition, she says. If debtors aren't sure which servicer – or servicers – are handling their loans, they can head to the National Student Loan Data System to take stock of their overall federal loan debt, says Marty Somero, director of financial aid at the University of Northern Colorado. For private debt, checking their credit report can help reveal what they've borrowed, says Somero. 3. Update payment methods: Inputting correct information into a new system right away is key to avoid issues resulting in unprocessed or late payments. \"It's a good idea to go ahead and set up a login with your new servicer,\" says Finney. Missing payments can end in late fees and even start the clock ticking toward default. During a servicing transfer, some borrowers have reported interruptions receiving billing statements and other important messages, according to a 2013 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Others were unaware of subtle policy differences between one servicer and another. For example, the old servicer may have allowed them to pay their loans through a credit card while the new one required direct transfers from a bank account. Borrowers using automatic debit to repay their loans with a previous servicer should check whether their payment information transferred – it may need to be re-entered into the new servicer's online system, says Finney. 4. Complain – if you must: If a new lender isn't responsive, students can head to an official bureau, such as the CFPB, to lodge a formal complaint. [Discover five steps to file a student loan complaint.] Another resource for borrowers is the financial aid office of their alma mater, says Finney. The office may have access to a representative from the loan servicing company who's more helpful or accessible than the call center employees manning the main phone lines, he says. 5. Consider refinancing: If the new servicer isn't cutting it, borrowers can look into refinancing their debt, says Somero, of Northern Colorado. The process of refinancing involves paying off an existing debt by taking on a new loan, with new terms. [Know the risks and rewards of private student loan refinancing.] But think twice – or three times – before refinancing federal debt into a private loan since those borrowers lose federal benefits and protections. Choosing a new lender carefully is important or else \"you're going from the griddle to the frying pan,\" says Somero. Trying to fund your education?

    "DiffbotBody": "The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. \"Brown Sugar\" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, \"all the nasty subjects in one go\"). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R\u0026B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of \"Wild Horses\" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of \"Dead Flowers\" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (\"You Gotta Move\") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R\u0026B of \"I Got the Blues\" to the crunchy boogie of \"Bitch\" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on \"Dead Flowers\" is obviously played for laughs, but \"You Gotta Move\" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. \"I Got the Blues\" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. \"Sister Morphine\" and \"Moonlight Mile\" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of \"Brown Sugar\" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on \"Miami Vice\" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.",

The budget includes a three-percent, or $1,625, increase to the pay schedule for teachers, librarians and nurses. This would give first-year teachers a minimum salary of $50,000 and those with 25-plus years experience $61,438. The recommendation also calls for an equity adjustment for teachers with 10 or more years of experience. “At the July meeting, I want to bring that forward as a recommendation for the Board to consider approval so all of our employees know so they can plan accordingly,” Stockton said. In addition to those increases, they also plan adjustments to special education aides, increasing the bilingual stipend to market value and auxiliary adjustments to pay grade one and others.

Moreover, the district already expects to hire an additional lead nurse, 3.5 instructional support employees, an additional human resources employee, an additional behavior support special education employee, four additional technology support staff, and 19 auxiliary staff members.

    "DiffbotBody": "Growing up in Turkey in the 1990s, the whole live music scene was dominated by cover bands that played hits from the United States and Europe. It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. But when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was. So I went back and listened to them—and was blown away. Listen to a playlist featuring Turkish artists covered in this story: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the music scene in Turkey flourished, producing local legends including Erkin Koray and Selda Bağcan. But a military coup in 1980 put a definite hold on the arts. There was not much happening besides pop music for a while, but a strong metal scene appeared in the ‘90s, including bands which formed the base for long running acts like Replikas, Nekropsi, and Daire 2: General Gramafon. The Internet then spurred on a new wave of vibrancy within the country's music scene, and underground musicians started to embrace their own roots and write their lyrics in Turkish. Peyote, a music venue located in the heart of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, became the first venue to exclusively book bands with original music, giving way to a healthy artistic community. Musicians in Turkey still face drawbacks on a daily basis: There are still only a handful of venues that host non-cover bands, with bigger venues only booking foreign acts (and not offering local groups support slots), and lots of music festivals have been cancelled due to new government regulations that prevent alcohol sponsorships. But these obstacles have brought bands together as they collectively work to book shows, open DIY venues, and do their own street festivals. Members of Istanbul’s music scene outside Roxy, one of the city's oldest venues for rock shows There are only a few cities in Turkey with music venues, and getting visas to play shows in Europe can be difficult, so touring is not really an option for most underground bands. But the economic inviability of making a living entirely from music—as well as the diminished chances of any type of rock stardom—has effectively eliminated certain types of musicians, leaving behind only the ones who are 100% dedicated to what they do. Right now, despite all the roadblocks in the way, there is an incredibly lively DIY music scene in Turkey, filled with talented musicians. I asked nearly 20 of these artists to take me where they feel at home in Istanbul and talked to them about the current state of the music scene. The journey led me through rehearsal spaces and tea gardens, alleyways and festive feasts.",

Services: Rosary from 7 to 8 p.m. July 19; Mass at 10:30 a.m. July 20, followed by a celebration of life, all at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, 600 Oblate Drive. Of her many accomplishments in life — becoming a real estate agent after she and her husband divorced in midlife, extensive volunteerism, and her service as a Navy WAVE during World War II — the most important to Elizabeth Ruth Dielmann “Betty” Breen was her 11 children. Teaching each of them that doing for others was “the way to live life,” Breen, a devout Catholic, led by example. “To us success is how much you have affected another; it’s the foundation of what you do.” Breen died June 30 at 90. Born just a few years before the start of the Great Depression, in 1924, she was adopted by Ivetta and Henry Dielmann when her birth family was unable to support her. Henry Dielmann, an assistant city attorney who served in the Texas House of Representatives for three terms, also was the first dean of St. Mary’s University Law School. “She thought the sun rose and set on her father,” Breen’s daughter Cathy Mellgren said. Educated in Catholic schools, Breen graduated from St. Mary’s High School in 1941, enrolling at what was then Our Lady of the Lake College before withdrawing at the start of World War II to work for the Bell system as a telephone operator. As her brothers and friends went off to war, Breen decided to join the Navy, becoming a WAVE, or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, serving at Alameda Naval Air Station in California after training in government communications at the Pentagon. Returning to San Antonio after her discharge, Breen again enrolled at Our Lady of the Lake before marrying her high school sweetheart in 1947. After living in College Station as her husband finished college at Texas A\u0026M University, the family returned to San Antonio, settling on the near North Side. As her family grew, Breen rose to the challenge of getting by on a limited budget. “My dad gave her $40 a week” for groceries, Mellgren said. “She bought in bulk before Sam’s ever existed.” As Breen’s oldest daughter, Mellgren has vivid memories of helping her mother with her youngest siblings, twin sisters. “The … washer, it seemed like it ran 24 hours a day,” Mellgren said. “There were no disposable diapers, they were all cloth, cotton diapers; the bed was piled high with all these diapers she had to fold.” As busy as she was, Breen still made time for volunteer work, guiding her children through the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and raising funds for Blessed Sacrament Parish, Providence and Central Catholic high schools and Our Lady of the Lake University. Breen also chaired the Assumption Seminary Polo Fest for many years. “Betty always made her famous egg rolls,” her friend Barbara Klauer said. “She toiled many nights and froze them in advance … donated everything, and her kids and friends helped fry them and sell them at the festival.” Sometimes, if Breen had another commitment, her children would step in to help. “It would take six of us to do what my mom would do, and we would be exhausted,” her daughter Ann Callahan said. “The weekend she fractured her hip, it about killed all of us.” Breen continued helping others after becoming a real estate agent in 1981, at the age of 60. “She loved it, helping people find homes,” Mellgren said. Sometimes “they could barely afford housing, but she would get them qualified, even loan them the money for the closing costs.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Being a personal assistant can be a humbling experience. While there are certainly pros to a job that immerses you in the lives of the rich and powerful, it can also reveal the ugly side of humanity. Assistants see everything — from their employer’s daily schedule to their most intimate moments. It can feel like a roller coaster, with a boss acting like a demon from hell one minute and gifting their assistant an expensive bag the next. Bosses everywhere have their quirks, but a town like Los Angeles — with its abundance of celebrities and moguls — can breed a particularly terrifying species. Being an assistant might as well earn you a degree in the psychology of human behavior. And while some former assistants would prefer to leave their traumatizing employment experience in the past, there are the ones who have felt scorned enough to write a juicy memoir. Read on for seven scary stories from former assistants with bosses from hell, from a germaphobe actress to a Miranda Priestly wannabe. If you’ve ever been the assistant to an eccentric executive or crazy celebrity, find comfort in knowing that you’re not alone.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The attorney for the parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, said the decision not to prosecute the veteran sergeant seemed “preordained.” Mawuli Davis, the Thomases’ layer, said the investigation into the March 24 shooting was tightly controlled from start to finish by Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds, who presented his findings Thursday to a grand jury that concluded Sgt. Kenneth Owens’ use of deadly force was justified. “There has not been a level of transparency,” as Reynolds promised, Davis said. Felicia Thomas, mother of Nicholas Thomas, speaks as her son Triston “TJ” Thomas comforts her during a press conference at Davis Bozeman Law Firm in Decatur on Friday. The parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, felt “disrespected and discouraged” by the process that culminated Thursday with a grand jury’s recommendation not to prosecute the veteran sergeant, the family’s lawyer said. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM Nicholas Thomas’ mother said she learned Owens would not face charges on television, “the same way I found out my son was” killed. Davis blasted the Cobb D.A. for meeting with the media Thursday before reaching out to his clients. “Rather than have a private meeting with the family, they had a private meeting with the media,” said Davis, adding the Thomases felt “disrespected” by Reynolds. Felicia Thomas, mother of Nicholas Thomas, speaks as her son Triston “TJ” Thomas comforts her during a press conference at Davis Bozeman Law Firm in Decatur on Friday. The parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, felt “disrespected and discouraged” by the process that culminated Thursday with a grand jury’s recommendation not to prosecute the veteran sergeant, the family’s lawyer said. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM “This is an absolute effort to control messaging,” he said. And the message delivered to reporters was not altogether factual, said Davis, noting that a press release announcing the grand jury’s decision stated that Smyrna and Cobb police “attempted to arrest Mr. Thomas on a felony probation violation warrant.” Thomas was actually being sought for a probation violation stemming from a conviction on a misdemeanor charge of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana. Davis said he is eager to find out what evidence was presented to the grand jury. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has submitted an open-records request and was informed it would receive the entire case file sometime next week. Of particular interest will be any information explaining why Owens felt compelled to shoot. Of the five officers dispatched to the Cumberland Parkway Goodyear, where Thomas worked, Owens was the only one to draw his gun. Thomas tried to elude the officers, jumping into a customer’s Maserati, a detail neither side disputes. With the only exit blocked by police, Thomas drove around the building twice. Owens told investigators he shot at the Maserati because he feared Thomas was going to run over an officer who was behind him. It’s a different narrative than the one provided immediately after the shooting, when Smyrna police told reporters Owens shot at Thomas to save himself. Davis said it’s no coincidence Owens’ story changed after it was revealed the fatal bullet entered through Thomas’ back. Co-counsel Rob Bozeman said he wants to know whether that other officer feared for his safety and, if so, why he didn’t feel the need to draw his gun. “It seems obvious that officer could’ve defended his own life,” Bozeman said. The Thomases’ lawyers said they have notified Smyrna police and Owens of their intent to file civil litigation. Felicia Thomas said she will continue to pursue justice for her son, who left behind a young daughter. “God has the last word, not Vic Reynolds,” she said.",

In January, the OSBI shared a crucial piece of evidence with the public, hoping it would spawn new leads pointing to the killer. They released a cable ticket book found inside Tracey’s home. The last ticket in the book is for work on her cable before noon the morning she was killed. At the time, the OSBI hadn’t been able to figure out which cable company went out to Tracey’s home. After dozens of tips, investigators say they have learned the ticket book belonged to a Southwestern Bell employee. Authorities are also searching for a keyring that was taken from the crime scene.

The highs of EastEnders favourite Jean Slater's return also brought several lows, especially for Stacey as they soon fought over THAT key. Meanwhile, Lee Carter was having problems of his own. His mental health problems are slowly beginning to play out in another dark Carter storyline, which will hopefully see Lee get better over time. The actor himself, Danny-Boy Hatchard, said: \"It’s something that at some point most people in their lives will experience on different levels” There have been many questions asked this week, tweet us @MirrorTV to let us know yours. What will Jean do with THAT key she hid from Stacey? Jean's emotional return was rocked by the Walford favourite noticing THAT key. Stacey is determined to find out what it opens and she told Martin: \"I don't know but I'm going to find out.\" Is Sean Slater Kat's son? When Sean left Stacey he told her to look after the special key - which belonged to her dad Brian, but what does it open? We took a few guesses earlier in the week. When is Dean Gaffney aka Robbie Jackson coming back? Will Tamwar ever be happy? There have been glimpses but we're not so sure. Where was Lee going during that Tube Strike? #ThatAwkwardMoment when you film a tube station scene weeks in advance and then there's a #TubeStrike! #EastEnders pic.twitter.com/pWPUrHvknZ— BBC EastEnders (@bbceastenders) July 9, 2015. Who will help Lee Carter? It will be an emotional ride for Mick's boy. We hope he gets better soon. Why does Pearl smell so much? There is no other baby in soap history that is given such a bad rep for having a stinky nappy. Why don't writers leave that little bubba alone? How will Stacey cope with her pregnancy? In tonight’s episode Nancy tries to get to the bottom of Lee's problems once and for all. She is very pleased when her brother finally agrees to see the doctor - although he insists she keep the appointment a secret from their Mick and Linda. Meanwhile, an emotional Kim runs over one of Les' wreaths, so Vincent tries to make amends by inviting the Cokers to a Hubbard family meal. How will Paul feel about making small talk over the dinner table with his grandfather and Claudette? * EastEnders concludes this week at 8pm on BBC One",

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Wilmington designer Meg Caswell cites a number of details that make the entryway to Martha Jung's home on Hydrangea Place in the city's Forest Hils neighborhood one of her favorite in town. Photo by Paul Stephen Published: Saturday, July 11, 2015 at 12:30 a.m. Last Modified: Thursday, June 18, 2015 at 8:46 a.m. Curb appeal doesn’t have to end at the street. The addition of a graceful walkway, some clever landscaping and a rocking chair to your home can create a magnetic pull no visitor will resist. Meg Caswell, host of the former HGTV show “Meg’s Great Rooms,” has recently opened the design shop Fifth \u0026 Castle in Wilmington. A noted interior designer from Chicago, Caswell has fallen for many of the Port City’s graceful entryways, but singles out the home of a client on Hydrangea Place in the Forest Hills neighborhood among her favorites. “You feel like you’re being hugged by that entrance,” Caswell said. “It’s opening its arms for you to walk in.” For anyone looking to refresh their own thresholds, we asked Caswell to break down the entryway’s many features into a few key points that can translate to many year-round homes. Walk this way: Caswell likes the mixed media pathway combining brickwork and decorative concrete. The effect makes the long walk to the door all the more interesting. Plant power: A low line of liriope (better known as monkey grass) yields to a variety of knee-high vegetation, all towered over by a thatch of lilies. The effect creates multiple layers of interest and invitation, Caswell said. An overarching achievement: Any number of plants can be trained to envelop a doorway. In this case, vining jasmine both looks lovely and leaves an unmistakable perfume hanging over the door. Consider ivy for a timeless look, or a flowering vine like coral honeysuckle if attracting hummingbirds is just as important as drawing in human visitors. Offset attraction: Caswell said the single porch light set to the right serves to punctuate the entryway’s powerful symmetry. A similar effect can be achieved with a particularly showy mailbox or dramatic planter. Leading lines: Brickwork just outside the door features sharply contrasting mortar, creating a visual funnel leading the eye inside. Tasteful restraint: Brightly painted doors are quite popular and Caswell says they have a time and place. But the mellow natural tones of the door make a more powerful statement, Caswell said. “There’s so much texture and contrast here,” Caswell said. “If they also had a colorfully painted door it would be too much.” Shine a light: The home features two pedestals on either side of the doorway. Depending on the event or season, they swap out colorful planters for glowing lanterns that cast a gentle illumination for guests visiting in the evening. Stay in shape: The landscaping, jasmine archway and walkway all serve to accentuate the architectural peak over the doorway, creating a triangular area of interest around the door. To seat or not to seat: Many homes in the South feature a rocking chair or swing by the door, but the landscaping around this particular home makes seating unnecessary, Caswell said. “If you don’t have the type of landscaping that hugs you, adding seating creates the same sense of welcome.” Contact Paul Stephen at 910-343-2041 or Paul.Stephen@StarNewsOnline.com Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

    "DiffbotBody": "Park City controls important properties along the lower Park Avenue corridor, including a site that once housed a fire station and the field outside the Park City Library and Education Center. A design studio scheduled next week involving architects, planners and developers will consider ideas for the properties. Courtesy of Park City Municipal Corp. City Hall plans to gather a team of architects, planners and developers next week in Park City to consider ideas for a patchwork of municipal properties along lower Park Avenue. The design studio will be another step as leaders continue to craft plans for what is anticipated to be a corridor that will offer restricted housing and broader community uses. A 10-person team mostly made of people from Park City and the Salt Lake Valley will participate in the design studio. They will start the work on Monday and continue through Thursday. A presentation to Mayor Jack Thomas and the Park City Council is scheduled on Thursday. The presentation is expected to cover options for the municipal properties and will likely include opportunities for affordable housing or housing that is otherwise deemed attainable. Phyllis Robinson, the community and public affairs manager at City Hall, said ideas could also involve a center for not-for-profit organizations, a senior citizens center and a childcare facility. She acknowledged, though, that Park City officials will eventually need to decide how the municipal properties will be used. If a not-for-profit center is developed, would there be other space available for housing, Robinson said as she described the choices leaders will eventually make. \"What is our next step . . . What are the other things we need to be thinking about,\" Robinson said. City Hall controls a series of properties along lower Park Avenue or just off the street. Leaders want to craft an overall plan for the corridor in an effort to improve an important route between Old Town and the Park City Mountain Resort area. Some of the properties include a former fire station on Park Avenue and a house next door as well as the Park City Senior Center on Woodside Avenue and land next door. The discussions also involve the field outside the Park City Library and Education Center, Miners Hospital and the recreation building at City Park. Park City is providing a stipend of $1,500 per person for a cost of $15,000 for the design studio. A public event is scheduled from 5:30 p.m. until 7 p.m. on Monday in the community room upstairs at the Library and Education Center. The team will provide public briefings at 4 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday at the library followed by a Thursday presentation to the elected officials, also at the library.

    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

Have a suggestion for a dish you'd like us to try? Leave it in the comments section or email lauren.saria@newtimes.com. 58. The Straw at Miracle Mile Deli When it comes to New York-style deli fare in the middle of the dessert, Miracle Mile Deli is about as good as you can do. For generations, this has been a family-run operation serving brisket of beef, corned beef, and matzoh ball soup. This year, the restaurant moved to a new freestanding location on 16th Street — and it serves beer and wine. It's truly a new age for this Valley landmark restaurant. You will experience a food coma if you eat this sandwich, so consider yourself warned. Which isn't to say you should let the prospect of sleeping away the afternoon deter you from ordering the Straw. This sandwich is piled high with pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut, not a particularly original combination, but satisfying nonetheless. You'll get your choice of breads, and the best option is to get your sandwich served on a hearty onion roll that will actually soak up all the juices from the meat and kraut.

Have a suggestion for a dish you'd like us to try? Leave it in the comments section or email lauren.saria@newtimes.com. 58. The Straw at Miracle Mile Deli. When it comes to New York-style deli fare in the middle of the dessert, Miracle Mile Deli is about as good as you can do. For generations, this has been a family-run operation serving brisket of beef, corned beef, and matzoh ball soup. This year, the restaurant moved to a new freestanding location on 16th Street — and it serves beer and wine. It's truly a new age for this Valley landmark restaurant. You will. experience a food coma if you eat this sandwich, so consider yourself warned. Which isn't to say you should let the prospect of sleeping away the afternoon deter you from ordering the Straw. This sandwich is piled high with pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut, not a particularly original combination, but satisfying nonetheless. You'll get your choice of breads, and the best option is to get your sandwich served on a hearty onion roll that will actually soak up all the juices from the meat and kraut. For a side, you'll get a kosher dill pickle, of course, and you'll have a choice to stick with the customary offering (French fries) or upgrade to something else.

    "DiffbotBody": "Scientists have figured out how to separate the pain relieving qualities of medical marijuana from its psychological side-effects in an effort to offer people a new high-free option. The research focussed on the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, known as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is not only responsible for the high associated with the drug - plus hallucinations, delusions, memory loss, and feelings of anxiety or calm - it’s also been shown to slow tumour growth in mice. And now, scientists have figured out that the mechanisms by which the drug delivers its desired medical effects and negative psychological effects work independently from one another - which means that one can be switched off while the other one works its magic. \"There has been a great deal of medical interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms at work in THC, so that the beneficial effects can be harnessed without the side-effects,\" one of the team, Peter McCormick from the University of East Anglia in the UK said in press release. \"THC acts through a family of cell receptors called cannabinoid receptors. Our previous research revealed which of these receptors are responsible for the anti-tumour effects of THC. This new research demonstrates how some of the drug's beneficial effects can be separated from its unwanted side effects.\" When investigating how THC is able to shrink tumours, the researchers figured out that negative psychological side-effects of the drug, such as memory defects, mood swings, anxiety, and paranoia, were triggered by a single pathway in the brain that was separate from the pathway that triggers the drug’s cancer-killing properties. In an effort to better understand the drug’s ability to cause these negative effects, the team isolated this particular pathway and experimented on it in mice. They noticed that two types of cell receptors were present in this pathway - the cannabinoid receptor and the serotonin receptor - and these happened to be positioned very close together, which suggested that the drug was acting on both at the same time. To figure out what effect this was having, the team blocked the activity of a specific type of serotonin receptor - called 5HT2AR - in the brains of mice, and gave them a dose of pure THC. The mice were then put through memory, behaviour, pain, and motor skills tests. \"These animals, lacking the serotonin receptor, showed differences only in the memory and mood tests - not in the pain tests,\" McCormick told Liat Clark at Wired. \"There were no side effects in memory, and that's exactly what we were looking for.\" Reporting the results in PLOS Biology, the team says with 5HT2AR turned off in mice, the THC was still able to reduce pain as well as tumour growth, but without the negative psychological effects. What they want to do now is figure out if the same mechanisms are in play in human brains, and then see if they can mimic the same serotonin receptor-blocking effect they achieved in the mice. McCormick calls this effect a \"Chinese wall\" that sits between the serotonin and cannabinoid receptors, and thinks it could be the key to medical marijuana without the negative side effects. \"For me, the ideal drug would be in one of two scenarios: a drug that does not recognise the THC cannabinoid receptor when near serotonin, or alternatively a drug you could add with THC that would provide that Chinese wall between the two,\" he told Wired.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Classical Mystery Tour, a Beatles tribute band, performs with the Pasadena Symphony and POPS on Saturday at the Los Angeles Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia. (Photo courtesy of the Pasadena Symphony and POPS / July 7, 2015) For many would-be musicians growing up in the ’60s, seeing the Beatles live on “The Ed Sullivan Show” as a child was like being hit by a bolt of lightning. It changed their lives and inspired many to pick up a guitar. Jim Owen, the 48-year-old Huntington Beach native who plays John Lennon in the Beatles tribute act Classical Mystery Tour was too young for that. Instead, his life-altering musical moment came in 1978, when he was 12 and saw “Beatlemania” at the Shubert Theatre in Century City. “They went that extra step in the Broadway show where they dressed in costume, had costume changes and portrayed all the various eras of the Beatles,” he says. “What was great about the show is that it was exactly what I wanted to do — have four guys in the group who would play the instruments live, sing live and recreate and not rearrange it, and be as authentic as possible.” The culmination of that dream is Classical Mystery Tour, a high-concept tribute show with a central idea: what if the Fab Four hadn’t stopped performing live in 1966 and took its more complex, strings-laden music to the concert stage, backed by a full orchestra. The ensemble’s performance Saturday at the Los Angeles Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia coincides the same night with another performance by the Fab Four at Burbank’s Starlight Bowl. “We love the music of the Beatles and try to give their songs the precise attention to detail that they deserve,” says the Fab Four’s Ron McNeil, who plays John Lennon. “When our fans come to our shows, we want them to think they’re seeing the real thing.” For Owen, by age 11 he was already playing Beatles covers in a group with some school chums. When the guitarist and bassist in that early nameless combo wanted to move onto Led Zeppelin, Owen and his Ringo-loving drummer had no interest in making a change. For them, it was Beatles or nothing. At 18, Owen landed a gig in the international production of “Beatlemania,” which toured Japan, Korea, China, Canada, Mexico and parts of South America. With that experience under his belt, in 1996, he launched Classical Mystery Tour. It was the perfect musical concept for Owen. Before he discovered the Beatles at age 7, he was raised on a steady diet of classical music and studied piano. “I think that’s how this really came together years down the road,” he says. “My love for the Beatles combined with my really strong classical background from early childhood.” Although Owen’s been playing Lennon in the show for more than 15 years, when the group first started in 1996, he had the role of George Harrison. “As a child learning guitar I didn’t think about singing, I just learned the George Harrison guitar parts that sounded so great on the records. That’s what I wanted to do. Later as a teenager, I realized I had to sing those songs, and I really enjoyed singing the George Harrison vocals — ‘Something’ and ‘Here Comes the Sun.’” However, after a few years in the Classical Mystery Tour, Owen began to take note of some of the feedback from fans. “People would come up to me and say you look more like John Lennon, you should be John Lennon,” he recalls. “So, I finally thought I should give it a try and I’m really glad I did, because I really enjoy the John Lennon part now.” Owen is joined in this incarnation of the Classical Mystery Tour by Tucson, Ariz., native Tony Kishman, who spent six years in the national and international cast of “Beatlemania” as Paul McCartney. “He’s the most convincing Paul McCartney tribute artist there is,” Owen says. Asked if Kishman plays bass left-handed like McCartney, Owen quips, “He sings left-handed,” adding that Kishman is so good, you’ll soon forget he isn’t holding his bass exactly like the icon he’s emulating. In the role of Ringo Starr is Chris Camilleri, who has been with the band since 1999 and has toured with such Beatles peers as Peter Noone of Herman’s Hermits, Badfinger and Micky Dolenz of the Monkees. David John usually fills the role of George Harrison, but he’s unable to play the show this Saturday, so Joe Bithorn — another alumni from the “Beatlemania” cast who’s also played in the tribute band Rain — will fill in. The set-list for Classical Musical Tour came naturally, as Owen explains Beatles’ classics such as “Yesterday,” “Eleanor Rigby,” “The Long and Winding Road,” and his personal favorite to perform, “A Day in the Life,” fit nicely with orchestrated backing. The format doesn’t necessarily work with the Beatles’ earliest material, so after its first few gigs, the band added a portion of the show without the orchestra, so it could touch on all the different eras of the Beatles. Of course, there have always been plenty other Beatles tributes. Aside from the Saturday shows by Classical Mystery Tour and the Fab Four, there is an Oct. 17 concert by the Fab Faux, a Beatles tribute led by late-night TV musicians sans Beatle-costumes, who will play the set-lists of the Beatles’ Hollywood Bowl and Dodger Stadium shows at the Valley Performing Arts Center at Cal State Northridge. So what sets the Classical Mystery Tour apart from the rest of the Beatles tribute pack? It’s not just an orchestra performing Beatles songs and not just another Beatles tribute band, but “an authentic recreation of what it would have been like if the Beatles played live backed by a live orchestra,” Owen says, adding. “It’s the concert they never gave themselves...and we’re really happy to still be doing it after all these years.” -- What: Classical Mystery Tour with the Pasadena Symphony and Pops Where: Los Angeles Arboretum and Botanic Garden, 301 N.

    "DiffbotBody": "The trio of brothers running Sunshine Market in Lynnwood, at the corner of 212th Street SW and 44th Avenue W, are serious about their fruits and vegetables.They stand behind their products, support local farmers and try to be there for their customers nearly every day of the year, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and until 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, said Noor Almtowaq, 29. And they'll stay open later if a customer drives in at closing time, he said.He's the eldest brother and the driving force behind the purchase of the stand, which they opened in September 2013.“Noor's the heart of the entire business,” said 26-year-old Alex.Yet Noor now works at Microsoft, finding time mainly on weekends and some nights for Sunshine Market, and it's Alex who's hooked on produce.“He has so much passion for the business,” said younger brother Josh, 22. “It's like he fell in love with produce.”Alex agreed and said he's not likely to fall out of love anytime soon either. In fact, he's searching for a site for a second, bigger store where he can expand the selection. He dreams of a string of stores offering both conventional and organic produce. He said there's a science to understanding how fruits and vegetables work — “for example, potatoes hate light, bananas love heat, asparagus loves water” — and in understanding how to sell produce.“When you put tomatoes, basil, eggplants and ginger next to each other,” he said, “it's a guarantee you're going to sell them all.”He's always been interested in how things work. Younger brother Josh said Alex was the kind of kid who was forever taking things apart and putting them back together. He studied at Edmonds Community College and earned an engineering degree from the University of Washington, because he wanted to understand the technology behind materials like concrete.“I'm an inventor and my imagination was limited because I didn't understand the materials, so it limited me,” Alex said. Understanding materials “grew my imagination,” he said.The brothers didn't start out planning to go into the produce business.“I didn't even know what cilantro was, to be honest,” Josh said.Prodded by Noor, they were just looking for a business. And they liked the Lynnwood location. Perched on a hilltop at a busy intersection with three corners anchored in Mountlake Terrace, the site overlooks a Lynnwood business district and streets leading to the Alderwood Mall and I-5. It's housed a produce stand at various times in the past, as well as a coffee stand, sometimes both at once. But there were few, if any, improvements to the building and nothing seemed to last for long. That changed when the Almtowaq brothers took over the site. It was Alex who almost singlehandedly rebuilt the building, doing everything the city would let him do by himself. He redid the electrical and plumbing, built the shelves and an awning for shade. He installed new siding and garage doors that can slide up to open an entire side of the building. “He built this whole entire building all by himself,” Josh said. “He's really smart. I used to come down and watch him.”Todd Hall, planning manager for the City of Lynnwood community development, said the brothers made “significant modifications” to the building and their business is apparently running smoothly.“Since they've come in, we haven't had any complaints or anything,” Hall said. “It seems to be going really well.”The brothers said they made a lot of mistakes and their first customers didn't expect Sunshine Market to last long.At first, they didn't have proper coolers and their produce wasn't being sprayed with water to keep it fresh. So Alex installed coolers and bought the software for a state-of-the-art sprinkler system. “My spinach now lasts two weeks,” he said. “I won't leave it in the store two weeks, but it lasts two weeks. When I first opened, I couldn't even get it to last three days.”Customer Kainitra Crammer, who lives in Bothell but works near Sunshine Market, said she loves the freshness of the produce. She can put it in her fruit bowl and it won't attract fruit flies because it's not spoiling right away, she said. “It's not the grocery store's produce,” she said, “and you can clearly tell, because of the way it lasts.”The brothers order from independent local farmers and smaller outfits like Peterson Fruit Co., a family-owned business in Mukilteo. Often it's a customer request that brings a new product into the store. That's how the brothers started carrying raw milk from Jackie's Jersey Milk in Bellingham. They started out selling 18 bottles a week and now sell 90.They also sell fresh goat milk, which is even harder to find; theirs comes from Lucky Hook Farm in Moses Lake.“People drive from like, Arlington and stuff, just to come buy it,” Josh said.They also sell organic eggs from Stiebrs Farms in Yelm, fresh every three days, he said. And duck eggs, which he described as “a very rich egg” beloved by Asians. Another big seller is their raw honey, purchased from a beekeeper with 46 beehives ranging from Mill Creek to Walla Walla, Josh said.“It is like, the best honey out there,” he said, adding, “We believe 110 percent in our honey.”There are also familiar items like chocolate milk from Twin Brooks Creamery in Lynden, coconut water, Bulgarian feta cheese and Beechers Cheese. Other jarred and canned products give a nod to the brothers' Middle Eastern roots. There's olive oil from Lebanon and Tunisia, coriander from Pakistan, Turkish figs, dolmas and cornichons, tahini paste and dates.Although they consider themselves Americans, the brothers fled with their family from Iraq in 1992, in the wake of the first Gulf War. Aided by Red Cross and United Nations workers after crossing into Saudi Arabia, the Almtowaqs made their way to Washington state, living in Everett for a time and then Lynnwood. His family history may explain in part why Alex has studied philosophy and history and seems just as prone to discussing Plato, Socrates and Galileo as he is to talking produce.Indeed, the conversation at Sunshine Market seems to be part of the customer service.“One of the coolest things here is being able to meet with the brothers,” said store regular Doug Clark, maneuvering through the market in his wheelchair. “And since I'm disabled, they actually have excellent customer service.”He's also partial to the produce, he said.“I've gone up to the Yakima fruit stand, just to compare prices and quality,” he said, “and I just turned around and came back here.”Retired media-arts teacher Claire Beach, of Edmonds, called Alex's impassioned explanations his “TED talks,” referring to the short, powerful talks made popular by the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences.She chatted with Alex on a recent visit, but that didn't distract her from the produce, which she said has helped her recover from a serious illness. She's been following an anti-inflammatory diet, including cutting down on carbs, and has lost 40 pounds and regained her vigor, she said.“This is the first time in my life I'm eating what my body wants,” said Beach, adding that she grew up in the South. “I was raised in Betty Crocker Land.”Customers like Beach are inspiring, Alex said.“When people come back and they tell you they feel better, healthier, stronger — it's a good feeling,” he said. “It keeps you going.”He could be making a lot more money as an engineer, but said he doesn't like sitting behind a desk.“Engineering is a hobby,” he said. “It's something I do because I love it.“But selling produce is different. You're selling something that feeds the entire world.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "STAMFORD — By all accounts, the Ridgefield 12-year old Little League team sports one of the most dangerous lineups in the District 1 tournament, needing no help to succeed, but when given a few extra outs to play with they make the opposition pay. Ridgefield twice struck out with two outs in the second inning, but both batters reached base on wild pitches, extending the inning and allowing the bats to get going. And they got going in a big way, busting out for nine runs in the second inning on the way to an 11-6 victory over Weston in the District 1 Little League double-elimination tournament at Springdale Little League Field in Stamford Friday evening. With the win, Ridgefield moves on in the winner’s bracket while Weston falls into the loser’s bracket where it will next play an elimination game Saturday against Wilton. Ridgefield coach Jeff Lacoille said the extra few chances in the second inning were a blessing to his team. “That was huge and we had a nice breakout inning,” Lacoille said. “I kind of made some mistakes out there early and they picked me up.” That breakout inning featured home runs by Johnny Briody and Jake Bongo with eight of the nine Ridgefield batters scoring in the inning and Bongo coming around twice in the frame. For Ridgefield, Bongo scored twice and had 2 RBI; Briody had 2 RBI and a double to go with his home run; Alex Hanna was 2 for 4 with two runs and a RBI and Luke Barrientos drove in two runs on the evening. Weston coach Seve Esposito said at this stage in the tournament it is tough to win when making mistakes. “We can’t do that,” Esposito said. “We are like a dark horse in this tournament because we have never gotten this far but we have done that by making no mistakes. When you start giving up 3, 4, 5 outs an inning that’s how it happens.” For Weston, Myles Lehrman was 4 for 4 with two doubles and two runs scored; Evan Levine had a home run, double and 5 RBI and Alex Olsen hit a home run and scored three runs as Weston chipped away at the lead but could not whittle it down. Weston led 2-0 in the second with Levine plating two runs with a double. Weston added a run in the fourth on Olsen’s home run and three more in the sixth on Levine’s blast. Ridgefield tacked on two more runs in the fifth, padding the lead with runs driven in by Jack Gonzalez and Diego Pepe. Ridgefield 11, Weston 6 Batteries: R - Jack Bohrer, Andrew Forsyth (2, W), Johnny Briody (4), Luke Barrientos (6) and Jason Hartnett. W - Andrew Levine (L), Alex Olsen (2), Dante Esposito (4), Stephen Marshalko (5) and Andrew Amato",

    "DiffbotBody": "Newly sworn Officer Caleb Holder said he grew up following a few more rules than most kids. But, that helped make him the civic-minded person he is today. Now, he’s looking forward to following the footsteps of his dad, retired Sgt. Danny Holder, who served the Lubbock Police Department for 30 years before retiring last year. “Just growing up around it, him being an officer just influenced me to always want to do that when I was older,” said the younger Holder. “There’s always the desire to help others and just to be able to serve people, to do something productive as a job every day and at the same time, it’s something you can enjoy and it’s fun protecting people.” Holder was among 11 newly uniformed officers who rose their right hands and swore to faithfully execute the duties of an LPD officer to the best of their abilities. During the graduation ceremony Friday at City Bank Coliseum, LPD officers Timothy Varner and Danny Tickner received a Medal of Valor award for an incident May 14, where they pulled to safety two people who were in trapped in the water at Canyon Lakes Dam. Corporal Jason LePage was also promoted during the ceremony from his previous position as an officer. The class that graduated Friday began its journey last September with more than 160 applicants taking the written and physical exams. With only 11 making it all the way through training, Lt. Chris Daniel said he’s watched the officers grow and mature. “The biggest thing is to see ... how much they change and understand the laws of the state as well as the constitution,” said Daniel, who is a lieutenant assigned to the Lubbock Police Academy. “I’m extremely proud. The commitment and the effort that they have to put forth to go for 24 weeks is immense. It’s not just an 8 to 5 job, to be able to be successful, they have to work on it on their off time as well.” Incoming Officer Sarah Martinez moved back to her hometown of Lubbock to go through officer training after graduating from Sam Houston State University with a degree in criminal justice. “Criminal justice and law enforcement has always been something I’ve been interested in,” she said. “You’re not behind the desk, it’s something new every day and you get a chance to serve your community.” After months of testing, training and dedication, Martinez will start her first day of field training Saturday. “It was definitely not easy, but if that’s what you truly want and you put in the time and the effort, it’s definitely doable,” she said. “All of the rank and all of my fellow classmates are 100 percent behind me. It’s definitely awesome. It’s an awesome feeling to know that even though you might be in some tough situations, you’re going to have some great people backing you.” Despite graduating Friday, Holder said the reality of being an officer probably won’t hit him until he starts field training on Saturday. “I’m excited, ready to get out there and use what I’ve learned,” he said. sarah.rafique@lubbockonline.com • 766-2159 Follow Sarah on Twitter @SarahRafique Lubbock Police Department Ceremony Slideshow link: http://lubbockonline.com/slideshow/2015-07-10/11-officers-join-lubbock-police-department#slide-1 Graduating officers: Sean Dickson John Geeslin, recipient of the highest academic average award Jason-Tyler Harville, recipient of the physical training award and spoke during the ceremony on behalf of the entire graduating class Caleb Holder Jake Keeling Jonathan Larsen, recipient of the top shooter award and selected by his peers as the honor graduate Sarah Martinez Timothy Moore Jeremy Perez Michael Sullivan Justin Wood",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Daily Mail, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

After receiving flak for record low results in the secondary and the higher secondary state board examinations that led to a series of brainstorming sessions by the education department for a new roadmap, the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) has come out with a solution to avoid a similar situation in the future. As a token of appreciation to schools scoring 100 per cent results, the GSHSEB has decided to “reward” those with schools scoring below 30 per cent results under its “adoption” policy. As per the latest decision, a total of 646 schools — both secondary (Class X) and higher secondary (Class XII) with 100 per cent results in the 2015 board examinations — have to adopt the nearest schools up to Class X, having a history of “poor” results (below 30 per cent). Orders for the implementation of this scheme from the current academic session has been recently passed to all the district education officers by the GSHSEB. This would be applied to the government as well as the grant-in-aid schools. Though this adoption scheme started at a low-scale in Bhavnagar by its district education officer (DEO) S L Dodiya last year, it was noticed by the GSHSEB after there was a marked improvement in the schools that were adopted. “While discussing various measures to improve the results, somebody informed about this adoption scheme being introduced in Bhavnagar.

McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

    "DiffbotBody": "Today, it starts to get really real for the more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants that work for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV). Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue. In years 2016 and 2018, flight attendants would instead get a 3 percent annual bonus, that would subsequently be taxed at 40 percent. And some flight attendants are upset about the new way vacation benefits will be calculated under terms of the proposed contract — a complicated system that will create a more defined two-tier culture of full-time and part-time employees at the airline. The new contract also calls for longer duty day hours for flight attendants in some instances, rising from 10.5 hours to 12 hours — which was not what many flight attendants were hoping to see in a new contract. But even much smaller things in the proposed contract are being viewed as losses by some flight attendants. They include a new provision that requires flight attendants to report for duty 45 minutes before the schedule departure of flights on Southwest's new — and much larger — Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that seats approximately 30 more passengers than the Boeing 737-700 series model. Previously, flight attendants were required to be at the plane 30 minutes before departure. Southwest Airlines is expected to add many more 737-800 aircraft to its fleet starting next year. One truly veteran Southwest Airlines flight attendant who has clocked well over 30 years with the carrier had this to say today after reading through the new proposed contract: \"I have seen enough and compared to our previous contract language to know for certain this is a concessionary contract. Also, even though there is no defined contract language for retroactive pay, it has always been negotiated for our flight attendants going back to the date the contract expired (in 2013 in this instance). There is no retro pay, just a signing bonus (in the proposed contract). The bonus is taxed at 40 percent.\" Other flight attendants I heard from today point the finger directly at Southwest management, including CEO Gary Kelly, for all the angst the new proposed contract is generating among flight attendants as they prepare to vote on it. Noted one flight attendant: \"The negative publicity Gary Kelly is getting in the media is exactly what he wants to sweep under the rug. He thrives on feeling everyone is behind him 100 percent. I really think he has lost contact with the real world.\" A spokesman for Local 556 did not return a call seeking comment today or provide a copy of the tentative contract agreed to by Local 556's executive board and Southwest Airlines management.",

    "DiffbotBody": "I have noticed in my 32 years of veterinary practice that large breed dogs, especially German Shepherds, have larger and more frequent watery stools and digestive problems with commercial dog food. Owners and their veterinarians often observe the same problem. As it turns out there are anatomical and physiological reasons for this: The digestive tract of large dogs functions differently than smaller dogs, creating this problem. Veterinary researchers from France presented their findings during a lecture I attended at the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Symposium in Indianapolis, Indiana recently. What are These Digestive Differences? The weight of the intestines in large dogs is only 3 percent of their body weight compared to 7 percent in smaller breeds. This means there is less intestinal area for digestion and absorption of the nutrients in the diet. The time that food spends in the colon is longer for large breed dogs. That means that the colon bacteria have longer to ferment food products. This increases by-products that promote more water in the colon, causing more watery, frequent stools. What Are the Solutions to These Digestive Differences? More non-fermentable fiber in the diet. The guaranteed analysis on the label of dog food lists the total crude fiber, which really is not an indication of the fiber in the diet. Fiber can be divided into two major types. The first is indigestible or digestible fiber. As their names imply, indigestible fiber adds bulk to the diet and stool and passes with the stool. Digestible fiber can be used by the cells of the colon lining and are divided into two classes, fermentable fiber and non-fermentable fiber. Bacteria in the colon use fermentable fiber as food to produce fats and lactic acid, which causes the intestinal contents to react like a sponge and draw water into the colon. By decreasing the amount of fermentable fiber in the diet, there is less water in the colon and large dogs have a more firm, formed stool. Unfortunately, less fermentable fiber in the diet of smaller breed dogs causes constipation and a harder stool because of the anatomical intestinal differences. Increased protein digestibility. Large breed dogs experience poorer stool quality with less digestible protein. This, I think, is an important point, but because the researchers worked for Purina they only compared wheat gluten protein to chicken meal protein. They found improvements in stool quality with the higher digestible wheat gluten, but the water content of the stool for both groups was quite high. I think this is why owners of large breed dogs have varied responses with commercial dog food. Their dogs have a variable response to wheat gluten or chicken meal. Large dogs on homemade diets with highly digestible meat proteins tend to have much better stool quality. Resistant, gelatinized starch improves stool quality in large dogs. The researchers found that the starches in foods that were less fermentable and more highly processed had better stool quality. In order to increase the gelatinization of starch it has to be exposed to extreme increases in temperature during processing. What these researchers found is that if you cook the hell out of the starch in the food, larger breed dogs will make better stool. But the higher temperature also causes more destruction of the nutrients in the food. The stool is more firm but the dog may be malnourished. What is the Take Home? Large dogs have different nutritional needs. Large dogs need less fermentable fiber in their diet. Large dogs need more digestible protein in their diet. Large dogs need less fermentable starch in their diet. Commercial diets may not be the best solution for large dogs.

What’s Happening: The Error on Dylann Roof's Background Check The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans. When the cyberbreach was first reported in June, only 4 million Americans, mostly government workers and contractors, were thought to be affected. The Confederate flag comes down in Columbia: One day after South Carolina lawmakers voted to remove the divisive symbol from state grounds, an honor guard removed it in a ceremony on Friday. A crowd cheered and chanted “U.S.A.” and “take it down” as the flag was lowered. The NCAA announced that the state is now eligible to host future tournaments.

(Gregorio Borgia / AP) Sophie Gilbert: “Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman is indisputably the most eagerly awaited work of fiction since Rowling wrapped up her Potter series in 2007, in no small part because it offers answers to the question of what happened to Scout, Lee’s sagacious and scrappy creation.” Megan Garber: “The other explanation for all the Fitbitterness may come down to the original software bug: human nature. We bore and burn out easily—particularly, it seems, when it comes to fitness.” Christopher Orr: “There’s plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted, and the minions themselves are consistently amusing...

    "DiffbotBody": "Toward the end of Thursday night's Van Halen show at the Concord Pavilion, with the rest of his band offstage, guitarist Edward Van Halen began his guitar solo. For nearly 40 years, this moment has been the high point of a Van Halen concert. Just when he started the \"Little Guitars\" portion, a spotlight from the top of the venue lit him up, highlighting a sudden mini-downpour of rain. In California. In July. Can an Edward Van Halen guitar solo make it rain? Probably not, but it was about as likely as anything else in the storied band's two-hour set. The rain was a strangely wonderful coincidence of timing during what was a surprisingly strong showing by a band some say is on its last legs. CHRIS PIZZELLO/ASSOCIATED PRESS David Lee Roth, left, and Eddie Van Halen perform with their band Van Halen at the Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas in May. The veteran band turned in a strong show at Concord Pavilion Thursday night, and plays the Shoreline Amphitheatre on July 16.. ( Chris Pizzello ) The three original Van Halen members are eligible for Social Security (or at least very close to it). In a recent Billboard interview, Edward ripped former bandmate Michael Anthony and took several shots at singer David Lee Roth, with whom he has to share a stage all summer. The band's new live album \"Tokyo Dome Live in Concert\" hasn't been received well, with most of the complaints aimed at Roth's vocals. Yet there they were Thursday, power-gliding through an evening rich with deep cuts from Van Halen's first six records that even some die-hard fans likely can't recall hearing live. There's a couple of ways to enjoy a Van Halen show in 2015. One is to remember how bad things got a little more than a decade ago, when Edward's substance abuse got so serious his performances became embarrassing. Now clean, seemingly happy and healthy, the guitarist again makes it look easy. The other key thing is to remember that Roth is Roth. He was never the greatest singer live and, even during the glory days of the early 1980s, favored showmanship over tight musical performance. But everyone was on top of their game Thursday. Opening with the powerhouse \"Light Up the Sky,\" the band charged into \"Runnin' with the Devil\" and \"Romeo Delight.\" On the latter, Roth -- once a wild gymnast on stage, now more of a quick-shuffling Vaudevillian performer -- initially stuck to the original vocal lines, something he rarely does for an entire song. The rendition was surprisingly big and tight. \"That's right, baby,\" Roth snickered at someone in the crowd. \"I'm gonna pretend I'm loaded and you're gonna pretend you're Bill Cosby.\" Yep. Dave is still Dave. If Roth and Van Halen are an old couple only staying together for the kids, they fake it well. At 60 and held up by an artificial hip, Edward doesn't move around much anymore, but he plays as well as ever. The band brought back \"Drop Dead Legs,\" a methodical, semi-sexy strip romp, with Edward and son Wolfgang Van Halen's backing vocals spot on. Former bassist Anthony's superb backing vocals on the old stuff is sorely missed, especially during \"Feel Your Love Tonight,\" but Wolfgang's vocals were passable. A brief toe-dip into more recent material kept pace, with \"She's the Woman,\" and a blazing \"Chinatown\" (\"If you go to China, is there an America Town?\" Roth wondered). A few songs and one drum solo later, the band reached deep into the catalog for the seldom-heard crowd favorites \"Women in Love,\" and an absolutely epic \"In a Simple Rhyme,\" for which Roth showed due respect by staying on-point and even pushing his voice. He kept it up during the challenging \"Dirty Movies.\" Roth knew how to play to his strengths, especially while getting bluesy with harmonica and acoustic guitar during \"Ice Cream Man.\" From there it was a downhill rush of classics, sandwiched around the guitar solo: \"Unchained\" (during which Roth purred something about \"Fifty Shades of Dave\") \"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,\" \"You Really Got Me,\" \"Panama\" and \"Jump.\" There was no encore, as if the band didn't want to risk blemishing such a surprisingly strong showing. Whether Roth and Van Halen's fragile partnership can hold, or whether the Bay Area will see another Van Halen show like it is anyone's guess. But all was well again -- at least for one night. They'll try again July 16 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View. Contact Tony Hicks at Thicks@BayAreaNewsGroup.com, Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.

Starz will present their San Diego Comic-Con panel of the series on Friday, July 10, 2015. The series is produced by the original filmmakers of the franchise, Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell, along with showrunner Craig DiGregorio. (Matt Klitscher/Starz Entertainment via AP) SAN DIEGO (AP) — Here's the latest from Friday's sessions at the Comic-Con International fan festival in and around the San Diego Convention Center (all times Pacific): 6:54 p.m. Bruce Campbell is reprising the \"Evil Dead\" role he originated in 1981, this time on the small screen. Campbell and franchise creator Sam Raimi showed a trailer for their new series, \"Ash vs. Evil Dead,\" which is set to premiere on Starz on Oct. 31. Raimi said the show picks up 30 years after the last \"Evil Dead\" film, 1992's \"Army of Darkness.\" Campbell's character has again unleashed a force of deadly evil, and he spends the 10-episode season trying to contain it. Campbell said he's always loved playing Ash \"because he's one of the most flawed heroes you can have.\" The trailer shown Friday in one of Comic-Con's exhibition halls shows Ash wielding his trademark chain saw, which in one instance he uses against a demon granny. Raimi said he wanted to unveil his new Starz show at Comic-Con because \"this is the home of the 'Evil Dead.'\" Even when he came to the fan festival to showcase \"Spider-Man\" footage, Raimi said fans would say, \"Screw that. Where's 'Evil Dead?'\" ___ 6:35 p.m. The dark side of the force is also at Comic-Con. Audiences got to meet \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" bad guys Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and Gwendoline Christie for the first time. Gleeson says his character General Hux is definitely evil. He also accidentally revealed that the name of his post is Starkiller Base. Driver wouldn't reveal anything about his character Kylo Ren, but he did say that on set that he thought a lot about the difference between being bad and being right. Christie says she is excited to be playing a female storm trooper. She says it's a role that is not about how her character Captain Phasma looks in the flesh. Director J.J. Abrams did not show any new footage from the film, but he did roll a behind-the-scenes segment. \"Star Wars\" vets and \"Force Awakens\" stars Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher also made an appearance on stage. ___ 6:30 p.m. Oscar Isaac, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have made a surprise appearance at the \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" panel at Comic-Con. All are newcomers to the \"Star Wars\" universe and will make their debut in the film, which hits theaters on Dec. 18. Boyega plays a stormtrooper named Finn. He said he'd spent time on the convention floor disguised in a helmet, much to the delight of the audience. Ridley, who plays a scavenger, said she trained hard for the stunts and fights in the film. Her elaborate choreography was made only more difficult by the 125 degree Abu Dhabi heat. As X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, Isaac laughed that he tried to get co-star Harrison Ford to teach him how to fly. Ford just said, \"it's fake.\" ___ 6:00 p.m. The force was very much awake in the minutes before the highly anticipated \"Star Wars\" panel kicked off at Comic-Con. The massive Hall H crowd bustled with energy, chanting \"Star Wars\" in anticipation — and not just because of the free coffee and doughnuts that Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy had delivered earlier. Host Chris Hardwick said \"some amazing things are going to happen\" before introducing Kennedy, director J.J. Abrams and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan. They also brought out a new character, Baba Joe, a moving, tortoise-like creature with a pack on his back designed by Neal Scanlan. Abrams currently has a cut of the film and is in the editing phase. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" hits theaters on Dec. 18. ___ 4:30 p.m. Pop-culture lovers don't need credentials to get in on the fun and freebies of Comic-Con. The Interactive Zone at Petco Park is offering various diversions for fans all weekend, no tickets required. A giant, inflatable version of Snoopy's doghouse boasts a beagle petting zoo. The new show \"Scream Queens\" set up a free-fall rollercoaster that elicits screams audible from across the street. Intel is hosting a video-game tent, where fans can play on big screens. The anticipated video game \"Dark Souls III\" staged an elaborate setup for photos in front of a creepy character that spurted black blood. The horror film \"Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\" prompted participants to practice their knot-tying and tent-building skills. There was even free food: Pizza rolls that came with a pair of red sunglasses. ___ 3:35 p.m. Jon Snow is still dead, at least according to the silences of the secretive group of \"Game of Thrones\" cast members at Comic-Con. Stars Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and others skirted the pointed question as to whether or not Kit Harington would really not be returning for season 6 of the popular HBO show. His character, the pivotal Jon Snow, was stabbed to death in the season 5 finale. Fans speculate that somehow he'll be back. Secrecy reigned supreme at the panel, which served more as a retrospective of previous seasons. Host Seth Myers said outright that it would be difficult for the cast to talk at all about the upcoming season. Many were absent from the large ensemble cast in San Diego including Emilia Clarke, Lena Heady, and Nicolai Coster-Waldau. Also not present: Showrunners David Benioff, D.B. Weiss and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R. R. Martin. ___ 3:15 p.m. The Power Rangers are powering up for their 22nd season on TV this summer and another foray onto the big screen in 2017. The company that created the team of five colorful, costumed superheroes celebrated the franchise's longevity with a special trip to Comic-Con, where it unveiled a series of collectible toys. Most spectacular were the $175 Black Legacy Saba Saber and a 4-foot-tall fiberglass sculpture of the Green Ranger that sells for $4,000. So how have the Power Rangers held on to their appeal for all these years? \"It's simply because I think it's every kid's entry point into the superhero genre,\" said Brian Casentini, head of development and production for the brand and producer of the forthcoming film. \"And every season it delivers these core themes, particularly teamwork. I think it's also about the gender neutrality — it provides that access point for girls — and also that diversity along with the teamwork, so people of all races are seeing themselves in these characters.\" ___ 1:40 p.m. \"The Walking Dead\" fans shouldn't expect characters from the South-set series to ever cross paths with the Angelenos depicted in the upcoming West Coast spin-off series \"Fear the Walking Dead.\" The show's cast and crew told the crowd at Comic-Con on Friday that the AMC shows are separated by both space and time. The first season of \"Fear the Walking Dead\" takes place in East Los Angeles over the span of a few weeks when \"The Walking Dead\" protagonist Rick Grimes was in a coma during that series' first episode. \"I think when you have two shows that live inside the same mythology, you would love for them to collide at some point, but there's no plan,\" said \"Fear the Walking Dead\" showrunner Dave Erickson. However, one of the shows cast members is angling for a testosterone-centric crossover. \"I'd like to meet Rick Grimes because I've got a bromance going on,\" said Cliff Curtis, who plays the patriarch of the family at the center of the prequel. \"Fear the Walking Dead\" is set to debut Aug. 29. ___ 12:15 p.m. \"The Walking Dead\" will be taking a look back. Producer Scott Gimple teased the Comic-Con crowd with the possibility of more flashbacks in the upcoming sixth season of the AMC zombie apocalypse drama. Gimple told the audience at the San Diego Convention Center that there's \"a whole lot of flashbacks in the first half of the season.\" The showrunner added that he's working on an episode that takes place in the past. The ominous trap-setting group teased last season called the Wolves will also be returning, possibly \"in a way that you don't expect,\" said Gimple. The session kicked off Friday with a trailer featuring a power struggle between Andrew Lincoln's Rick and Lennie James' Morgan — as well as lots of zombies. ___ 10:12 a.m. Only at Comic-Con can a movie screening turn into a possible set visit. Fans who came to a late-night showing of exclusive footage from the forthcoming \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" Thursday were first to enter a contest that could bring them to the set of the film's third installment.

    "LabBody": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — Here's the latest from Friday's sessions at the Comic-Con International fan festival in and around the San Diego Convention Center (all times Pacific): 6:54 p.m. Bruce Campbell is reprising the \"Evil Dead\" role he originated in 1981, this time on the small screen. Campbell and franchise creator Sam Raimi showed a trailer for their new series, \"Ash vs. Evil Dead,\" which is set to premiere on Starz on Oct. 31. Raimi said the show picks up 30 years after the last \"Evil Dead\" film, 1992's \"Army of Darkness.\" Campbell's character has again unleashed a force of deadly evil, and he spends the 10-episode season trying to contain it. Campbell said he's always loved playing Ash \"because he's one of the most flawed heroes you can have.\" The trailer shown Friday in one of Comic-Con's exhibition halls shows Ash wielding his trademark chain saw, which in one instance he uses against a demon granny. Raimi said he wanted to unveil his new Starz show at Comic-Con because \"this is the home of the 'Evil Dead.'\" Even when he came to the fan festival to showcase \"Spider-Man\" footage, Raimi said fans would say, \"Screw that. Where's 'Evil Dead?'\" ___ 6:35 p.m. The dark side of the force is also at Comic-Con. Audiences got to meet \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" bad guys Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and Gwendoline Christie for the first time. Gleeson says his character General Hux is definitely evil. He also accidentally revealed that the name of his post is Starkiller Base. Driver wouldn't reveal anything about his character Kylo Ren, but he did say that on set that he thought a lot about the difference between being bad and being right. Christie says she is excited to be playing a female storm trooper. She says it's a role that is not about how her character Captain Phasma looks in the flesh. Director J.J. Abrams did not show any new footage from the film, but he did roll a behind-the-scenes segment. \"Star Wars\" vets and \"Force Awakens\" stars Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher also made an appearance on stage. ___ 6:30 p.m. Oscar Isaac, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have made a surprise appearance at the \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" panel at Comic-Con. All are newcomers to the \"Star Wars\" universe and will make their debut in the film, which hits theaters on Dec. 18. Boyega plays a stormtrooper named Finn. He said he'd spent time on the convention floor disguised in a helmet, much to the delight of the audience. Ridley, who plays a scavenger, said she trained hard for the stunts and fights in the film. Her elaborate choreography was made only more difficult by the 125 degree Abu Dhabi heat. As X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, Isaac laughed that he tried to get co-star Harrison Ford to teach him how to fly. Ford just said, \"it's fake.\" ___ 6:00 p.m. The force was very much awake in the minutes before the highly anticipated \"Star Wars\" panel kicked off at Comic-Con. The massive Hall H crowd bustled with energy, chanting \"Star Wars\" in anticipation — and not just because of the free coffee and doughnuts that Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy had delivered earlier. Host Chris Hardwick said \"some amazing things are going to happen\" before introducing Kennedy, director J.J. Abrams and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan. They also brought out a new character, Baba Joe, a moving, tortoise-like creature with a pack on his back designed by Neal Scanlan. Abrams currently has a cut of the film and is in the editing phase. \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" hits theaters on Dec. 18. ___ 4:30 p.m. Pop-culture lovers don't need credentials to get in on the fun and freebies of Comic-Con. The Interactive Zone at Petco Park is offering various diversions for fans all weekend, no tickets required. A giant, inflatable version of Snoopy's doghouse boasts a beagle petting zoo. The new show \"Scream Queens\" set up a free-fall rollercoaster that elicits screams audible from across the street. Intel is hosting a video-game tent, where fans can play on big screens. The anticipated video game \"Dark Souls III\" staged an elaborate setup for photos in front of a creepy character that spurted black blood. The horror film \"Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse\" prompted participants to practice their knot-tying and tent-building skills. There was even free food: Pizza rolls that came with a pair of red sunglasses. ___ 3:35 p.m. Jon Snow is still dead, at least according to the silences of the secretive group of \"Game of Thrones\" cast members at Comic-Con. Stars Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and others skirted the pointed question as to whether or not Kit Harington would really not be returning for season 6 of the popular HBO show. His character, the pivotal Jon Snow, was stabbed to death in the season 5 finale. Fans speculate that somehow he'll be back. Secrecy reigned supreme at the panel, which served more as a retrospective of previous seasons. Host Seth Myers said outright that it would be difficult for the cast to talk at all about the upcoming season. Many were absent from the large ensemble cast in San Diego including Emilia Clarke, Lena Heady, and Nicolai Coster-Waldau. Also not present: Showrunners David Benioff, D.B. Weiss and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R. R. Martin. ___ 3:15 p.m. The Power Rangers are powering up for their 22nd season on TV this summer and another foray onto the big screen in 2017. The company that created the team of five colorful, costumed superheroes celebrated the franchise's longevity with a special trip to Comic-Con, where it unveiled a series of collectible toys. Most spectacular were the $175 Black Legacy Saba Saber and a 4-foot-tall fiberglass sculpture of the Green Ranger that sells for $4,000. So how have the Power Rangers held on to their appeal for all these years? \"It's simply because I think it's every kid's entry point into the superhero genre,\" said Brian Casentini, head of development and production for the brand and producer of the forthcoming film. \"And every season it delivers these core themes, particularly teamwork. I think it's also about the gender neutrality — it provides that access point for girls — and also that diversity along with the teamwork, so people of all races are seeing themselves in these characters.\" ___ 1:40 p.m. \"The Walking Dead\" fans shouldn't expect characters from the South-set series to ever cross paths with the Angelenos depicted in the upcoming West Coast spin-off series \"Fear the Walking Dead.\" The show's cast and crew told the crowd at Comic-Con on Friday that the AMC shows are separated by both space and time. The first season of \"Fear the Walking Dead\" takes place in East Los Angeles over the span of a few weeks when \"The Walking Dead\" protagonist Rick Grimes was in a coma during that series' first episode. \"I think when you have two shows that live inside the same mythology, you would love for them to collide at some point, but there's no plan,\" said \"Fear the Walking Dead\" showrunner Dave Erickson. However, one of the shows cast members is angling for a testosterone-centric crossover. \"I'd like to meet Rick Grimes because I've got a bromance going on,\" said Cliff Curtis, who plays the patriarch of the family at the center of the prequel. \"Fear the Walking Dead\" is set to debut Aug. 29. ___ 12:15 p.m. \"The Walking Dead\" will be taking a look back. Producer Scott Gimple teased the Comic-Con crowd with the possibility of more flashbacks in the upcoming sixth season of the AMC zombie apocalypse drama. Gimple told the audience at the San Diego Convention Center that there's \"a whole lot of flashbacks in the first half of the season.\" The showrunner added that he's working on an episode that takes place in the past. The ominous trap-setting group teased last season called the Wolves will also be returning, possibly \"in a way that you don't expect,\" said Gimple. The session kicked off Friday with a trailer featuring a power struggle between Andrew Lincoln's Rick and Lennie James' Morgan — as well as lots of zombies. ___ 10:12 a.m. Only at Comic-Con can a movie screening turn into a possible set visit. Fans who came to a late-night showing of exclusive footage from the forthcoming \"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials\" Thursday were first to enter a contest that could bring them to the set of the film's third installment. Beginning Friday, anyone can enter the free sweepstakes presented by movie-promotion company Kernel. The grand prize is a trip for two to the set of Fox's \"Maze Runner: The Death Cure.\" \"The Scorch Trials\" is set to hit theaters in the fall; \"The Death Cure\" is slated for release in 2017.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Google has released an Ethernet adapter to solve the issue of the Chromecast having connection issues. While the adapter will add to the wires behind the TV, it should ensure that as data transfers get more intense with things like gaming, the Chromecast is able to handle it. (Photo : Google) The Google Chromecast has been hailed as one of the easiest and most affordable ways to stream video content from mobile devices and computers to a TV, however, many users do experience one particular issue with it — dropped connections. Thankfully, for those who experience dropped connections often, Google has introduced a new Ethernet adapter for Chromecast that costs only $15. The Chromecast itself connects to 2.4 Ghz wireless networks, which are often crowded, meaning that finding a completely clear signal is very difficult. This can often cause significant interruptions to video using the Chromecast. While being able to connect to 5 Ghz networks would help the issue a lot, so far, Chromecasts cannot connect to them. This adapter, however, should be a good fix to those issues, at least in the meantime. The adapter is simply a power brick that plugs into the Chromecast, offering both power and data transfer at the same time. Then, the user simply needs to plug an Ethernet cable into the adapter from the Internet router, and users should have great quality, uninterrupted video streaming. The adapter supports data transfers of up to 100 Mbps, which should be more than enough for video streaming. Of course, it's likely that the next Chromecast will support 5 Ghz wireless networks, which should solve the issue for most users, however, for those who want to be extra sure or don't want to buy a new Chromecast when it finally comes out, the new adapter is a great option. It will be especially useful for individuals who have their wireless router near the TV, eliminating the need to run an Ethernet cable across the room. Users will be pleased to see the focus that Google has kept on the Chromecast. Only a few weeks ago, the company announced that Chromecast would support Google Slides, allowing users to easily cast their presentations from their smartphone. The company is also reportedly going to use Chromecast as more of a gaming device as time goes, on allowing users to stream games from their smartphones to their TV and use their phones as controllers for the games. Of course, this will require a good connection between devices, making it even more important that the Chromecast doesn't drop its connection to the Internet. Chromecast isn't the only streaming device that Google offers, with the company also offering a more fully-featured device called the Nexus Player. The Nexus Player has not been anywhere near as successful as the Chromecast, however, largely because of the price, with the Nexus Player coming in at $79, compared with the Chromecast's $35.

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

    "DiffbotBody": "The Legal Metrology department has issued a notice to Runwal Builders for allegedly not giving residents of a Thane building the flat sizes they were originally promised The Legal Metrology department of the state has issued a notice to a top builder for allegedly not giving home buyers the area they had been promised in their flats. Thane’s Legal Metrology department issued the notice to Runwal Builders earlier this week, after it found that the carpet area of the 3BHK flat in its Runwal Pearl project, Thane (West), wasn’t what was detailed in the agreement. According to R Dalvi, a senior officer from the Metrology department, Thane, the notice was issued earlier this week to the builder, seeking his reply on the same. “We received complaints from members of the building Runwal Pearl and found their complaint to be legitimate, and hence we have issued the notice to the builder,” said Dalvi. On June 25, the members of the building had submitted a complaint to the Legal Metrology department, claiming that the area of the house that they had been given was not what the builder had promised. A team from the department visited the houses in the society and found out that the flats were only around 875 sq ft in area (each room was 71.38 sq metres and the attached balcony was 10.04 sq meters, making up 81.42 sq metres, or 876.4 sq ft, in all), compared to the 935 sq ft allegedly promised by the builder. Going flat out According to sources, most of the residents had moved to the building in 2012, and many then realised that the area given wasn’t the one offered in the agreement. They then corresponded with the builder several times, to no avail. “The members of the society heard that the Legal Metrology department can help them measure the flat and the ratified measurement also is a legal document. The department, when it measured the flat, found that the measurement was lower than promised. Earlier this week, the department sent the notice to the builder seeking his reply,” said a source. None of the residents in the building wished to comment on the issue and claimed that they do not wish to speak about it and have done whatever they had to do. However, the issue they have with the measurement done by the metrology department is that, the flat area calculated by the department includes even the balcony, which many claim isn’t part of the carpet area, and hence shouldn’t be added to the size of the flat. Even with the addition, the flat size is lower than promised. If no response is received from the builder within the stipulated time period, the Legal Metrology department files a complaint with the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, and takes the matter ahead legally. The other side Sandeep Runwal of Runwal Builders said, “There was no notice given to us before the legal metrology department carried out the measurement. Also, measurements were carried out four years after handing over possession; people must have carried out alterations. We do not know how the measurement has been done, we have given more area; our plans have been passed by the Thane Municipal Corporation. Why was the measurement done in our absence? The law of natural justice hasn’t been followed.” He added, “What I have been told is the usable area is more than what the home buyers were supposed to receive. Still they are raising issues. If they feel the carpet area is less, then the TMC officials should have also been called for the measurement.” What was promised \u003e\u003e A 3BHK apartment of 935 sq ft \u003e\u003e Actual flat size as per the Legal Metrology department’s measurement* is 876.4 sq ft (*This measurement also includes the balcony)",

    "DiffbotBody": "Strike up the band! The resistance band that is. Whether you are on the road, or barricaded in your home recovering from the death of your favorite Game of Thrones character, a total body workout is always accessible due to the portability and convenience of the resistance band. These flexible flab fighters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making them perfect for your daily exercise routine or assisted stretching (or to sling shot water balloons at that noisy neighbor). Here’s how to make the most of this one-man resistance band show: Chest to Impress. Find a sturdy support beam or column and evenly wrap your band around it at shoulder height. With your back turned away from the supporting structure, grab each handle and take a large step forward. The beauty of the band is that you can adjust its resistance simply by removing slack from the tube. The further you step away from the column, the harder the exercise becomes. With palms at shoulder height, push through your chest until your arms are completely extended. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions. Reverse Gears. The next exercise requires a similar setup, however you will be facing your support column rather than having your back to it. With a handle in each hand, take a big step backwards while pulling your hands in towards either side of your ribcage. Bring your feet back to center, and perform the same exercise with the opposite foot. The reverse lunge row is a powerful movement in that it targets major muscle groups and aids in bettering your balance. Balancing exercises should be incorporated into every workout routine, as they are crucial in strengthening your core, improving the integrity of your spine and preventing injuries from falls. Complete 15 repetitions per side. Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head. Crank out 12-15 repetitions. Repeat each exercise 3-5 times to guarantee a good burn, baby burn. Sometimes the best cure in the fight against fat is to apply a little resistance band-aid. Earn it.

    "DiffbotBody": "BEMIDJI -- Nolan Coyle was on his A-game Tuesday night as he threw a complete game shutout to help the Bemidji Bucks beat the Grand Rapids Indians 4-0 at Security Insurance Field. Advertisement Coyle threw all nine innings of Tuesday’s game and struck out an astounding 14 batters while walking one and giving up five hits. Coyle was matched pitch-for-pitch early Grand Rapids starter Andrew Geislinger who went 7 1/3 innings and gave up four runs, three earned, on nine hits while striking out eight and walking one. After two innings both pitchers had given up one hit and struck out four each before both faced adversity in the third inning. In the top of the inning, Coyle gave up a leadoff single, but he tried to erase the runner in the next at-bat when he fielded a ball off the mound. He went for second to turn a double, but his throw pulled the second baseman Cody Jenkins off the base and both runners were safe. Coyle worked his way out of the inning however with one of his 14 strikeouts, followed by a groundball and a fly ball to right field to escape the inning. Geislinger wasn’t able to escape his half of the third unharmed. Jake Tuholsky drew a leadoff walk before a wild pitch allowed him to move up to second base. Right fielder Cody Benson moved him to third with a single before a Nick Hovila double play gave Tuholsky a chance to score. It wasn’t until the sixth inning when Coyle faced another scare after a one-out single followed by an error and a wild pitch put runners on second and third. Coyle responded with strikeout No. 9 on the night and then got a fly ball to left field to escape another jam. In the bottom half of the sixth is when the Bucks’ started batting. Connor McNallan started the inning with a single before Tyler Nelson moved him over with a tough grounder to the third base. McNallan later moved to third on a wild pitch. Steve Prichard got the team’s first RBI of the night when the Grand Rapids’ fielder went home on a groundball, but McNallan slid into the plate before the tag was applied to make it 2-0 Bucks. Jenkins hit a leadoff single to start the seventh and was replaced for pinch runner Jake Krabbehoff. Krabehoff stole second and with two outs got to third on a single by Hovila to put runners on the corners. Hovila took for second and was safe during the next at-bat, but the catcher’s throw was wild and allowed Krabbehoff to scamper home to make it 3-0 Bemidji. Tyler Nelson smacked a ball to deep left-center field to begin the bottom of the eighth, but was thrown out between second and third in a fielder’s choice during the next at-bat, but did allow Prichard to advance to second. Dylan Weisert hit a RBI single to give the Bucks its final insurance run of the game before Coyle came out and shut the door with a 1-2-3 ninth inning including his 14th strikeout of the night. Bemidji will be back in action at 6:30 p.m. tonight when it takes on Nimrod at Menhaga. Tuesday will be the battle of Bemidji at 7 p.m. when the Bucks take on the Bemidji Blue Ox at Security Insurance Field. It will be the first time the two teams have met.

    "DiffbotBody": "Greece hasn’t exactly had an easy go of things lately. The country, which has been riddled with debt throughout the last decade, according to Vox, has needed bailouts and assistance from countries like Germany just to stay afloat and avoid total financial collapse. Most recently, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made a request for more bailout funds. Depending upon what happens with that request, Greece could either receive some reprieve from its lenders or see its banking system collapse, which would mean it no longer would be able to use the euro for its currency, according to The Associated Press. Though the crisis in Greece is a world away, this may be something that Americans can empathize with, given that Greece’s financial troubles are eerily similar to modern American poverty issues and one of America’s darkest periods, the Great Depression — which shows that Greece and the United States may not be all that different after all. But when you compare Greece's current crisis to the Great Depression, Greece may actually be worse off than the U.S. was during that time, according to The New York Times. “Greece is in its own Great Depression. But unlike the United States, it won't be able to get back on its feet as quickly,” Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told The New York Times. The country “is shackled by onerous rules and regulations, an aging population and a dysfunctional domestic political system … sharing important elements of sovereignty with its own creditors.” Greece can’t afford to pay its bills, which was something that America, conversely, could afford to do because of World War II and military spending, according to The Times. Similarly, America encouraged its people to seek employment and poured “billions of dollars into public jobs,” The Times reported. Meanwhile, Greece still has a 28 percent unemployment rate as of last year, with no signs of slowing down. Greece’s stock market is also worse than America’s was back then, The Times reported. The market spiraled down to -89 percent during the the Great Depression’s later years in 1932, while Greece’s hit a low of -91 percent in June 2012. But while Greece’s financial situation looks more troublesome than America’s did during the Great Depression, today's Americans appear worse off than the Greeks because of the United States' high amounts of debt and inability to get rid of that debt, according to Fortune. “Whatever happens,” Fortune reported, “the average American may be worse off than Greece.” In fact, Americans may have more debt based on income earned than the European country, Fortune reported. Greeks owe 1.77 euros for every euro they earn. Meanwhile, Americans owe $204,992 for every $55,192 they earn, Fortune reported. So while Greeks have a debt-to-income ratio of 177 percent, Americans’ sit at a whopping 370 percent, Fortune reported. And Greece’s debt can be forgiven, unlike the debt of an average American. Fortune reported that if Greece gets rescued from lenders and exits the eurozone, then Greeks won’t have any more debt. Meanwhile, Americans, even when they declare bankruptcy, still hold onto some debts, like student loans and housing debt. Greece can also print its own money, assuming it has to leave the eurozone, according to Fortune. Though this could cause inflation in the country, it will allow them to avoid a financial crisis and survive in the meantime, Fortune reported. But indebted Americans can’t print their own currency, which means U.S. citizens always have to pay back their debt. All of this points to the fact that the United States and Greece today have a lot in common, according to USA Today's editorial board. More than just their debt similarities, both countries have aging populations and “irresponsible banks lending to irresponsible borrowers,” USA Today said. Greece, though, is just a few years ahead of the United States. If America doesn’t realize these similarities, the United States could soon face a tragedy much like Greece’s in the future, USA Today said. “America is heading for its own debt crisis,” USA Today said. “It won't be complicated by whether it should drop out of a currency union. And it might be delayed by a vibrant and innovative private sector. But it could arrive in as little as a decade. And then everything will seem Greek to us.” Herb Scribner is a writer for Deseret News National. Send him an email at hscribner@deseretdigital.com or follow him on Twitter @herbscribner.",

A legitimate triple threat (or more), Tennessee certainly can attest to his ability to make plays in a lot of different ways. In last year’s game against the Vols, Cooper caught 11 passes for a school-record 233 yards and two touchdowns. And that was just part of the damage he inflicted on the Vols. He also rushed for a touchdown and threw a 30-yard touchdown pass. Cooper also is a dangerous kick and punt returner. With the Gamecocks breaking in a new starting quarterback this season, Steve Spurrier will be very creative in finding ways to put Cooper in a position to make plays. Cooper emerged as a potential playmaker as a true freshman, then had a breakout season in 2014, catching 69 passes for 1,136 yards and scoring 11 touchdowns.

    "DiffbotBody": "Daniel Mears / Detroit News via AP Oakland County Family Court Judge Lisa Gorcyca listens to attorneys arguments during the continuing court battle between Maya Eibschitz-Tsimhoni and her former husband, Omer Tsimhoni, who have been in court for years fighting, mostly, over who gets to see their children in Pontiac, Mich., on Friday, July 10, 2015. Friday, July 10, 2015 | 8 p.m. PONTIAC, Mich. — A judge on Friday released three siblings who have spent two weeks in juvenile detention for refusing to meet with their estranged father. Oakland County Judge Lisa Gorcyca said she's sending the children to a summer camp, at the request of the father. She held a hearing Friday, three days after a TV station reported her June 24 decision to put the kids — ages 15, 10 and 9 — at Children's Village. They were kept away from juveniles who are locked up there for committing crimes. \"The court finds that is in the children's best interests to grant the father's and the guardian ad litem's motion to allow the children to attend summer camp,\" Gorcyca said, referring to lawyers who represent the children. It isn't clear what will happen when the two-week camp ends. \"That's up to the judge,\" said Lisa Stern, an attorney for the mother. The case stems from a divorce that began in 2009. The judge blamed the mother for alienating the two boys and their younger sister from their father. The Associated Press is withholding the names of the mother and father to protect the identities of the children. Gorcyca likened the mother's influence on the children to the Charles Manson California cult in the 1960s, according to a transcript of an earlier hearing. Neil Rockind, a former prosecutor not involved in the case, said it was wrong to lock up the kids. \"They are still children and learned their behaviors from one or both parents,\" Rockind said. \"The key point, though, is they committed no crime.\"",

The Associated Press Published: Tuesday, July 7, 2015 at 4:43 p.m. Last Modified: Tuesday, July 7, 2015 at 4:43 p.m. In the days leading up to SEC Media Days (Monday-July 16) in Hoover, Ala., we offer you a Daily Football Fix. Today, we rank the road SEC schedules for each of the 14 teams. Sometimes, it’s not who you play but where you play those teams. Of course, things can change as a season goes along. 1. Arkansas: Tennessee, Alabama, Ole Miss, LSU. Tough road for the improved Razorbacks. 2. Alabama: Georgia, Texas A\u0026M, Mississippi State, Auburn. And for each of these teams, this will be a huge game. 3. Ole Miss: Alabama, Florida, Auburn, Mississippi State. When your soft game is at The Swamp, it’s a rough road. 4. LSU: Mississippi State, South Carolina, Alabama, Ole Miss. Tigers in a crossroad season and games away from home will be crucial. 5. Tennessee: Florida, Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri. That 10-game losing streak to the Gators adds to the pressure. 6. Florida: Kentucky, Missouri, LSU, South Carolina. A split would be large for new coach Jim McElwain. 7. Auburn: LSU, Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas A\u0026M. That early game against LSU may define the season. 8. Mississippi State: Auburn, Texas A\u0026M, Missouri, Arkansas. Bulldogs had a lot of big games at home last year. 9. Vanderbilt: Ole Miss, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee. Manageable road schedule if Vanderbilt is much improved. 10. Kentucky: South Carolina, Mississippi State, Georgia, Vanderbilt. Wildcats defeated South Carolina last season. 11. South Carolina: Georgia, Missouri, Texas A\u0026M, Tennessee. If Steve Spurrier is going to turn it around, he’ll need some road wins. 12. Texas A\u0026M: Ole Miss, Vanderbilt, LSU. Only three true road games in the conference. 13. Georgia: Vanderbilt, Tennessee, Auburn. And then there’s that game in Jacksonville. 14. Missouri: Kentucky, Georgia, Vanderbilt, Arkansas. Could the East come down to that final road game?

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday is Comic-Con's sucker baby — a day so easy you don't know what everyone was warning you about. We pretty much walked into the infamous Hall H on the first morning of Comic-Con 2015 — no wristbands and little waiting required. But there were already people camped out in line for the next day's panels, the wristbands for which wouldn't get handed out for 12 hours. The first panel of the day was reserved for Open Road, the distributor behind such films as \"Dope\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" With no description in the schedule, most, if not all, of those in attendance were just waiting around for something else later in the day — the \"Hunger Games\" panel or \"Doctor Who.\" When its start time came and went, some in my section speculated that it'd just been canceled. Then Bill Murray entered the room. Open Road used its hour in Hall H to promote \"Rock the Kasbah,\" a comedy in which Murray stars as a rock music manager who discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice in Afghanistan. It co-stars Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan and Danny McBride, but all the movie needs to drum excitement is Murray, and the marketers know that. He entered through the crowd and answered the moderator's first question in character. The name cards on the dais often give away who's on-hand, but his read, \"Richie Lanz.\" In his first-ever Comic-Con appearance, Murray played to the crowd. \"I feel like I fit in,\" he said. \"I feel like I could fall down in any of these aisles right here and be left alone until I woke.\" What followed was a master class in fan appreciation. By turns funny and gracious, he flirted back when one woman offered to let him spend the night with her on the convention-center lawn. He encouraged a young man who was so nervous that his knees were shaking to move the shaking up to his hips and then to his arms; the kid did, dancing in front of thousands. He was philosophical and sincere, greeting even the most awkward and rambling questions with wit and grace. “I must say it feels wonderful to be in this room,” Murray said. “I like when people get excited about something. There’s a lot of people who don’t get excited about much at all.” With no warning that he’d even be there, it’s likely that no one in Hall H on Thursday morning was there to see Bill Murray. And “Rock the Kasbah” isn’t your typical Comic-Con film. But the move got some of the world’s most rabid pop-culture fans some face-time with one of the industry’s most personable stars — and got Open Road’s little movie in front of them.",

    "DiffbotBody": "When Vecernji list saw a need — that readers wanted a venue to run and walk for exercise — the news media company started its own school, the “GoOUT School of Movement.” Here are seven lessons learned from this profitable initiative. At Vecernji, we have directed all of our thoughts to creating new revenue streams in the last several years. We are trying to create a community of fans around our niche media platforms (print and digital platforms) by producing relevant and useful content, which will support and participate in our non-publishing projects. The growing trend among all generations to participate in outdoor activities encouraged us to launch a niche bi-monthly magazine GoOUT and accompanying digital platform 18 months ago, since publishing is still our core business. Analysing the needs of people, we concluded that across all age groups they are most interested in running/jogging and in Nordic walking for the 50+ age group. At the same time, a market analysis showed that sufficient capacity does not exist in clubs or schools to absorb all of this interest. These findings led us to an idea to establish our school, at first only in the capital city of Croatia. That is how the “GoOUT School of Movement” originated as a logical complement to the previously mentioned media platforms. After the initial idea, about which everyone been very enthusiastic (after everyday stresses, most of us the best relaxation finds in running), we were faced with several challenges. We didn’t know anything about organising this kind of school. We didn’t have professional trainers. We didn’t have a location or permits. And, most importantly, we didn’t have an allocated budget. We had to go one step at a time. Initial business plan been made and we found that project could be mostly financed from monthly memberships and the sponsorship of related companies that were interested in reaching this target group/community. For professional assistance, we turned to the Faculty of Kinesiology, with which we reached an agreement in a very short time (much to our very great surprise) – five trainers for the running school and seven trainers for the Nordic walking school. The next step was to select a location and obtain a permit. We selected four locations, in consultation with the professional team of trainers, we designed the programms. Since the programmes involved running and walking, several training programmes for different weight classes, age groups and physical capabilities were set up. Babysitting would be provided in the morning and afternoon periods at two locations for the children of parents who were running or walking. This service was a unique offer on the market because no other school had it. We completed all of these preparations in 30 days and were ready to launch our sales effort! We simultaneously started sales to future attendees, exclusively using for promotion all of the media platforms of our house with BTL (below-the-line) activities at the locations — open houses and test trainings —nd to our potential sponsors (multi-vitamin drinks, sportswear, shoes, gadgets, vitamins, etc.). That was in September 2014. The goal was to start the school in November. We knew that it wasn’t the best time of year for outdoor activities, but we still decided to start (if we could get the required money from sponsors and enough potential participants) and to introduce the project by the spring of 2015, when the peak season begins. In the first wave, we concluded two-year contracts with two main sponsors and we started the school with a 130 attendees, who trained three times a week divided into seven groups and different time periods. In this way we ensured a satisfactory profit after covering the project costs (trainers, baby sitting, T-shirts for the attendees, etc.). Today, the school has around 400 attendees and 21 groups, and our profit margin is growing month by month. In addition to the regular trainings, we have also organised two running races and two Nordic walking excursions in the mountains, open to anyone who is interested. Revenues from the registration fees for these events and the revenues from smaller/one-time sponsors are “icing on the cake” within P\u0026L. We can now safely our project is a success — with a current profit margin is 60%. At a time when all media companies, or at least a majority of them, are faced with a constant decline in classic revenues, we have learned that a good project without an allocated budget can still be launched and create extra profit for a company. For us, the definition of a good project means several things: To create a community of readers by quality content around niche media platforms. To recognise the needs of that community and to find empty space on the market. To create additional services or products that satisfy those needs an charge them. To maximise existing resources and to gather a team (project management, marketing, sales) to launch and implement a project that believes in its success. To constantly add new elements to a project that will in the long term keep the existing users and attract new ones. To create unique environment for potential sponsors based on the needs of the target group. To optimise costs and for promotion to use only our own media platforms if the portfolio provides sufficient reach, as in our case. (Small niche publishers can try to link up with larger media companies on a revenue-sharing principle in exchange for media space). Preparations for the next season have already begun. We will organise even more extra events, and the school can perhaps start to operate in other larger cities across the country. We are certain that new successes are coming!

Deveaux delivered a two-handed slash to the ankle of defenceman Per Helmersson during the pre-game warm-up of a Swedish professional hockey league game. (Richard Wolowicz/Getty Images) Former Toronto Maple Leafs enforcer Andre Deveaux has been exonerated by Swedish authorities for his attack on an opposing player earlier this year. Prosecutors had considered charging Deveaux after he delivered a two-handed slash to the ankle of defenceman Per Helmersson during the pre-game warm-up of a Swedish professional hockey league game. 'I was always confident that this investigation would go nowhere. It was unwarranted, particularly given the facts.'- Former Swedish hockey player Andre Deveaux \"I fully co-operated with authorities throughout this entire ordeal, despite the unfair process and inaccurate reporting by the Swedish media,\" Deveaux said in a statement Friday, referring to reports from Swedish media that incorrectly said a warrant had been put out for his arrest. \"I am happy that the prosecutor made the right decision today.\" Deveaux, who played for Rogle BK, told Canadian reporters in early May that he had been threatened by players on Helmersson's team, VIK Vasteras HC. He said he was simply protecting himself when he took the action he did. \"I was always confident that this investigation would go nowhere,\" said Deveaux. \"It was unwarranted, particularly given the facts. I now look forward to Rogle BK living up to their obligations. \"My wife, Anya, and I are grateful for the outpouring of support we have received in Canada.\" Helmersson had checked Deveaux into the boards from behind in the previous game between the two teams, resulting in Deveaux sustaining a concussion. No penalty was called on the play. The Swedish Ice Hockey Association suspended Deveaux until Feb. 15, 2016, a decision he is appealing. Deveaux has spent most of his career in the minors. In 31 NHL games for Toronto and the New York Rangers, he recorded zero goals, two assists and 104 penalty minutes. In just 20 games with Rogle, he collected 67 penalty minutes, along with six goals and three assists.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Jamie Womack's Friday schedule looked something like this: six back-to-back meetings starting at 7:30 a.m., without a moment for a bathroom break. But around noon, while many Chicago cubicle dwellers gazed longingly out the window, Womack and many of her colleagues at CareerBuilder called it a day. Summer hours, a perk the company offers during July and August, had officially kicked off — and Womack planned to spend Friday afternoon, generally \"a pretty unproductive time\" at the office anyway, getting a haircut and getting home early to spend time with her two sons. \"That Friday morning becomes that much more productive because you're trying to get everything done in a half day,\" said Womack, vice president of marketing at CareerBuilder. Chicago-based CareerBuilder is among a minority of companies with formal policies allowing their employees to shorten their workweeks during the summer, a benefit managers say boosts morale and retention in an era when flexible work schedules have become an increasingly sought-after benefit. In an annual survey, the Society for Human Resources Management found that the flexibility to balance work and life was very important to job satisfaction for 55 percent of employees last year, up from 45 percent the previous year. And among workers who plan to stay at their jobs, work-life flexibility was the second-most cited reason for staying, after pay. Yet only 14 percent of employers nationwide offer seasonal scheduling like summer hours, a share that has been consistent over the past five years, according to a recent survey by the trade group, which polled 463 human resources professionals. Other surveys suggest the practice could be on the rise: About 21 percent of organizations plan to offer their employees early Friday exits or other flexible work hours this summer, while 12 percent actually extended the benefit in 2012, according to CEB, a business research and advisory firm that polled 200 human resources leaders over the past two months. (It should be noted that intentions are often loftier than reality: 30 percent of companies intended to offer it in 2012, and less than half actually did.) Brian Kropp, human resources practice leader at CEB, said that employers without summer hours \"are still missing an opportunity to improve employee engagement and to demonstrate their appreciation for employees' efforts in a low-cost way.\" But some research suggests they may not be all they're cracked up to be. A 2012 study by Captivate Network, a digital media company, found that 53 percent of employees who left early on Fridays during the summer reported a drop in their productivity, and 23 percent who made up for those short days by working longer Monday through Thursday reported increased stress levels. That exacerbates general sluggishness during the summer, when productivity slips 20 percent, attendance dips 19 percent and distraction soars 45 percent, the survey said. Talk to Chicago-area companies with summer hours, however, and you get a much different story. At CareerBuilder, where all 2,146 employees in its North American offices are encouraged to leave at noon on summer Fridays, the policy was first implemented five years ago as a morale booster when the down economy made for tough times at the recruiting firm, Womack said. But as employees shared news of the perk on their social networks, \"we kept it because honestly it became social proof that we care about our employees,\" she said. Unlike some companies that require employees to log longer hours on other days to compensate for an early Friday exit — making for more of a shifted workweek than a shortened one — CareerBuilder pays people for 40 hours even if they only work 35. There were initially concerns about whether shorter hours would allow the company to properly service clients, but it has received no negative feedback from clients, and teams ensure that there is coverage if necessary so customers aren't left in a lurch, said Jade Augustine, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder North America. \"We really empower the employees to manage their time,\" Augustine said, and there is motivation to be particularly efficient the rest of the week to guarantee an early escape. \"If at any point it feels as though it's not being managed properly, the manager is there to work with them.\" Employees were skeptical at first that they could really leave early without penalty, Augustine said, so managers were encouraged to head to doors at noon to set an example, even if it meant taking unfinished work home or to the coffee shop around the corner. \"We tell (managers), even if you are working, do it not here so that people don't think you're still here,\" Augustine said. Now, she said, it's rare to find anyone at their desks Friday afternoons. While the impact of summer hours is difficult to measure, Augustine said they are a popular selling point for recruiters when they talk to prospective candidates, and the perk ranks highly in the annual employee engagement surveys. At Morningstar, which offers summer hours between Memorial Day and Labor Day in the U.S. and some variance of the policy in other countries, employees are still expected to work a full 40-hour week, but they can shift the work so they take off Friday afternoon, said Bevin Desmond, head of human resources and global markets. The malleability fits into the investment company's general trust-based time-off policy, she said. Morningstar employees don't get a set number of sick days or vacation days but are given guidelines (average vacation time: three weeks) and trusted to do what's best for them. Morningstar introduced summer hours at least 15 years ago on a team-by-team basis, but five years ago it made it a companywide policy for consistency, Desmond said. It looks different for everyone: At least half of Chicago employees are gone after lunchtime Friday, others stay until 2 p.m., and some teams that are more tied to a schedule or need to be accessible, like a product support team or public relations, make sure someone sticks around. \"It's definitely something everyone looks forward to,\" Desmond said, particularly in Chicago, where \"it's so lovely in the summer compared to the rest of the year.\" The summer hours policy at Omron Automation and Safety, an industrial automation company with U.S. headquarters in Hoffman Estates, has been so positive that this year they started it in June rather than July, said Marc Klemencic, human resources manager for the U.S. division. The policy, in place until Labor Day, allows employees to work one 4-hour day per week if they work 9-hour days the other four days, he said. The shortened day can be any chunk of time on any day. The company doesn't allow people to work 10-hour days to take a whole day off. The policy requires some oversight by managers to ensure their entire department isn't off at the same time. Omron started the policy about five years ago when \"we saw there was a shift in the working parent\" and a greater desire for work-life balance, particularly in the summer when families take vacation, Klemencic said. He said it has been a good recruiting tool, productivity has not dropped, and it has contributed to an average 7.5-year employee tenure with the company and a turnover rate of less than 10 percent. \"Companies want productivity, but productivity doesn't mean anything if you don't have a happy workforce,\" Klemencic said.

    "DiffbotBody": "The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office reported the following incidents: POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL DRUG: On June 25, a deputy was patrolling Clacktown Road when he noticed a female passenger in a white Chevrolet van not wearing a seatbelt. The deputy noticed the van as one belonging to a wanted person and when he pulled the van over, the male driver and male passenger got out and ran away. The deputy did not follow the two as the 33-year-old woman was still in the car. Also inside the car were multiple controlled substances and paperwork that belonged to the wanted person. The woman, Jessica May Dyer, was arrested for multiple charges, including illegal possession of controlled substances. BURGLARY: On June 28, a deputy was dispatched to Will Maynard Road where a family’s house was broken into and more than $25,000 of their belongings stolen. The husband said he returned home at 2:30 p.m. to find his basement door was broken into and noticed several guns and some jewelry missing. Stolen items include a $4,000 Browning shotgun and a $3,000 gold wedding ring and some items were recovered later in the day. The family’s son and daughter were home when the burglary occurred and the daughter said she saw someone outside, but assumed it was her brother walking the dog and went to bed. THEFT: On June 30, a deputy was dispatched to Poplar Way in Winder where a woman said all of her belongings except for her pots and pans were stolen from her house. The woman told police she was arrested three days prior for simple assault against her boyfriend and upon returning home, she found the items missing. The victim said the two men living in her house took the property after she was taken to jail. Stolen items include a 65-inch television, two iPhones, tools, a bike, two diamond rings, a box containing gold jewelry and all of the food in her refrigerator, totaling to $3,200. CARD THEFT: On June 30, a deputy was dispatched to Nunnally Road Southeast where a woman said someone stole her purse from her car and used her credit cards. The victim told police she left her car unlocked between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m. and noticed her purse, which contained her $300 car key, driver’s license and seven financial cards, was stolen. When she checked her Bank of America account, she found someone had withdrawn $360 cash from her account. The victim suspended the account. CAR THEFT: On June 30, a deputy was dispatched to North Jackson Street where a man said his truck was stolen. The victim showed police his video surveillance footage of a man hiding behind cars in his driveway at 5:51 a.m. The man unlocked the Ford F-350 King Ranch, gets in and backs out of the driveway. The truck was valued at $75,000 and a laptop inside the truck was valued at $500. THEFT: On July 6, a deputy met with a woman who said a man took her money to replace her air conditioner and has not shown up to replace it. The victim told police she paid the man $1,900 on June 24 to buy the new unit and have it installed. The victim called the man to ask why he had not arrived and he said his fiancé was pregnant and hospitalized with pregnancy complications. She said the man has not answered her calls since. FORGERY: On July 6, a deputy was dispatched to an Wal-Mart in Winder where a woman tried to use 10 counterfeit $100 bills. The deputy noted how the counterfeit dollars had five subtle differences from the $100 bills the company provided. The 53-year-old female suspect, Teresa Stephens, was able to provide a total of 91 counterfeit $100 bills when the deputy asked for them. Stephens said she received the money in the mail from a man in Illinois. She went to Walmart to send $950 to her Nigerian friend. Stephens was charged with forgery and theft by deception.

    "DiffbotBody": "STAMFORD — By all accounts, the Ridgefield 12-year old Little League team sports one of the most dangerous lineups in the District 1 tournament, needing no help to succeed, but when given a few extra outs to play with they make the opposition pay. Ridgefield twice struck out with two outs in the second inning, but both batters reached base on wild pitches, extending the inning and allowing the bats to get going. And they got going in a big way, busting out for nine runs in the second inning on the way to an 11-6 victory over Weston in the District 1 Little League double-elimination tournament at Springdale Little League Field in Stamford Friday evening. With the win, Ridgefield moves on in the winner’s bracket while Weston falls into the loser’s bracket where it will next play an elimination game Saturday against Wilton. Ridgefield coach Jeff Lacoille said the extra few chances in the second inning were a blessing to his team. “That was huge and we had a nice breakout inning,” Lacoille said. “I kind of made some mistakes out there early and they picked me up.” That breakout inning featured home runs by Johnny Briody and Jake Bongo with eight of the nine Ridgefield batters scoring in the inning and Bongo coming around twice in the frame. For Ridgefield, Bongo scored twice and had 2 RBI; Briody had 2 RBI and a double to go with his home run; Alex Hanna was 2 for 4 with two runs and a RBI and Luke Barrientos drove in two runs on the evening. Weston coach Seve Esposito said at this stage in the tournament it is tough to win when making mistakes. “We can’t do that,” Esposito said. “We are like a dark horse in this tournament because we have never gotten this far but we have done that by making no mistakes. When you start giving up 3, 4, 5 outs an inning that’s how it happens.” For Weston, Myles Lehrman was 4 for 4 with two doubles and two runs scored; Evan Levine had a home run, double and 5 RBI and Alex Olsen hit a home run and scored three runs as Weston chipped away at the lead but could not whittle it down. Weston led 2-0 in the second with Levine plating two runs with a double. Weston added a run in the fourth on Olsen’s home run and three more in the sixth on Levine’s blast. Ridgefield tacked on two more runs in the fifth, padding the lead with runs driven in by Jack Gonzalez and Diego Pepe. Ridgefield 11, Weston 6 Batteries: R - Jack Bohrer, Andrew Forsyth (2, W), Johnny Briody (4), Luke Barrientos (6) and Jason Hartnett.

    "DiffbotBody": "You don't have to pay for expensive professional treatments to reduce the appearance of deep wrinkles around your mouth. You can make a few lifestyle changes or try natural or over-the-counter remedies to get rid of deep skin wrinkles. The treatments may take a bit of effort, but you'll save money and avoid time-consuming and possibly painful visits to the dermatologist. Lifestyle Changes MayoClinic.com states that smoking can create deep wrinkles around your mouth and speed up your skin's natural aging process. Stop smoking to prevent deep wrinkles from forming or getting worse. Sun exposure can also lead to wrinkles around your mouth. If you go out in the sun, apply sunblock to your face to prevent the sun's ultraviolet rays from worsening your wrinkles or creating new wrinkles around your mouth.",
    "LabBody": "Exercises. One of the most affordable ways to get rid of deep wrinkles around your mouth is to perform face-tightening exercises. The Genius Beauty website recommends standing in front of the mirror and performing facial exercises for 15 minutes every day to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Start by stretching your mouth as wide as you can, as if saying \"cheese.\" Hold the position for two seconds, then pucker your lips together tightly so that your lips almost touch your nose. Hold this pose for two seconds, then stretch your mouth back into the \"cheese\" position. After two seconds, stretch your lips forward and down, as if saying the word \"go.\" Hold for two seconds, then relax. Repeat the entire routine 20 times.",

Contact Colin McNickle (412-320-7836 or cmcnickle@tribweb.com). 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By Jonah Goldberg Friday, July 10, 2015, 8:57 p.m. Poor Donald Trump. It wasn't supposed to be like this. For years, wherever The Donald went, he met people who told him he should run for president. His retinue of sycophants surely saw little to gain from explaining that “birthers,” celebrity worshippers and devotees of “The Apprentice” are not a statistically meaningful sample of the electorate. In the past, Trump always pulled back from the brink. Why risk his beloved TV show? Why endure the embarrassment of revealing he's not as rich as he pretends? Flirt but don't commit was the rule. But something changed. One too many Twitter followers said, “Do it!” One too many valets whispered, “America needs you” — probably just before asking for a raise. And Trump took the leap — though he hasn't provided the required financial disclosures yet, which inclines me to think that he will either suddenly find an excuse to retreat or that he has a team of accountants trying to figure out how he can simultaneously save face and avoid perjury. In his announcement speech — the brevity and discipline of which were impressive only by the standards of Fidel Castro or Joe Biden — Trump shouted his certainty that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals to America, but he could only “assume” (sotto voce) that “some” of those Mexicans are good people. Trump's commitment to the GOP has often been situational. Sure, he has put his money where his mouth is, but he's as promiscuous with his mouth as he is with the Trump brand. He's given money to Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Andrew Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and the Clinton Foundation. Asked to explain why, he said, “You're gonna need things from everybody.” (One does wonder what Trump hoped to get from the Clinton Foundation.) This attitude helps explain why Trump is such a fan of eminent domain. The man seeking the tea party's support loves to use the government to seize private land he can't — or doesn't want to — buy fairly. Given the fetid swamp of sanctioned corruption that passes for commerce in New York, it's no wonder he sees nothing wrong with greasing the skids by funding liberal politicians. The great irony is that the man who made his fortune playing the game of influence-peddling and celebrity-mongering forgot that the other players get a turn. Trump has lost his TV show. Macy's will no longer carry his menswear. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who governs like a banana republic demagogue, has declared that he is reviewing Trump's contracts with the city. Meanwhile, too many of Trump's GOP primary competitors, afraid of angering his fans, stand mute or mumbling. Republicans are fielding the best candidates in a generation, but Trump is poised to make them chumps by association. He has no chance of becoming president, but he has the huge potential to deny his alleged party a White House victory in 2016. And when that happens, he will of course stay a celebrity, but he will have traded his fame for infamy, even among those now cheering him on.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, \"You have heard that our ancestors were told, 'You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.' But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court.

And you know that murderers don't have eternal life within them.\" The word used here for hate means \"to habitually despise.\" It is not just a transient emotion of the affections but a deep-rooted loathing. We all lose our temper at times. I don't think the Bible is saying that if you get angry and honk at someone, then you are a murderer. No, you are just a honker, and maybe you shouldn't have lost your temper. The hatred the Bible is speaking of here is a deep-rooted loathing. It's an attitude that says, \"I hate your guts.

    "DiffbotBody": "\"You shall not steal.\" — Exodus 20:15 There is so much stealing in our culture today that we have almost become accustomed to it. In fact, I read about a study that was done on stealing in which people were asked why they didn't steal. The number one reason given by those polled was the fear of getting caught. The next most common reason was concern that the other person might try to get even. The third most-cited reason was that the item might not be needed. What apparently didn't occur to anyone was the fact that stealing is a sin. Here is what God says about stealing: \"Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need\" (Ephesians 4:28). In the above verse we find three simple principles about how to live our lives as Christians. First, if you have stolen, steal no longer. Don't take something that doesn't belong to you. Don't illegally download stuff. Don't take things that are not yours. If you have taken something, give it back or make restitution. Second, be useful. Get out and work. Get a job. The apostle Paul said in 2 Thessalonians 3:10, \"For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat.\" The government doesn't owe you anything. Don't leech off people. Go out and be responsible and look for a job. Third, be useful. Find work wherever you can find it. Do something. Make an effort. Sometimes people who are out of work will say, \"I am praying the Lord will provide.\" That's good to pray. But have they submitted your resume anywhere? Have they applied for any jobs? Keep praying.

The world's top smartphone maker will launch a new version of its Galaxy Note phablet in mid-August, the person said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Previous versions, such as the Note 3 and 4, typically launched in September. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment. The mid-August launch will likely put the new Note smartphone model on the market ahead of arch-rival Apple Inc's next iPhones. The U.S. company is preparing for its largest initial production run for new phones so far by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Samsung is seeking to rebound from a disappointing 2014, when its annual profit hit a three-year low as smartphone earnings slumped. Though Samsung's earnings are recovering, its second-quarter guidance of a 6.9 trillion won ($6.11 billion) operating profit fell short of market expectations following a supply shortage for the curved-screen version of its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone. \"I don't know how much the earlier launch will help boost the company's average selling price for smartphones, but this suggests that Samsung will work hard to maintain its market share for the high-end market,\" said HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon.

She looks amazing and would bring a more exotic touch to Dior if she were to be chosen as brand ambassador. Getty There's no denying Denise Bidot is gorgeous, and this Latina has a classic elegance to her that could perfectly fir Dior's standards. And, if she were to be a Dior girl, not only would she be the first Latina, but she would also be the first plus size model to be part of the fashion house. Getty Rihanna has yet another accomplishment under her belt. The Barbadian beauty is the latest ambassador for Dior, making her the first black woman to be the face of such iconic fashion house. She had been spotted at the Palace of Versailles a while ago in a silver sequined dress filming what turned out to be the Secret Garden campaign.

    "DiffbotBody": "The Heritage Council made a submission in 2001 calling for a bigger buffer between the Belhus historic precinct and residential development. Photo: Anita McInnes The state government has ignored a 2001 Heritage Council submission, which called for more protection of the heritage-listed Henry Bull's Cottage from urbanisation. Last month, Heritage Minister Albert Jacob and the Heritage Council were quizzed on whether the Heritage Council had made a submission on Henry Bull's Cottage (Lot 106), or the Belhus historic precinct in general, in relation to Stockland's Vale development in Aveley. The Heritage Council said it did not receive a referral from the WA Planning Commission nor did it make a submission, as the Vale development did not share a boundary with the state-registered Henry Bull's Cottage and did not have any physical impact on the cultural significance of the place. Mr Jacob did not respond. Since then, Echo News obtained a copy of the Western Australian Planning Commission's metropolitan region scheme amendment No. 1020/33 Egerton Estate, Ellenbrook dated August 2003. In it there is a late submission (dated November 21, 2001) by the Heritage Council to the WAPC secretary Paul Stephens. The submission, signed by then-director Ian Baxter, said that \"in conjunction with a reduction in the area of the proposed urban zone, a permanent buffer zone in the form of a parks and recreation reservation [should] be imposed between the proposed urban zone and Lot 106\". The submission also said \"Given the close proximity of Egerton Estate, Ellenbrook to a registered place, it is a concern that this matter was not referred to the Heritage Council by the WAPC prior to the closing of public submissions\". State Heritage Office executive director Graeme Gammie said Mr Baxter had provided comments on the amendment. Mr Gammie said there was no reference in the documentation for amendment No.1020/33 in 2001 to Stockland's Vale development. \"There was no subsequent referral to the Heritage Council in relation to the subdivision of the land, the form of development or the landscape and infrastructure that make up the Vale estate, which was recommended by the City of Swan and endorsed by the WAPC on November 26, 2013,\"he said. \"As part of his 2001 submission, Mr Baxter supported a recommendation by the Environmental Protection Agency, WAPC's eastern districts planning committee and the Swan Valley Planning Committee that in order to minimise the potential for any adverse impact on the Heritage Listed site at Lot 106 by the proposed MRS Amendment, a permanent buffer zone should be established between the proposed urban zone and Lot 106. \"We understand that there is now a designated conservation category wetlands site between the two areas.\" Henry Bull's Cottage owner Jerry Horgan said to the best of his knowledge there was no designated conservation category wetlands between the historic precinct and the new development. \"It is not listed on any of the title documents relating to our property,\" he said. \"On the other hand, it may refer to the land on the upstream side of the dam or they could be referring to the land downstream of the historic precinct. \"This is the open area along the Ellen Brook downstream of the convict bridge.\" Belhus Rural Protection Group spokeswoman Susan Hall said it was disappointing the Heritage Council's earlier submission had been ignored. Mrs Hall said the proposed urban zone had not been reduced and was now only metres from Cruse's flour mill, marri trees, which had been there when Europeans first arrived in the area, had been cut down and instead of a park and recreation reserve being installed that area had been treated as urban public open space and would be occupied by a drainage swale.

    "DiffbotBody": "China (/ˈtʃaɪnə/; simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state located in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims the territories governed by Taiwan, a separate political entity officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), as its 23rd province, a claim which is controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas. The history of China goes back to the ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei. China had the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it as seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2013, it is the world's second-largest economy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), and is also the world's largest exporter and importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defence budget.

    "LabBody": "Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas. China is considered a cradle of civilization, with its known history beginning with an ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2800 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the surrender of the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei. China had the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2014, it is the world's second-largest economy by nominal total GDP and largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defence budget. The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BCIM and the G-20. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower by a number of commentators.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. These haters on the Republican side will not be pleased with a new poll that has revealed Trump is the top GOP challenger in North Carolina. According to Conservative Tribune, Trump topped the poll with a whopping 16% of the vote. Jeb Bush and Scott Walker tied for second with 12% and Mike Huckabee came in right behind them with 11%. The poll was conducted by the Democrat-leaning Public Policy Polling found that Trump’s surge was due mostly to an increasing favorability rating among men and young people. “Trump’s favorability rating in North Carolina is 55/32, much higher than we were finding in national polls prior to his entry into the race,” PPP’s report said. “Trump’s really caught fire with voters on the far right — 66% of ‘very conservative’ voters see him favorably to only 24 percent with a negative view of him. Trump is polling particularly well with younger voters (29 percent) and men (20 percent).” They added that Trump’s numbers are being boosted by conservative independents in particular. “Among ‘very conservative’ Republicans, only 37 percent see him favorably to 44 percent who have a negative opinion of him and only 7 percent of those voters support him for the nomination, putting him in seventh place in the GOP field,” PPP continued. The PPP found that Hillary Clinton still has the lead among Democrats in North Carolina, with her polling in at 55%. However, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her with 20% of the vote. Are you a Trump supporter? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.",

A large explosion struck outside the Italian Consulate in Egypt’s capital Cairo early Saturday, severely damaging the building and killing one civilian, and injuring four others, officials said. An Italian diplomat said the consulate was closed at the time and no staff members were wounded in the blast. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil) A huge explosion occurred in front of the Italian consulate in central Cairo on Saturday, wounding two policemen, state news agency MENA said. The cause of the blast was not immediately clear but one security official said it was a car bomb. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. MENA cited a senior security source as saying preliminary investigations indicated that attackers had placed a bomb underneath a car near the consulate and remotely detonated it. MENA earlier cited a security source as saying two policemen were wounded in the attack. Islamist militants have carried out roadside bombs and suicide bombing attacks which have so far targeted members of the security forces and officials. The violence, and political turmoil triggered by the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, have hurt Egypt’s tourism industry, a pillar of the economy. Media reports said an Egyptian was wounded by the blast. The blast occurred early in the morning on a weekend during the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan – a time of day when there is little congestion.

    "DiffbotBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway. Separately, P\u0026G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P\u0026G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P\u0026G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P\u0026G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter \u0026 Gamble shareholders could exchange P\u0026G shares for shares of Coty. P\u0026G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P\u0026G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P\u0026G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P\u0026G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P\u0026G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P\u0026G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. “This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,” Lafley said. “We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.” Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P\u0026G’s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal “is a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,” said Ali Dibadj, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. “The timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,” Dibadj told me. “Feels a little amateurish in terms of process by P\u0026G.” The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger, an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. “Sales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P\u0026G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,” Strebinger told me. The brands that P\u0026G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P\u0026G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P\u0026G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head \u0026 Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. “Procter \u0026 Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we’d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,” Erin Lash, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. “However, we don’t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.” The beauty category “has remained a challenge for P\u0026G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,” Lash wrote. “We suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.” The other brands included in P\u0026G’s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice \u0026 Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. acted as financial adviser on the transaction, and Cadwalader, Wickersham \u0026 Taft LLP acted as tax counsel. Jones Day acted as legal counsel, and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P\u0026G.",

    "DiffbotBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J. She began working for museums in earnest in 2002 when she became administrator of the Readington museums, where she oversaw three 18th-century buildings depicting Colonial life in New Jersey farming communities. Hollander helped with several restoration efforts and spent a great deal of her time making history accessible to the public. She developed Hands-on History programs centered on themes such as health and hygiene in the Colonial era and traditional crafts such as barrel-making. She would also take on the persona of Vrouw Maritje Bouman, a 36-year-old mother of five in the Colonial era. Donning a white bonnet, embroidered apron and red linen bedjacket, Hollander would tell school groups what life was like in 1755 as she performed daily chores. \"I would show them that I was cooking on a hearth and ask them if they help their moms cook on a hearth,\" she recalled. \"They would say we don't have a hearth. We have a stove. I would ask them what is it? How did it get hot? Wood? Most didn't know, but by asking them questions, if forced them to think about their world.\" Hollander played the part so seriously that a student once stopped her on the street to tell her she looked just like Vrouw Bouman and ask if she was her descendant. \"She got the kids to appreciate history,\" said Margaret Smith, program director at Readington. Hollander kept their attention, she said, through hands-on activities and stories. Hollander left Readington in 2010 when the board made her job part-time and soon after started working at Clinton's Red Mill Village. With 40,000 artifacts and a 10-acre campus along the scenic south branch of the Raritan River, the mill is well suited for exhibits and special events. Hollander tapped that potential, hosting Civil War Days and Revolutionary Days, weekend festivals that featured re-enactors. She also got a quick lesson in crisis management there. The Halloween before she was hired, the nonprofit that runs the mill had transformed the historic spot to the Asylum of Terror, haunted by \"wretched souls\" tormented by \"dementia, paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviors, physical abnormalities and deformities.\" The theme drew criticism from the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma and prompted the National Alliance on Mental Illness to alert the public about the Clinton mill. Mill officials approved a safer \"zombie\" theme the year Hollander came on board and issued a public apology in the newspaper. The board would have left it at that had it not been for Hollander, said Pat Bower, a former mill board member. Hollander reached out to the alliance and the council, creating a history exhibit on how the state had treated the mentally ill. \"She used it as an opportunity to highlight the issue and engage public discussion,\" Bower said. Hollander said some didn't want the exhibit to include the state's mistreatment of the mentally ill and the prejudices held against people with mental illness. But Hollander was insistent that a full story be told, and that the mill was the right place to tell it. \"You can't learn to do things right if you don't recognize the things that happened in the past,\" she said. Hollander left Clinton three years ago for a job as assistant director of communications and outreach at the New Jersey regional office at American Jewish Committee, an advocacy nonprofit. There, she said, she learned about building connections with people and partnerships to advance a cause. Considering just a third of the National Museum of Industrial History's budget will be covered by museum tickets, she said building partnerships — in the form of sponsors, grants and memberships — will be key. She also learned at AJC that history is more significant to people if you can show its impact on people today. She believes she can do that at the National Museum of Industrial History by showing how the machines and innovations that built America continue to have an impact on the world. And here, she'll also have an opportunity to develop programs that inspire the next generation. \"That's where the truly, truly open minds are,\" Hollander said. \"To them, the sky's the limit, anything can happen.\" It takes, she said, just one historical figure, artifact or idea to inspire a future. Just as Grover's Mill did for her.

That's how many spaces Paul Frost looked at over the course of year while trying to set up his first solo venture, a globally inspired sandwich shop he dreamed up while working at places as diverse at Tangerine, Chifa, Kanella and the Talamore Country Club. Eventually, the Restaurant School grad settled on the cozy red-brick building on the corner of Front and Morris formerly occupied by BYOB Langostino. Done in white vinyl lettering, the catchy logo caught my attention, made me pull over and stare into the windows like a kid peering into a candy store. South Philly isn't short on great sandwich shops, but they don't happen to be concentrated in Pennsport, a neighborhood I'm constantly passing through. Frost opened 1st Ward in early June with a menu of riffs on between-bread classics like po' boys and grilled cheese —\"all things I used to make for staff meal,\" he says — plus salads, soup and sides. When I popped in for an early dinner after a biblical thunderstorm, it looked sunny despite the gray skies: soft ash floors, picture windows, white wainscoting, local art. But the fried cauliflower dish, tender florets tangy with lemon and sumac, was what really brightened my night. Served with a sidecar of chilled romesco, the perfectly cooked vegetable proved Frost's skill — and 1st Ward's ambition. This isn't your neighborhood hoagie shack. Pork belly braised half a day in hoisin forms the base for the banh mi, one of the two sandwiches I tried. The slices of pork were crispy and gooey in all the right places, their richness balanced by fresh cilantro and threads of house-pickled cucumber and carrot. Washington Avenue diehards might turn up their noses at the lack of pâté, or the predominant sweetness; my only complaint was the lack of fresh jalapeño, which would add a more complex heat than the smear of sriracha mayo. Served open-face on sesame bread, the mozzarella-eggplant sandwich was like a pair of giant bruschetta. Frost made the soft, supple mozz in-house; the wheels of fresh tomato were juicy and sweet, and the crowns of fresh greens streaked in balsamic lent it the vibe of a fresh Italian salad. The grilled marinated eggplant slices bordered on underdone; another minute on the grill, and they would have been perfect. I matched my sandwiches with a cone of slender, skin-on fries (crisp and well-seasoned) and a class-defying spring mix salad furnished with Gorgonzola, dried cherries, candied pumpkin seeds and Dijon vinaigrette. I would go out of my way to eat at 1st Ward again. Fortunately, I don't have to reroute — and soon, that might be the case for sandwich feigns who don't live in South Philly. Frosts hopes to open locations all around the city. This first one is a good start.",

Deputies spotted the motorcycle going at a \"high rate of speed\" on Miracle Strip Parkway around 3:15 a.m. on June 27, according to the arrest report. When a deputy tried to perform a traffic stop near Mary Esther Cutoff, the motorcyclist allegedly sped up from 60 mph to 70 mph. As the deputy was following the motorcyclist, other vehicles on the road were pulling over to the side of the road, the report said. The motorcycle allegedly actively went around the stopped vehicles. The motorcyclist eventually pulled over halfway down in front of the Hurlburt Field flightline, according to the report. The driver, identified as Andrew Wayne Hanks, was detained and deputies found he did not have a motorcycle endorsement. Hanks said he was \"practicing\" on a relative's motorcycle, the report said. He admitted to speeding, but said he was trying to get home and didn't notice the lights and sirens behind him.

    "DiffbotBody": "BEMIDJI—After the website Vevo leaked Saphire Brown's \"Fearless\" music video a few weeks back, word finally spread enough to force her to officially release it Wednesday, two days ahead of schedule. Advertisement Despite the leak, the Bemidji-area country music singer said she saw an even greater reaction after she went to social media to announce the video's release. \"I woke up (Thursday) and there was over 4,000 views, and I was shocked,\" she said. \"I was almost in tears because it was so amazing.\" The song \"Fearless\" is about Gracie Woods, a high school student in Thief River Falls who was diagnosed with cancer four years ago, Brown said. She met Woods last September, and the two ended up joining forces, Brown performing and each of them speaking at high schools across northern Minnesota for Saphire's Courage Campaign. Brown created the campaign several years ago after experiencing bullying in multiple schools when she was younger. Brown said she came up with the idea for the song on a hunting trip with Woods. She said Woods did fearless things such as touching an electric fence and nearly getting knocked down by the kick of the gun. The next day, Brown said she wrote \"Fearless.\" The process is a little backward, according to Brown, since she hasn't released her extended play recording (EP), titled \"Courage,\" or full album before releasing a music video. \"I didn't feel like I had time to do that, and it didn't feel right to me because all of us don't know how much time Gracie has left,\" she said. Woods joined Brown in a professional photo shoot by Kevin White and the shooting of the \"Fearless\" video, produced by Bemidji High School graduate Harlan Hegna. \"It's over and beyond what I expected,\" Brown said about the video. \"...Harlan, he saw my vision in my head of this crazy 'Let's do this music video in less than 30 days,' and he just made everything happen.\" Moving forward, Brown said the pace is only going to quicken. \"I guess my next step is to release my EP,\" Brown said. \"And then after that my goal is to hit 20 schools from September to January before I leave for Nashville.\" Even though specific plans are in question, Brown described Nashville as \"a big ball of opportunity,\" and she said she can't wait to get there. Brown's next performance is at 4 p.m. Saturday at the Beltrami County Relay for Life event in Bemidji. To see the video and for more about Brown, visit www.saphirebrownofficial.com.",

Police said they responded to a call of shots fired around 7 p.m. and found the man in the street. He had been shot multiple times and was pronounced dead on the scene, police said. It was the second shooting in the city within a short time. Around 6:30 p.m., a man was shot in the leg in the 2200 block of Bienville Street, police said.

    "DiffbotBody": "Reviews are beginning to trickle in for Mobile Orchestra, the just-dropped new album from Owl City, Minnesota's biggest contemporary pop export. And if you're Owatonna-bred Adam Young, the force behind Owl City, you might need some extra hugs from those 10,000 lightning bugs, because initial appraisals of Mobile Orchestra are, well, brutal. In its two-star review, the Guardian says Young \"makes music so bland and textureless that it should carry a health warning.\" Young writes \"lyrics that could make a motivational speaker seem suicidally depressed,\" says the New York Daily News in its two-star review. Stereogum really goes for the jugular with its post titled \"10 Worst Crimes Against Music On Owl City’s New Album.\" Among them: \"Every track is the sonic equivalent of a frozen dinner\" and \"Adam Young’s voice is butt.\" USA Today (\"Album of the Week\") and the A.V. Club (C+ review) provided the kindest mainstream takes. With a 51 out of 100 lifetime score score, the cloying, self-infantilizing electro-pop star behind megahits \"Fireflies\" and \"Good Time\" is one of the worst-reviewed artists in Metacric history — we're talking Nickelback/Ashlee Simpson/Hoobastank/Ja Rule territory. His branding, earnest or otherwise, has not shielded him from critical scorn. Looking past the bashful choirboy persona, it's easy to detect more than a little pandering in the Owl City formula, one that's being marketed with demographic-specific precision via three new singles. The club-y, Aloe Blacc-featuring \"Verge\" is Hallmark-transparent in its attempt to bilk the download bucks of young graduates; \"My Everything\" is Christian praise music that's sure to become a playlist favorite of church youth groups; and \"Unbelievable,\" featuring '90s throwback act Hanson, is effectively a nostalgia-baiting BuzzFeed listicle set to song. Adam Young's perceived naivete makes honest reviewing feel like bullying. Nobody — save perhaps Bart Simpson — gets joy out of smacking down Rod and Todd Flanders. At the same time, Rod and Todd Flanders aren't putting unforgivable songs like \"Unbelievable\" into the marketplace and banking off of them. There is a crass, calculated careerism to Young, whom we — especially in local media — often forget is a grown-ass, 29-year-old man. In creating \"Good Time,\" for example, this dude straight-face birthed the same condescending pop opiate satirized in Lego Movie with \"Everything Is Awesome,\" zero smirks involved. That's show biz, sure, but Top 40 appeal and tasteful artistry are by no means mutually exclusive. It's standard practice in arts journalism to not bag on the little guy, to avoid savaging questionable artists of minimal consequence just to appease your own critical blood lust. Adam Young may have a song written from the perspective of a honeybee, but he is not the little guy. He is the bankable pop star who's taking the heat he deserves.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A TV show named \"Gunsmoke\" made its debut, and another named \"Make Room for Daddy\" won two Emmys. Elvis Presley and Pat Boone had young hearts all shook up, and for the first time, they could listen to those crooners and others on a new gadget called a pocket transistor radio. A new car cost $1,900, gasoline was 23 cents a gallon and rents averaged $87 a month. It was 1955. On July 17 of that year — a year in which the last occupying troops left Austria and the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series — Disneyland opened its doors. If the first day was any indicator of its future, we might have expected Walt Disney's amusement park to fade into oblivion, much like Georgia Gibbs' No. 1 Billboard hit \"Dance With Me Henry\" did. (Quick, hum a few bars.) The chaos of Disneyland's debut played out in front of a national television audience, and predictions of epic failure abounded. Sixty years later, we know how wrong those naysayers were. With nearly 17 million annual visitors, Disneyland is the biggest draw in California and among the top tourist destinations in the world. The park's drawing power persuaded Disney to build theme parks in Florida, France, Japan and China. Other amusement parks, such as Denmark's Tivoli Gardens, existed, but Disneyland established a modern theme-park template that has been often duplicated but rarely matched. We think we know Disneyland; after all, we've had 60 years to get acquainted. But do we really? Reporters Christopher Reynolds and Brady MacDonald have compiled a list of 60 things you might not know on the diamond anniversary of the theme park that became the gold standard. 1. Much of Disneyland is built to scale to create the illusion of a full-scale experience. The trains circling the park and the Mark Twain Riverboat are built to 5/8 scale. Sleeping Beauty Castle and the storefronts on Main Street, U.S.A., use forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller. 2. More than a million corn dogs are sold annually at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park. L.A. Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold calls the Disneyland corn dog the best he's ever had. 3. The Rivers of America in Frontierland is 4 to 8 feet deep. The first time the man-made river was filled in 1955, the water seeped through the sandy soil. The riverbed was eventually lined with clay to prevent leaking. 4. The Rivers of America held 6.16 million gallons of water the first time it was filled and lost 30,000 gallons a day to evaporation. 5. Maintenance crews dump 12 pounds of green or brown dye into the water a couple of times a week to color the river. 6. The 8- to 15-foot-tall berm that surrounds Disneyland was designed to keep out the real world and keep in the fantasy world. The dirt for the berm came from the excavation of the Rivers of America. Some of the 350,000 cubic yards of excavated dirt was also used to create what would become Tom Sawyer Island. 7. The Disney family crest can be found over the entrance to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The coat of arms was placed above the arch in 1965, about a year before Walt Disney's death. 8. About 84 million Mickey Mouse ears have been sold since 1955. The Mouseketeers first wore the hats in the 1950s on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television show. 9. More than 750 million people have visited Disneyland since opening day. It took just seven weeks for the first million visitors to walk through the gates. Attendance was 3.6 million in 1955-56, its first year of operation. 10. More than 50 scuba divers maintain the water-based attractions and waterways at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. 11. Dream of getting married in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle? You can, but it will set you back $120,000 for an after-hours ceremony. A trip in Cinderella's crystal coach is included, but if you want Mickey and Minnie Mouse to attend, it will cost you an additional $1,425 for a 30-minute visit. 12. Disneyland has a \"jail\" for disruptive guests (Disney-speak for visitors). They're typically held in a security office until Anaheim police arrive. Undercover Disney security officers have been known to watch for shoplifters. 13. No gum is sold at Disney theme parks. Walt Disney didn't want visitors to step in discarded chewing gum. 14. A small lamp remains lighted in the window above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., in memory of Walt Disney. He often stayed overnight in the 500-square-foot apartment during construction of Disneyland. A larger Disney family apartment was later built above New Orleans Square. 15. The apartment above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., includes a dressing area, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a shower. The couches fold out to make additional beds. 16. On opening day, Disneyland contained 800 mostly nonindigenous species of plants from as far away as Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan. 17. More than 12,000 orange trees were removed from the 160-acre plot that became Disneyland. Some of the discarded trees were replanted upside down along the banks of the Jungle Cruise to look like mangrove roots. 18. The route of the Jungle Cruise was laid out with a Jeep outfitted to simulate the length and width of a riverboat. 19. The Mark Twain stern-wheeler, built at a cost of $150,000, was constructed in pieces and assembled at Disneyland. The upper deck was fabricated in Burbank, and the hull was built at a San Pedro shipyard, trucked overnight to the park and lifted by crane into the Rivers of America. 20. Fantasyland's carousel operated at Toronto's Sunnyside Park for decades before being moved to Disneyland in advance of the park's opening. The original carousel featured a menagerie of animals but now has only horses. Additional horses were acquired from other amusement parks. 21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million. 48. In summer 1970, somebody circulated gag fliers proposing a yippie invasion of Disneyland on Aug. 6. On the appointed day, dozens of yippies, or perhaps generic hippies, gathered on Tom Sawyer Island and raised a Viet Cong flag. Management took the rare step of closing the park five hours early, prompting a bold headline (with photos) on the next day's front page of The Times: \"Yippies' Outburst Shuts Disneyland.\" 49. When the park opened, it had both pay and free toilets. Soon after, all bathrooms became free. 50. Walt Disney and author Ray Bradbury were friends. One day at lunch, Bradbury offered to help rebuild Tomorrowland. Disney is said to have replied: \"Ray, it's no use … you're a genius and I'm a genius … after two weeks we'd kill each other!\" Later, Bradbury called it \"the nicest turndown I've ever had.\" 51. By the time It's a Small World opened at Disneyland in 1966, it had already been seen by more than 10 million visitors during its two years at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. 52. Walt Disney had a lot of input into Pirates of the Caribbean, but he died in December 1966, about four months before the ride opened. 53. In 1971, stage psychic the Amazing Criswell predicted that by 1999, Disneyland would be covered by a plastic bubble, its weather controlled by a switch. 54. Though Walt Disney sported a mustache for most of his adult life, Disneyland banned facial hair on its workers from 1957 until 2000, when restrictions were eased. 55. If Disneyland's original $1 adult admission fee had increased in lockstep with the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, today it would be $8.87. Instead, it's $99. (But in the old days, you had to buy ride tickets separately. Now they're included.) 56. In September 1959, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a historic visit to Los Angeles and asked to see Disneyland. His minders first said yes, and then no, after Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker said he couldn't guarantee Khrushchev's safety. \"Why not?\" Khrushchev protested at a public luncheon. \"What is it? Do you have rocket-launching pads there? ... Is there an epidemic of cholera there? … Have gangsters taken hold of the place?\" 57. In Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the Toad Hall library includes these titles: \"For Whom the Toads Croak\" and \"A Tadpole Grows in Brooklyn.\" 58. When it opened in June 1959, Disneyland's monorail was the first daily operating monorail in the Western Hemisphere. 59. Sleeping Beauty Castle is 77 feet tall. Neuschwanstein, the 19th century Bavarian castle that's widely credited as its inspiration, is 213 feet high. (Neuschwanstein, about 80 miles southwest of Munich, Germany, gets 1.4 million visitors yearly.) 60. For height reasons, there's a good chance Mickey Mouse and many other costumed characters are played by female cast members. Male cast members portray the taller characters such as Goofy and Sheriff Woody. Princess characters have strict height requirements: They must be 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall.

Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million.",

(Roger Wilson / Staff Photographer / July 8, 2015) The driver in the fatal crash in a Glendale parking lot Thursday afternoon was identified as an 87-year-old Glendale woman, Los Angeles County coroner’s officials said. The woman, identified by coroner’s officials as Ana Cabot, along with a female passenger, was killed after her car crashed into a concrete pillar in the Ralphs supermarket parking lot, located on the 200 block of North Glendale Avenue. The passenger, also 87, was not identified pending the notification of next of kin, who may be out of the country. The car, an older model Mercedes sedan, was traveling at an unsafe, high rate of speed as it entered the parking lot through the Wilson Avenue entrance, before crashing into the pillar, as well as into two parked cars. Both Cabot and the passenger were pronounced dead at the scene.

    "DiffbotBody": "Hype can be a dangerous thing in fantasy football. Sure, it's great to know who this year's rising stars and hot sleepers are. The problem begins when everyone starts reading the same reports. Writing their own takes based on those reports. Targeting the same players based on what they've read and/or written. That, in turn, drives up the asking price of those sleepers and value plays. A running back who was being drafted close to his fantasy floor rises nearer to his ceiling. That late-round lottery ticket wideout goes from $1 scratcher to one of those big, shiny ones that cost 20 bucks. In 2014, everyone and their mother (hi Mom!) were convinced that San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green was going to take the reins from Antonio Gates. Green's Average Draft Position rose steadily throughout the summer, to the point he was drafted ahead of the future Hall of Famer. Well, Gates caught 12 touchdowns and finished as a top-five tight end in most scoring systems. Green caught 19 passes all season long. With that cautionary tale in mind, here are a handful of players for whom hype levels are redlining in 2015. Begin Slideshow » Average Draft Position: QB4 (37th overall) I will be the first person to admit that I'm an unabashed fan of Seattle Seahawks quarterback . My admiration for him as a player borders on man-crush levels. And Wilson is coming off a phenomenal season, both from an NFL and fantasy football perspective. Wilson set career highs in passing yards (3,475), rushing yards (849) and rushing touchdowns (six) en route to leading the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Wilson also posted the best fantasy finish of his three-year career, finishing fifth at his position in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. With Wilson headed into the final year of his rookie deal, there has been speculation that Wilson could be set to become the highest-paid player in NFL history. Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated might not be willing to go quite that far, but you'll get no argument from him that Wilson's worth a whole lotta money: Is Russell Wilson a franchise quarterback? I would posit that the answer lies somewhere between “Yes” and “Well, duh... of course he is.” He's accomplished things no other quarterback has accomplished through his first three seasons, and while he's had a lot of help, the Seahawks weren't going to win all those games and reach the Super Bowl twice with Tarvaris Jackson, Charlie Whitehurst or Matt Flynn under center. Wilson's asking price has gone way up in fantasy drafts as well. A player who was barely being drafted as a weekly starter a year ago is now going ahead of Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints. And that's no bueno. As things stand right now, fantasy owners are counting on Wilson bettering last year's career stats just to justify his asking price. Not exceed, mind you—justify. And this is a quarterback for the team that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL in 2014. Yes, much of Wilson's fantasy production is tied to his ability to hurt teams with his legs. But consider this—assuming that the Seahawks and Wilson do agree to an extension, do you think the team that just invested well over $100 million in Wilson is going to want him to carry the ball 118 times in 2015? Wilson's a great young player and a fine fantasy option. But with a top-five sticker price? Pass. Average Draft Position: RB20 (44th overall) You aren't going to get any argument that Todd Gurley is a talented, young running back. You won't get much that he's the best rookie ball-carrier to come down the pipe in some time. Mike Mayock of the NFL Network lauded the Rams' selection of Gurley with the No. 10 overall pick, comparing the 6'1\", 221-pounder to Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks: I like the Marshawn Lynch comparison. St. Louis wants to win games the same way that Seattle and San Francisco do in the same division, that is by running the football and playing great defense and special teams. Gurley has Olympic-type speed. I love this pick for St. Louis, which already has a great defense and Gurley will help out Nick Foles. It would appear that fantasy owners agree. Last year, Bishop Sankey of the Tennessee Titans was chosen as the first rookie running back in fantasy drafts, with an average draft position at My Fantasy League of RB25. Gurley is coming off the board a full five slots higher, ahead of veterans like Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers and Joique Bell of the Detroit Lions. There's just one problem—one huge, glaring problem. Gurley tore his ACL last November while at Georgia. Yes, the recovery time for such an injury isn't what it used to be. And reports from Rams' camp have been almost universally positive. However, even if Gurley is ready to rock for Week 1, as Thomas Emerick of Sporting News points out, we're likely to see a lot of second-year pro Tre Mason, at least early in the season: Fisher's approach to managing Gurley's workload will set the ceiling for September and October, where we'll probably see a snap limit and heavy dose of Mason. Gurley owners will hope this step takes place in August. St. Louis also drafted four desperately needed offensive linemen, and this run offense will depend on a young line jelling together and finding starters by fire. With Mason in the fold, there's no reason for the Rams to rush Gurley. And yet he's being drafted like a Week 1 bell cow. Those who pull that trigger better hope it turns out better than Sankey in 2014. Average Draft Position: WR16 (41st overall) There may not be a more hyped player in all of fantasy football than New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Keith Lipscomb of ESPN was one of any number of pundits who have gushed about Cooks' potential as the new No. 1 receiver in the Big Easy: I think the Saints are going to turn up the volume in Cooks' game in his sophomore season. In his first five games, he averaged just 4.1 yards at the catch (how far downfield he caught the ball), but in his final five games before his injury, that number was 12.0. You know the Saints still want to throw the football but don't have their top-two pass-catchers from last season. Cooks is a dynamic talent, and this season he'll get every opportunity to show the masses, including more chances to make plays down the field. It isn't just fantasy types, either. Chris Wesseling of NFL.com also wrote that Cooks could be on the verge of a breakout in his second NFL season: Now that Jimmy Graham and Kenny Stills have been shipped off to Seattle and Miami, respectively, there could be as many as 175-200 targets up for grabs in the Saints' aerial attack. With only a declining Marques Colston ahead of him in the pecking order, Cooks is sure to be a featured player after dominating offseason practices. And it's possible that breakout could happen. Cooks showed himself to be dangerous in the open field last year before a broken thumb ended his season, and with both Stills and especially Graham gone, someone is going to have to pick up the slack. The problem is that with all the buzz surrounding Cooks, his ADP has been steadily climbing. A player with one season of 550 receiving yards is being taken as a high-end fantasy WR2. And for Lipscomb's colleague Field Yates, that cost is just too high: There's a lot to like about Brandin Cooks' game, as he's shifty, elusive and a menace to tackle in open space. But he plays a position -- slot receiver -- that isn't often conducive to finding the end zone frequently. He's slotted as our 16th wide receiver, but I simply think the lack of touchdowns will be an issue from a fantasy perspective. The issue isn't even Cooks per se. It's the hype that's sucked all the value from a player now being drafted far closer to his fantasy ceiling than the floor. Average Draft Position: TE6 (75th overall) OK, so \"hype\" may not exactly be the best word to describe the buzz surrounding Julius Thomas, especially in fantasy circles. In fact, he needs a hug. Evan Silva's comments about Thomas over at Yahoo Sports more-or-less sum up the fantasy community's feelings about Thomas moving to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency this year: Julius Thomas was easily the biggest fantasy \"loser\" of this year's free agency period, going from a Broncos offense that ranked first and second in the NFL in scoring in 2013 and 2014, to a Jags team that finished 32nd and 32nd in those seasons. While Thomas may prove a useful real-life pickup for Jacksonville, the bottom could fall out on his fantasy production. I told you he needed a hug. Although that $9 million a season the Jaguars forked over probably makes the 27-year-old feel a little bit better. If I need to explain to you why going from the fantasy penthouse that is Peyton Manning in Denver to the fantasy outhouse that is Jacksonville and Blake Bortles, then might I recommend fantasy bowling? I hear fantasy cricket is—whatever happens during a cricket jiminy or whatever it's called. And yet Thomas is still being selected sixth at the tight end spot on average. That's ahead of Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles, who could be set for a big uptick in targets this year. Ahead of Jordan Cameron of the Miami Dolphins, who has the added advantage of an honest-to-goodness NFL quarterback throwing him passes in Ryan Tannehill. And far ahead of veteran Owen Daniels, who replaced Thomas in Denver. Have these people seen Bortles and the Jaguars play? Average Draft Position: D/ST1 (68th overall) From an NFL perspective, there's no arguing that the Seattle Seahawks have one of the NFL's very best defenses. In 2014, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. The year before, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. Scoring defense? First in 2014. First in 2013. Two years ago, all was well. The Seahawks also ranked fourth in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. Not great, but nothing to cry about. Last year? Tears galore. The Seahawks free-fell to 23rd. The change was brought about by big plays—or more appropriately, the lack of them. The Seahawks dropped from eighth in the NFL in sacks two seasons ago to 20th in 2014. In 2013, the Seahawks ranked fourth in takeaways. Last year, that number plummeted to 21st. Yes, those numbers could rebound in 2015. Or not. It's not as if the Seahawks made big upgrades to the pass rush in the offseason, and turnovers are a fluky stat. Spending a sixth-round pick (in a 12-team fantasy football league) on any team defense isn't advisable. Spending one on a fantasy defense (that finished outside the top 20 a year ago) because it's a great NFL defense is even worse. It's falling for the hype.

    "DiffbotBody": "The gnats and mosquitos were out in force that mid-June evening at our campsite, as was the Indian paintbrush, the penstemon, globe mallow and other wildflowers whose names I don’t know. The long day’s last light slowly ran its fingers down the sinewy sandstone wave of Comb Ridge to the east, but the June heat persisted. My family and I had just spent several days in the canyons of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, an area that is mostly new to me. Now we were on Cedar Mesa, a place in which I spent a good deal of my youth, and which is now one of the battlefields in the war over what should be done with federal lands in the West. We could see the La Plata Mountains, our “home” range, as well as Lone Cone and Mt. Wilson up by Telluride, a fact that amazed my two daughters. Then they started arguing, because they’re teenagers, about how long it would take to walk back to Durango: A week? Two? And they marveled at how small the world of the Ancestral Puebloans must have been, maybe never leaving this mesa during a lifetime. Actually, I said, their world probably extended at least as far as our view. Out there, just beyond that dark nub known as Shiprock, lies Chaco Canyon. And up here on Cedar Mesa, there are several Chaco “outliers” — pueblos that were linked, by architecture, maybe even Chacoan “roads,” with the massive Great Houses in Chaco Canyon. It would only take a handful of signal fires atop strategically located stone towers to send a quick message from Chaco to here. And Puebloan ultra-runners surely could make the trip on foot in two days. My family retreated behind the bug screen of the tent, but I stayed out in the swarm, sitting cross-legged on a rock, sipping the dregs of a box of wine and watching Earth’s shadow spread across mesa, canyon and the sage plains. The silence was remarkable, interrupted only by the occasional boom of a nighthawk. As stars and lights flickered on in the sky and on the distant landscape, this hardly seemed like a place that’s being “loved to death,” nor one that was in need of protection from industrial invasion. But it is arguably both. For me — and many others — this is personal. My father became aware of Cedar Mesa back when he was growing up in Dolores, Colorado, not far to the east. After that, he came here often, seeking solitude or solace, archaeological sites or hidden pools amongst stone and sage, bringing his family along. As such, it became an important part of my individual creation myth: My earliest memories are of running around on slickrock with my brother, of the smell of piñon burning in the campfire, of seemingly brutal hikes to cliff dwellings nestled high up in a canyon wall. Later, my friends and I headed to Cedar Mesa whenever we got a chance, backpacking into the canyons that didn’t make it into the guidebooks, sometimes getting into trouble in the process — the fodder of stories we still tell today. The area lacked the drama of Canyonlands, but that made it more special. My father was a writer, and Cedar Mesa was often his subject. But he always adhered to an ethic of secrecy, never revealing precisely where it is he wrote about. To do so exposes hidden places, while also robbing folks of the joy of discovery. That ethic has long since perished, killed by Google and blogs, YouTube and Facebook. GPS coordinates of Ancestral Puebloan sites can be found with the flick of a mouse, drawing looters and potsherd-hunters, alike. Websites give precise directions to and detailed descriptions of those canyons that were once blank spots on the guidebooks’ maps, turning even short segments of slots into playgrounds for “canyoneers.” Archaeological sites that were largely ignored for years are now written up by travel writers from the LA Times and other national media. ATV trails have been cut where once were only walking paths. And a designated tar sands area lies under spectacular canyons a couple dozen miles west of where I sat. Environmentalists, historic preservationists and Native American groups have long fought to preserve what’s left, with efforts reaching a crescendo over the last couple of years. Friends of Cedar Mesa, Utah Diné Bikéyah, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and others recently joined up as the Bears Ears Coalition. (The Bears Ears are two buttes that overlook Cedar Mesa and a regional landmark). They’ve proposed putting a huge swath of land, stretching from the San Juan River in the south, encompassing the Abajo Mountains to the north, and reaching almost to Lake Powell in the west, into a national conservation area, with various areas within protected as Wilderness. Under the Diné Bikéyah proposal — which has the support of the Navajo Nation government — the southern portion would be co-managed by the tribe and the feds, in a way similar to Cañon de Chelly in Arizona. Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Rob Bishop’s Public Lands Initiative is attempting to meld the above vision with those of motorized vehicle advocates and state- and county-rights ideologues. Cedar Mesa and surrounding federal lands are in San Juan County, Utah, which has historically resisted federal land agencies. It was the site, last spring, of the Recapture Canyon ATV protest, led by county commissioner Phil Lyman who was recently convicted of federal misdemeanors for the protest. To counter the Bears Ears Coalition, the San Juan Alliance — an ad hoc local group that is decidedly opposed to federal control of their backyard — proposed turning over all BLM and National Park Service land to the state and to the county (e.g. “Canyonlands State Park”). The same week that I sat on Cedar Mesa and contemplated the landscape in question, the San Juan County Lands Council, which includes Lyman and representatives from the Bears Ears Coalition, sent off its compromise proposal to Bishop. While its protections are not nearly as widespread or as robust as those proposed by the Bears Ears Coalition, it does include about a half-million acres of wilderness and was enough to anger the anti-federal land folks. “This will negatively affect the San Juan County cattle and recreation industries and give the federal government even more control over this county,” wrote Monte Wells — who was convicted along with Lyman — on his ThePetroglyph.com Facebook page. “If the county doesn't oppose this entire bill we should thank them and the state for failing to protect our God-given individual rights.” That any of these proposals will be adopted as written is unlikely. But they will surely be used as guides for Bishop and others in congress as they craft Wilderness and other land bills, and by the Obama administration as it considers using executive order to create a national monument here. Less certain is what impact any such designation might have. The abuse of the past — huge swaths of forest “chained” in a futile attempt to create grazing areas, countless roads built to access uranium mines, off-road-vehicle trails spiderwebbing through delicate ecosystems, decades of cattle grazing and pot hunting — can’t be reversed. Meanwhile, monument or wilderness designation will just draw more attention, and visitors, potentially exacerbating the “loved to death” phenomenon. As Earth’s shadow spread across the land that night, I left my perch on the rock and headed toward the tent, ambivalent about these efforts to protect this place. But that ambivalence vanished when I noticed an odd silhouette protruding unnaturally above the shadows of the forest. It was an exploratory oil drilling rig, on the other side of the canyon, on land abutting a Wilderness Study Area. Jonathan Thompson is a senior editor of High Country News.",

That ethic has long since perished, killed by Google and blogs, YouTube and Facebook. GPS coordinates of Ancestral Puebloan sites can be found with the flick of a mouse, drawing looters and potsherd-hunters, alike. Websites give precise directions to and detailed descriptions of those canyons that were once blank spots on the guidebooks’ maps, turning even short segments of slots into playgrounds for “canyoneers.” Archaeological sites that were largely ignored for years are now written up by travel writers from the LA Times and other national media. ATV trails have been cut where once were only walking paths. And a designated tar sands area lies under spectacular canyons a couple dozen miles west of where I sat. Environmentalists, historic preservationists and Native American groups have long fought to preserve what’s left, with efforts reaching a crescendo over the last couple of years. Friends of Cedar Mesa, Utah Diné Bikéyah, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and others recently joined up as the Bears Ears Coalition. (The Bears Ears are two buttes that overlook Cedar Mesa and a regional landmark). They’ve proposed putting a huge swath of land, stretching from the San Juan River in the south, encompassing the Abajo Mountains to the north, and reaching almost to Lake Powell in the west, into a national conservation area, with various areas within protected as Wilderness. Under the Diné Bikéyah proposal — which has the support of the Navajo Nation government — the southern portion would be co-managed by the tribe and the feds, in a way similar to Cañon de Chelly in Arizona. Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Rob Bishop’s Public Lands Initiative is attempting to meld the above vision with those of motorized vehicle advocates and state- and county-rights ideologues. Cedar Mesa and surrounding federal lands are in San Juan County, Utah, which has historically resisted federal land agencies. It was the site, last spring, of the Recapture Canyon ATV protest, led by county commissioner Phil Lyman who was recently convicted of federal misdemeanors for the protest. To counter the Bears Ears Coalition, the San Juan Alliance As Earth’s shadow spread across the land that night, I left my perch on the rock and headed toward the tent, ambivalent about these efforts to protect this place. But that ambivalence vanished when I noticed an odd silhouette protruding unnaturally above the shadows of the forest. It was an exploratory oil drilling rig, on the other side of the canyon, on land abutting a Wilderness Study Area. Jonathan Thompson is a senior editor of High Country News.",

This was the start of a series of articles in De Standaard that lasted for more than three months, discussing the German invasion of Belgium. Tot aan de Ijzer – “to the river de Ijzer” — is a detailed historic reconstruction of what happened when German soldiers invaded Belgium in August, took the major Belgian cities one by one, and were halted around Ypres. The series reported on the invasion, military movements, and political impact. De Standaard also published testimonials of civilians, soldiers, priests, nurses, writers, and the like, shedding a light on how the war was survived by the population.

    "DiffbotBody": "About 15 to 20 residents crowded New Market’s town hall Thursday night to comment and question representatives about the planned development for the 262-acre property, which was annexed into the town in 2014. Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Who is the best player in the ? Not based on the last 10 years or one game, but over the last year: Who was the best? Good luck answering that one without starting a fight, right? Well, that's what the NFL 1000 aims to do by scouting, grading and then ranking the best players at each position before putting them in order and breaking ties to come up with the top 1,000 players. No narratives, no fantasy football points, no quarterback rating: This is cold, hard scouting. You can find rankings for all other positions on our B/R NFL 1000 main page. The B/R 1000 metric is based heavily on scouting each player and grading the key criteria for each position. The criteria are weighed according to importance for a possible best score of 100. Potential is not taken into consideration, nor are career accomplishments. Cornerbacks have many responsibilities—and those vary depending on the individual scheme. With that in mind, we graded them on run defense (10 points), coverage (75) and tackling (10), plus five points for their value as a starter or backup. In that category, we're looking at whether the player is a consistent starter, a spot starter, a top-level backup or simply a backup-only player. In the case of ties, our team asked, \"Which player would I rather have on my team?\" and set the rankings accordingly. Subjective? Yes. But ties are no fun. Each player was scouted by me and a team of experienced evaluators (Dan Bazal, Cian Fahey, Dan Hope, Marshal Miller, Justis Mosqueda) with these key criteria in mind. The following scouting reports and grades are the work of months of film study from our team. Players' heights, weights, seasons played and coverage stats from NFL.com unless otherwise noted. All other statistics from Pro Football Focus. Begin Slideshow » Coverage: 51/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 5/5 Greg Toler (6'0\", 190 lbs, 5 seasons) has big potential and has flashed top-tier talent at times, but he was far too inconsistent in 2014 as both a cover man and a tackler. On the ground, he saw 14 of his tackle attempts go for naught—a number that puts a huge damper on his run and tackle scores. In coverage, Toler played largely in man schemes while allowing nine touchdowns and letting 56 percent of attempts thrown his way go for a completion. Coverage: 53/75; Run Defense: 5/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 4/5 Coming off the best season of his career in 2013, Will Blackmon (6’0”, 204 lbs, 8 seasons) crashed back down to earth with a rough 2014 campaign. Working as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ slot cornerback for their first eight games, Blackmon was picked on in coverage and did not record a single pass deflection. After missing the second half of the season with a broken finger, Blackmon was released by the Jaguars this offseason. He was picked up by the Seattle Seahawks, where he is competing to be their slot cornerback, but the injury-prone 30-year-old is truly best suited for playing on special teams. Coverage: 56/75; Run Defense: 2/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 Melvin White (6’1”, 215 lbs, 2 seasons) began the 2014 season as a starter for the Carolina Panthers but lost playing time over the course of the year due to poor performance. A big but slow cornerback, White makes some plays on the ball with his length but does not play with enough physicality or fluidity to make up for his athletic shortcomings. He is inconsistent both in coverage and as a tackler and does not make the impact a cornerback of his size should in run defense. Coverage: 52/75; Run Defense: 6/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 At one point, Robert McClain (5’9”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) looked set to be one of the better slot cornerbacks in the NFL. However, his performances since that point have dropped off significantly. McClain struggles with his footwork, something that is a major issue for cornerbacks who play inside, and he can’t make up for that with length or ball skills. While he is a good run defender in terms of reacting to plays and aggressively forcing his way to ball-carriers, he must become a better tackler to truly show value there. Coverage: 55/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 5/10; Starter: 3/5 Chris Owens (5’9”, 180 lbs, 6 seasons) is one of many players across the NFL who is immediately thought of as a good slot cornerback simply because of his size. It’s true that Owens had proved to be adequate in the past, but his skill set doesn’t allow him to handle the two-way game that comes with playing inside. Owens doesn’t have the foot speed or balance to consistently contain the faster inside receivers in the NFL, which showed during the 2014 season. Coverage: 57/75; Run Defense: 4/10; Tackling: 2/10; Starter: 3/5 While Cassius Vaughn (5’11”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) has good long speed, he is slow coming out of his stance and flipping his hips, which enables receivers to beat him off the line frequently. He does not play physically and is a poor tackler. After one unimpressive season with the Detroit Lions, Vaughn signed this offseason with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he will have to fight just to make the 53-man roster.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Brooklyn-based electronica duo Ratatat hasn’t put out an album in almost exactly five years, with their last release being 2010’s well-regarded LP4. Since then, members Evan Mast and Mike Stroud have contented themselves with the occasional live show or collaboration, along with an apparent scouring of thrift stores and music shops for the various instruments and equipment they employ to make their pleasantly instrumental beats. Now, they’ve put that hard work and eagle-eyed shopping on display, with the band giving fans a chance to stream its latest album, Magnifique, for free as part of NPR’s First Listen program. (It’ll presumably get pulled down when the album is released on July 17.) Listening to Magnifique, it’s definitely a Ratatat album: defined by string-driven synths, which periodically rise to baroque, epic peaks, before cycling back down to something a little more mellow. The band is pushing the album as being more intentional and guitar-based than previous efforts, especially in the fourth track, “Abrasive,” which layers as many as 30 guitars on top of each other to produce a pleasant wash of sound. (That last bit of information comes courtesy of the liner notes the band put together for the album over at Genius, which are definitely worth checking out for any Ratatat superfans in the audience.)

    "LabBody": "Brooklyn-based electronica duo Ratatat hasn’t put out an album in almost exactly five years, with their last release being 2010’s well-regarded LP4. Since then, members Evan Mast and Mike Stroud have contented themselves with the occasional live show or collaboration, along with an apparent scouring of thrift stores and music shops for the various instruments and equipment they employ to make their pleasantly instrumental beats. Now, they’ve put that hard work and eagle-eyed shopping on display, with the band giving fans a chance to stream its latest album, Magnifique, for free as part of NPR’s First Listen program. (It’ll presumably get pulled down when the album is released on July 17.) Listening to Magnifique, it’s definitely a Ratatat album: defined by string-driven synths, which periodically rise to baroque, epic peaks, before cycling back down to something a little more mellow. The band is pushing the album as being more intentional and guitar-based than previous efforts, especially in the fourth track, “Abrasive,” which layers as many as 30 guitars on top of each other to produce a pleasant wash of sound. (That last bit of information comes courtesy of the liner notes the band put together for the album over at Genius, which are definitely worth checking out for any Ratatat superfans in the audience.)

According to congressional testimony given by General Joseph Dunford earlier this week, Russia is the biggest threat to the United States as President Vladimer Putin continues aggression not only in his region, but by reaching out to the enemies of the United States. \"Russia presents the biggest threat to our national security,\" Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"In Russia we have a nuclear power. We have one that not only has the capability to violate the sovereignty of our allies and to do things that are inconsistent with our national interests but they're in the process of doing so. If you want to talk about a nation that could pose an existential threat to the United States I have to point to Russia.\" Throughout the course of nuclear negotiations (which are ongoing after multiple deadlines were missed) between the U.S. and Iran, Russia has openly cozied up to the terrorist regime. Earlier this year, Putin put 40,000 on alert for military exercises and he's also been reaching out to the Chinese, who just hacked extremely sensitive information belonging to more than 20 million Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. will cut an additional 40,000 Army troops by 2017.",

    "DiffbotBody": "news Dearborn, Michigan has been completely taken over by Muslims, and now the police there are being forced to submit to Shariah law in a despicable way. It all started when a woman named Malak Kazan filed a lawsuit against the Dearborn Police Department after she was forced to remove her hijab for booking when she was arrested. The case was eventually settled out of court, but it inspired the police department to make some dangerous changes to their procedures. According to Conservative Tribune, the new policy will allow women to keep their hijabs on during booking, despite the fact that they could be hiding illegal weapons or materials underneath it. The policy will also ensure that a female officer, dispatcher, or employee will perform pat downs on Muslim women, instead of male officers. “I think this is the best policy that any local municipality or law enforcement agency can have for their inmates and Muslim women,” said Amir Makled, one of Kazan’s attorneys. “This will be used as the base line for all local enforcement agencies to set a policy and mirror what we have here.” Yes, you read that right: Kazan’s attorneys intend to fight for this to became a NATIONWIDE policy. This policy would open the door for criminals of both genders to hide all sorts of illegal materials under a hijab or a burqa. Women are not asked to take off their hijabs during booking to demean them: they are asked to do it for public safety. Policies like this represent the beginning of a potential Muslim takeover in the U.S. This has already happened in Europe, and we can NOT let that happen here! What do you think about this?

    "DiffbotBody": "Swearing off marriage forever, helping her gay friends find dates on Grindr, and being totally obsessed with Drake—these are not the things one expects to hear from a 77-year-old, but romance novelist Jackie Collins isn’t most septuagenarians. In a bizarre and delightful interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she gushes over hip-hop music and the TV show Empire and bashes the kind of rampant ageism actors including Maggie Gyllenhaal have recently railed against. “Women over 35 now are playing grandmothers. That’s what it’s down to. It’s absolutely crazy,” Collins told the magazine. “And then, 50-year-old actresses are all going and getting their faces done and [it] doesn’t look good,” she said. Collins built her career writing about the lives of women in Hollywood. Her most popular novel, 1983’s Hollywood Wives, sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and inspired the massively successful Aaron Spelling miniseries of the same name, which put ambitious but deeply complicated female screenwriters, actors, and agents at its center. Hollywood Wives showcased a series of powerful, decidedly non-matriarchal roles for women over the age of 35: Angie Dickinson, then 54, played one of the most influential agents in the industry; Stefanie Powers, 43 at the time, portrayed a deeply driven screenwriter; and Suzanne Somers and Candice Bergen, both 39 then, played bona-fide movie stars and celebrity sex symbols. So, Why Should You Care? That range of ages for leading female characters is almost unheard of in television and movies today. According to a San Diego State University analysis of TV series airing on broadcast networks, cable, and Netflix in 2013, just 15 percent of female characters were in their 40s, compared with 22 percent of male characters. The disparity is even greater in movies, which featured nearly twice as many male characters in their 40s as female characters in the same age range in 2014, according to a separate study by the same researchers. Collins’ writing has dramatized the seedy underbelly of Hollywood, but it has also smashed gender barriers in the literary world, in which books by male authors are more frequently published and more often reviewed than those by women. In between promoting her 32nd book, The Santangelos, the ninth in a series started in 1981, Collins is living a fiercely fabulous lifestyle modeled after the jet-setting bachelors she saw in Playboy as a kid in the 1940s and ’50s. A British-born high school dropout, Collins is one of the world’s best-selling authors, but she didn’t become one by chance. “I’m grateful every day for what I have, yeah, but I worked hard to get it,” she told the Reporter. Her refusal to shrug off her career as a fluke is significant in an industry in which women are often taught to deflect their success. In a recent episode of the Longform podcast, Wild author Cheryl Strayed emphasized the importance of women owning up to their work: “There’s a long history, of women especially, saying, ‘Well, I just got lucky.’ I didn’t just get lucky. I worked my f---ing ass off.” Collins surely would say the same—and she’s proudly reaping the benefits.",

(Charles Krupa | The Associated Press) Foxborough, Mass. — Clint Dempsey scored in the 47th minute to give the United States a 1-0 victory over Haiti in the CONCACAF Gold Cup on Friday night. Brad Guzan made a pair of point-blank saves in the second half for the Americans. The defending champions improved to 2-0 in the opening round and clinched the group title. They will play in the quarterfinals at Baltimore on July 18. Gyasi Zardes entered as a substitute for Jozy Altidore at the start of the second half, and the move immediately paid off. Greg Garza played the ball forward to Zardes, and Zardes cut a pass back to Dempsey, who scored with a right-footed shot from about 12 yards. Dempsey has scored in the last four games he's played for the U.S. national team, one shy of the record Altidore set two years ago. Dempsey's 44 international goals are 13 shy of Landon Donovan's American record. The Americans have won six in a row, are 30-1-2 in Gold Cup group play and have reached the knockout stage of all 13 Gold Cup tournaments. They have one game remaining in the group stage, against Panama on Monday in Kansas City, Kansas. Haiti, which is 0-1-1, will play Honduras on Monday, with the loser finishing last in the group. The U.S. nearly went ahead in the 34th minute, when Aron Johannsson beat goalkeeper Johny Placide. Johannsson was ruled offside, but replays showed he was onside when Altidore passed the ball to him. U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann switched the formation from 4-4-2 to 4-3-1-2 and changed seven starters, including his entire defensive line. Brad Evans was at right back, with Tim Ream and Omar Gonzalez the central defenders and Garza at left back. Mix Diskerud was in midfield and twice committed fouls that gave Haiti free kicks just outside the penalty area.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Fans of the late Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera wait to attend the memorial service at the Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City on December 19, 2012 in California. The service, billed by the Rivera family as a 'Celestial Graduation,'' was broadcast live and watched by her many fans off a big screen at a Universal CityWalk plaza. REDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images A couple of months ago, Don Pedro Rivera revealed that things seemed a little odd with Jenni Rivera days before her death during an interview with AztecaUS. He also told the network that the Rivera family was planning on reopening the case to investigate seven different institutions that were believed to be linked to “La Diva de la Banda’s” death. The DEA recently conducted an investigation on Christian Eduardo Esquino Núñez, owner of the plane in which Jenni was travelling on the day of her death, after finding a 1999 report that connected Esquino to drug trafficking. During this investigation, they came across with “Jennifer,” who is currently in the witness protection program, and has revealed details about the relationship between Jenni Rivera and Drug Lord Edgar Valdez Villareal “La Barbie.” According to “Jennifer,” the Banda singer was one of “La Barbie’s” favorite shows and he would hire her to sing at his house parties. The witness mentioned that during one of these events, Jenni and Valdez Villareal had an argument that caused Rivera to leave the party, but not without threatening the host on her way out. This is not the first time that Jenni’s death has been associated with drug dealers. Rumors started sparking up right after her death, when sources reported that other singers were receiving threats before performing at the Arena Monterrey in Nuevo León, México. Allegedly, Rivera received 3 warnings on the day of her concert in Monterrey, one before she arrived to the city, a second one hours before she went on stage, and a third one while the show was happening. Other performers have been victims of these threats, including Juan Gabriel, who opted to cancel his performances at the venue. Sources following the investigation have reported that the person responsible of this has been identified as “La Barbie’s” right hand. His name not yet been revealed, but the investigation continues as the Rivera family continues to focus on proving that “La Diva de la Banda’s” death might not have been an accident after all.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Mark Stehle Twelve cellblocks come together in a central vestibule where a skylight two stories above provides sunlight. Nestled just above the visitor's entrance to Philadelphia's House of Correction hangs a small wooden sign, painted blue, with \"Welcome\" written on the front, right next to the image of a grinning snowman. \"You'll see how hot it is when we get inside,\" one of the jail's corrections officers says as he ushers me through the lobby — full of whirling fans — and into Warden William Lawton's office for a quick chat. Lawton, a large man, is seated at the end of a long conference table, hunched over some paperwork. To his right, a large flat-screen television hangs from the wall, dormant, right next to a floor-to-ceiling tapestry of the late comedian Bernie Mac, who is shooting a thumbs-up right back at Lawton. This room, at least, has air conditioning. \"My grandson calls this the 'transformer jail!'\" Lawton says. \"He says, 'You're always transforming things to make them work.'\" Lawton, who has worked within the Philadelphia Prison System for 37 years, has been the House of Correction's warden for the last three. \"We've converted space for classrooms, for medical facilities, all of which were not parts of the correctional mindset 200 years ago.\" He tells me he's tired of repairing cracks in the ceiling, tired of sealing leaky pipes, tired of working in a jail built in 1874, then rebuilt using the same bricks in 1927. \"Our keys don't have an automated locking system,\" he says. He mimes unlocking a cell door, twisting one of his hands at the wrist. \"They're made out of brass. We have to special-order parts for them.\" And, on a steamy almost-summer day like today, he's tired of the weather: The jail, built along the same floor plan as the fortress called Eastern State Penitentiary, has no central cooling system. \"Today, it's hot, but unfortunately I can't take my population out to the mall,\" he says, chuckling. \"And the heating system is quite old, but unfortunately, winter still visits us all.\" He swings his hand out and points to a spot on the wall, just behind Bernie Mac. \"This wall is 8 inches thick! It's a real wall,\" he says, implying that it'd be nearly impossible to install new vents or pipes. \"There's no fire-suppression system here. If the place were to catch fire, we'd need to unlock each cell, one by one. It's hard just to provide the humane to people. \"There have been plans to replace this place for 15 years,\" he continues. \"But it just hasn't worked out.\" **** Lawton's concerns echo, almost word-for-word, those of City Councilman Bobby Henon, who has been trying — at Mayor Michael Nutter's request — to replace the House of Correction with a brand-new jail. Henon, a sturdy man with a thick helmet of iron-gray hair, was the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union's political director before winning a seat on Council in 2011. Henon's 6th Council District includes the neighborhoods of Mayfair, Frankford and Holmesburg, home of the House of Correction. In February, Nutter's office released its annual six-year capital program plan, which conspicuously included $4.9 million to purchase land for \"prison expansion potential.\" On April 30 Henon introduced Bill 150406 — which would let the city spend up to $7.2 million to buy a parcel of land at 7777 State Road, adjacent to the House of Correction. He chose, however, to hold the bill after the City Planning Commission voted 5-0 against the plan. (A number of Holmesburg residents also spoke out against the idea.) Both Henon's and Nutter's camps claim now is the right time to get started, mostly because there's land available: The House of Correction, which housed 1,492 lower-security prisoners as of Sunday, is a crumbling, perennial money-suck, Henon argues. Rather than spend millions to renovate it, building a new facility on the State Road property (which, interestingly, is owned by a limited-liability company called 7777 Philadelphia Pa Loan Associates, though Henon says the company is owned by BNP Paribas bank) makes far more sense to Henon, both monetarily and from a human-rights standpoint. The House is falling apart and should not be used to hold prisoners, Henon says. (Nutter also asked for $5 million this year to repair the jail's roof.) Critics have launched a full-scale attack on the plan, contending that building a new jail would likely cost the city between $300 million and $500 million, money City Council can never seem to find when it comes to funding Philly's impoverished School District. Henon has countered that money for a new jail would come from the city's capital budget, which comes from funds borrowed against municipal bonds, rather than its operating budget, where money for the schools is allocated. Though Henon argues that the capital budget is not funded directly by taxpayers, most of his opponents haven't bought his logic. Fellow Councilman Curtis Jones Jr. has been, perhaps, Henon's most vocal opponent on Council: \"Yeah it's two different budgets, but it comes out of your same pocket,\" he told WURD 900 AM radio host Solomon Jones. The city's General Obligation bonds, which would fund a portion of the land purchase, are repaid from the city's general tax revenues. Likewise, a number of prison-reform advocates believe the city should instead streamline its Department of Pretrial Services. There are currently 8,113 inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System's six facilities: Besides the 1,500 at the House of Correction (which theoretically is supposed to hold 1,250), about 2,700 men sit inside the city's largest jail, the Curran-Fromhold Correction Facility, which opened in 1995. Likewise, the 50-year-old Detention Center holds around 1,200; the Philadelphia Industrial Correction Center, opened in 1986, holds roughly 1,000; and the Riverside Correctional Facility, the city's sole female-only jail, holds 750 women. However, around 6,000 of the 8,000 people sitting in the Philadelphia Prison System are currently being held pretrial, many of them because they are unable to post bail. \"Our position on it is that the House of Correction should be closed,\" said civil rights lawyer David Rudovsky, when asked about what ought to happen to the jail. He insisted, however, that a new one should not be built. \"If you build it, you're gonna fill it. That's how prisons work.\" \"The jail population can be safely lowered to a point that new beds would not be needed,\" he added in an e-mail. Henon could have brought the land purchase to a vote during Council's final four legislative sessions in May and June but he held on to the bill after protesters, many of them members of the prison-reform advocacy group Decarcerate PA, flooded some of the meetings. On June 17, he sent it back to the Public Property Committee, saying he'd use the Council recess to speak to more constituents before bringing the bill to vote again in the fall. I sat down with Henon in his office on City Hall's fourth floor on June 29 to parse out what his plans were going forward. \"I agree that we need to cut down on the pretrial process, and the incarceration rates,\" he said. \"Decreasing the population should be addressed. But if you decrease the population from its current number to 6,000, there still will be a need for a House of Correction.\" He went on, stressing, as he has on numerous occasions, that his plan does not \"add\" a prison to the system: \"Once the new one is built, the old one will be shut down.\" He mentioned to me, however, that the proposed new jail would have 2,500 beds, a 1,000-bed increase over the existing House of Correction. Henon says the bed increase won't lead to a population increase. He says the new beds should just allow men throughout the system who are being held in triple cells to move to two-man cells in the new facility. But an increase in beds does not necessarily lead to a decrease in overcrowding. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons increased overall capacity of federal prisons in this country by 8,300 beds from 2006 to 2011, only to see its levels of crowding increase as well, due to an increase in arrests, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. According to a Pew Charitable Trusts report, Philly's jail population peaked at 9,787 inmates in 2009, before falling to around 7,700 in 2011. The population is now about 400 larger, mainly for two reasons. Mayor Nutter in 2012 asked the city to begin issuing higher bails to those accused of gun crimes, effectively punishing inmates before they've been convicted. The second reason has to do with a 2009 Inquirer series about men and women skipping bail in Philadelphia: In response, the city created a Bench Warrant Court in 2012 to crack down on bail fugitives. Earlier this year, the city received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation to look into ways to decrease its jail population. Through everything, one point remains undeniable: Absolutely no one should be sitting inside the House of Correction. **** Back out in the main lobby, visitors enter and exit, and guards shout to be heard over the sound of the fans. The air is thick, soupy and stale-smelling. Capt. Joe Browne, one of the jail's chief corrections officers — tall, with gray hair, a long face and the wide stance of a man prepared to break up a brawl — leads us out of the lobby. We go through a small courtyard wrapped in barbed wire, through a metal detector and come up to a thick metal gate. On the other side is a hallway with doors to the jail's schoolhouse, medical center and visitation room. Inmates, clad in blue, line up along the right side of the central hallway as they wait to enter the visitation room. Most stare at the ground. A guard jams a thick, brass key into the door and swings it open with two hands. The visitation room seems standard, if a bit low-budget: Prisoners sit in plastic chairs, arranged in rows and their visitors sit facing them, about 2 feet away, just far enough to make it difficult to touch. \"They're allowed to hug and kiss each other good-bye,\" Shawn Hawes, a prison spokesperson, tells me. An air-conditioning unit the size of a vending machine drones on, drowning out what is being said. **** The original House of Correction was built — ironic as this may now sound — to alleviate overcrowding. In response to a prison system absolutely swamped with inmates, the city in 1861 convened a Joint Committee on the Erection of a House of Corrections, which issued a report that is still available at the Philadelphia Free Library's Central Branch. James J. Barclay, then the president of the city's Board of Managers, wrote that in 1859, the city's prisons were so overstuffed with victims of \"intemperance\" that more than 7,000 people were discharged for \"want of room\" in that year alone. Sadder still, the system was, even in the 19th century, clogged with inmates being held pretrial: At Moyamensing Prison, which stood at 1400 S. 10th St. from 1835 to 1963, men slept three to five to a cell, and there were \"hardly 50 cells to spare for the number of untried criminals alone.\" So, to hopefully relieve some of the system's congestion, the city got to work on the original House of Correction, which opened in 1874. \"All through the 19th century, there was this really strong belief that isolation was good,\" says Sean Kelley, a prison historian and director of interpretation and public programming at Eastern State Penitentiary. \"The model for the original House of Correction would have undoubtedly been solitary confinement.\" The House's board of directors kept detailed records through the jail's first few years of operation, noting that the facility became overcrowded almost immediately. A year after opening, there were more than 1,500 inmates inside, and board members had already begun petitioning the city to buy more land. \"I cannot too strongly recommend the purchase of additional property,\" one remarked, after noting that there was not enough farmland surrounding the prison to properly feed the inmates. By 1876, the overcrowding had become worrisome: The facility processed 8,074 inmates, and, at any point in the year, typically held more than 2,000. The building was knocked down in 1925 and rebuilt, opening again two years later. \"It's hard to emphasize enough how much it looks like Eastern State,\" Kelley says. \"It looks shockingly similar. It's medieval.\" He says, however, that 100-year-old prisons are common across the country. \"Nineteen twenty-six is, sad to say, not that old of a prison in the scheme of things.\" Kelley adds, \"These things are really built to take abuse. They're built to withstand people who want to intentionally harm them. What they build might be around for the next hundred years.\" **** With the door closed, the prison Learning Lab feels like an elementary school classroom. There's a large teacher's desk in the center of the room, and the walls, painted a light blue, are covered in bright-colored posters espousing the joys of English and arithmetic. Mid-2000s-era PCs line the back wall. These, I'm told, are used to administer G.E.D. training. \"Most of our inmates are testing around the fifth-grade reading level,\" says Hawes, the prison spokesperson. Wayne Jacobs, a former inmate who now heads X-Offenders for Community Empowerment, a group that helps parolees find employment after leaving prison, told me he believes the city ought to be relying more on G.E.D. training programs to keep those awaiting trial out of the permanent prison population. \"The city should begin to look at those 1,500 prisoners to see how many are willing to go to drug treatment, mental-health treatment, G.E.D. job readiness while they're waiting to go to court,\" Jacobs says. \"They can easily send those folks to those particular programs. They should increase their pretrial-services budget, so they can be able to place people on house arrest in those programs. This way, we will be able to empty out the House of Correction.\" Angus Love, executive director of the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, which provides legal services to those in prisons, jails and state hospitals, agrees. He believes the city can reduce its population to far fewer than the 6,000 Henon talked about. \"New York City reduced its population,\" Love says. That city's prison population dropped from 22,000 in 1991 to 13,200 in 2009, largely because the city reduced the number of people it arrested on drug charges, according to a report compiled by the Vera Insitute of Justice, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the nonprofit JFA Institute. By city population alone, Philadelphia ought to have a quarter of New York's jail population, Love said, \"but we over-incarcerate. If we invest in alternatives to incarceration, like mental-health treatment, we can bring the population down to three to four thousand, and they could fit inside Curran-Fromhold.\" A few feet down the hall, through an open door, sits the jail's mental-health screening ward. It is, simply put, a paltry excuse for an intake center. There are three small desks for the social workers that assess prisoners, and only one desk sits behind a small door that can be shut to preserve privacy. Today, because the door is open, I peer in and an inmate waves at me and shouts, \"Hello!\" as if we're neighbors running into one another at the bank. A social worker, who asked not to be named, points to a chair next to her desk. \"If I'm talking with a patient, he sits right here, and everyone can hear him,\" she says. I ask if she'd prefer to work in a new facility. \"Ooh,\" she says, pausing for a moment. \"Actually, no. I believe we need to invest more in schools than in a jail. But I think if we focused more on childhood intervention, we'd keep a lot of people out of this system.\" **** The jail's central vestibule sits at the end of the hallway. Standing inside, one gets the sensation of being down in a large pit; the room is semicircular, the bricks are the color of dirt and gray sunlight streams through a skylight vaulted two stories above the ground. Here, 12 hallways arranged like spokes on a wheel meet, each blocked off with an iron gate. We enter one hallway with cells holding 164 prisoners. There's a ruddy shower room at the beginning of the hall, across from a pay-phone bank that appears to have been cleaned even less often than the showers. Exposed copper pipes snake up and around the walls. As we walk, one of the pipes emits a hiss, and water drips down and collects in a puddle on the floor. The entire floor, for that matter, has a film to it. We pass cell after cell. The doors are neither the sliding-style seen in cartoons, nor the thick, gray kind used in most maximum-security prisons. They are, instead, short, hobbit-hole-looking wire grates that may very well have been hand-assembled. There's a tiny porthole in each. Some men stick their faces through them to stare at us, while others lay on their bunks, some shirtless to combat the heat, some with towels over their faces. Browne opens a cell and orders two men out so we can enter. \"Relax, they're not here to search your stuff,\" he tells them. About the size of a college-dorm room, the space houses three men. The walls are stark white, and a copy of the Daily News sits on the bed to the left. To the right, there are two bunk beds, each no bigger than the average human body. Wawa milk cartons sit on the windowsill. Above the sink, in one of the corners, the ceiling has cracked and is beginning to cave in. Wire mesh covers the window, and it's impossible to see anything outside, only whether it's day or night. The air feels heavy and damp, and it's difficult to breathe. On the way out, Browne stops to chat with a group of inmates waiting to head to visitation. Most keep their eyes fixed on the ground. \"Do you guys have any opinions about the House of Correction?\" he asks them. No answer. \"C'mon, guys! I'm serious.\" \"It sucks,\" one inmate says. \"How's the food?\" Browne asks. \"Shitty,\" an older inmate leaning against a gate says, without looking up. \"See?\" Browne asks, turning to me. \"No coercion at all.\"",

Do you have some specific examples? Also, you might be interested in what our Founding Fathers had to say about separation of Church and State: “If I could conceive that the general government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.” - George Washing...See More Richard Boyle · San Francisco, California Nelda White White: Those rights are \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They are enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, not our Constitution. The Declaration of Independece does not have the force of law. The Constitution is the law of the land. Article 1 of the Constitution has this to say: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Upon this is based our concept of the separation of church and state. Thomas Jefferson also noted: “Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry.” - Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom (1779)",

    "DiffbotBody": "Pope Francis greets the crowd of faithful from a popemobile in Quito, Ecuador, July 5, 2015. Francis landed in Ecuador's capital Quito on Sunday to begin an eight-day tour of South America that will also include visits to Bolivia and Paraguay. On his first visit as pontiff to Spanish-speaking Latin America, the Argentina-born pope is scheduled to conduct masses in both Quito and the coastal city of Guayaquil before flying to Bolivia on Wednesday. Pope Francis started his nine-day tour of Latin America, his first as pontiff, on Sunday, arriving in Quito, Ecuador, where he said, \"No one, save Jesus Christ, possesses his or her own light.\" During his trip, Francis is likely to focus on poverty and inequality as well as reiterate his concern for the environment. \"I have come as a witness of God's mercy and of faith in Jesus Christ,\" Francis said in his prepared remarks at the welcome ceremony Sunday in Quito. Children in traditional dress greeted the pope at the Mariscal Sucre airport, and shook hands with many of them. \"In Ecuador is the point closest to outer space: it is the peak of Chimborazo, which for that reason is called the place 'closest to the sun,' the moon and the stars,\" the 78-year-old pope said, according to Vatican Radio. \"We Christians identify Christ with the sun, and the moon with the Church, the community of the faithful. No one, save Jesus Christ, possesses his or her own light.\" The pope added: \"May you never lose the ability to protect what is small and simple, to care for your children and your elderly, to have confidence in the young, and to be constantly struck by the nobility of your people and the singular beauty of your country.\" Departing from his prepared remarks, South America's first pope told the crowd that concern for the most vulnerable \"is a debt that all of Latin America has.\" Francis has said he wants a \"Poor Church for the Poor.\" And this is reflected also in his choice of countries he has visited. For example, he visited Albania and Bosnia in Europe before going to wealthier countries in the region. \"The point he wants to make ... is his conviction that often those on the margins are the most receptive to the church, and he wants to give voice to those on the margins,\" Austen Ivereigh, an expert on the church and author of a biography, The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope, told Los Angeles Times. In Ecuador, Francis has only one scheduled private meeting, on Monday, with a nearly 91-year-old priest, the Rev. Francisco Cortes, at the Colegio Javier seminary in Guayaquil. Affectionately known as Padre Paquito, Cortes walks slowly with a cane with a built-in flashlight and admits to a lifelong weakness for cigars, according to The Associated Press. \"I don't know why he set the meeting. We haven't even corresponded,\" The Associated Press quoted Cortes as saying. \"I'm really just a Mr. Nobody,\" During his 13-hour flight to Quito, the pope greeted each of the 75 journalists traveling with the papal entourage, talking to them, Vatican Radio reported. A Bolivian journalist gave him a batch of drawings from children of that country. \"I love children's drawings,\" Francis was quoted as saying. The pontiff will also travel to Bolivia and Paraguay over the next eight days.",

Green Valley Ranch Resort Don’t want to leave Henderson, but still want to catch some awesome fireworks? No problem! GVR lights the sky afire around 9 p.m. The \"We Love Locals Fireworks Blast\" lasts nine minutes and is simulcast on \"The Coyote\" KCYE 102.7 and \"The Star\" 107.9.

Station Casinos recommends viewing the show from the resort's south parking lot off of Summerlin Centre Drive.

Directed by Maya Forbes. Rated R. Opens Friday. Around the time that his buddy and frequent collaborator Adam Sandler signed a multi-film, multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix, David Spade announced that he’d be making a sequel to his 2001 comedy Joe Dirt as an original movie for the free VOD service Crackle, and Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser plays like an even cheaper, lazier version of a typical Sandler movie. The slapdash plot finds mulleted redneck Joe Dirt (Spade) traveling back in time via a Wizard of Oz-style tornado, although the production is so barebones that its past looks suspiciously like the present. Most of the original supporting cast returns, but they all seem vaguely confused as to what they’re doing there. Spade and co-writer/director Fred Wolf beat every feeble joke into the ground, and the plot drags on interminably only to end up in the exact same place it started. You’d think that after 14 years, they’d have more than stale fart jokes and weak callbacks to bits that weren’t funny in the first place.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Tropical Diseases add your opinion email MNT featured A new study has shed further light on how malaria parasites survive in the bloodstream by identifying a key protein, called a protein kinase, that if targeted, can stop the disease. Researchers identified a particular protein kinase as an essential pathway for the parasite's survival within the bloodstream. Although can be treated if diagnosed early on, the life-threatening disease still currently infects more than 200 million people worldwide and accounts for more than 500,000 deaths per year according to the World Health Organization. The disease is traditionally transferred by parasites that live within infected mosquitoes, which are transmitted to humans by mosquito bites. The study, published in Nature Communications, and funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome Trust, utilized state of the art methods to examine the complex biochemical pathways parasites used to enter red blood cells and survive within them. One such method explored was chemical genetics, in which synthetic chemicals are used in combination with introducing changes to the DNA of the parasite. Researchers identified a particular protein kinase, called PfPKG, as an essential pathway for the parasite's survival within the bloodstream. By understanding which protein is required for the parasite to infect and survive, the scientists were able to prevent the protein from working, killing the parasite and stopping the disease from developing. 'A real breakthrough' The study was co-authored by Prof. David Baker from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Prof. Andrew Tobin from the MRC Toxicology Unit. The latter described the result as a real breakthrough in the fight against malaria. He said: \"This is a real breakthrough in our understanding of how malaria survives in they bloodstream and invades red blood cells. We've revealed a process that allows this to happen and if it can be targeted by drugs we could something that stops malaria in its tracks without causing toxic side effects.\" The research follows a 2012 study conducted by Rob Dzikowoski and colleagues from the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, where they were first able to identify the genetic mechanism that parasites used to selectively express one protein while hiding from others. The treatment for malaria has improved rapidly within the last decade. Since 2000, malaria mortality rates have fallen by over 25%, however, a January 2015 report published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases found that the rise of Ebola, may have led to 74,000 untreated cases of malaria. The study, conducted in Guinea, was the first systematic analysis of outpatient health following the Ebola epidemic. Prof. Patrick Maxwell, chair of the MRC's Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board, admitted malaria still poses a \"global challenge.\" He said: \"Tackling malaria is a global challenge, with the parasite continually working to find ways to survive our drug treatments. By combining a number of techniques to piece together how the malaria parasite survives, this study opens the door on potential new treatments that could find and exploit the disease's weak spots but with limited side effects for patients.\" Written by Peter Lam Copyright: Medical News Today",

    "DiffbotBody": "Uber and Lyft have taken to prices slashes in Manhattan as they continue to fight. The battleground of the ride-hailing war has now moved from San Francisco to Manhattan. On Friday, bitter rivals Uber and Lyft, both of which offer on-demand rides with the tap of a mobile app, announced price slashes to their carpooling services in Manhattan. So, if you’re looking for a ride and don’t want to grab a taxi, here are your options: UberPool: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan, as long as it starts and ends south of 96th Street, and it will cost $10 at most (or less if the distance doesn’t reach $10 per Uber’s fare math), and regardless of whether you get matched to carpool with another rider. Uber says this is for a limited time, so keep an eye out for announcements in case it changes. Lyft Line: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan as long as it starts and ends south of 97th Street (note the extra block), and it will cost only $5 even if you’re not matched with another carpooler. The catch is that this only works for one rider. If you are with a friend, you will be charged $1 dollar for both of you to get into the car. Gett: This Israeli car service contender has been quieter than Uber and Lyft, but it’s been offering $10 rides anywhere in Manhattan south of 110th Street since last September. Oh, and you don’t have to carpool and you get to ride in a fancy black car. Uber and Lyft have been running this playbook in San Francisco for several months now, and prices have fluctuated. Manhattanites should expect these deals to be temporary. New York’s city council is also expected to consider a proposal that would halt these services’ expansion by capping the number of cars they can add every year, so any of the above could be affected. Lyft recently agreed to pay $300,000 to settle a city complaint. At least New York still has a pretty good subway system…",

The liberal media quickly jumped on the story, making it go viral in an attempt to slander the name of Selleck due to his conservative views. Unfortunately for these liberal haters, however, this story is about to come to an end. According to Daily Mail, Selleck has reached a tentative agreement with the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County, located just north of Los Angeles. The agreement will now go to the agency’s board for approval, and they will be meeting to decide on that next Wednesday. “We’re happy about it,” commented Eric Bergh, the district’s resources manager. “It’s good news.” He added that details of the agreement are confidential. Selleck and his wife of nearly 30 years Jillie Mack were accused of dispatching a white truck to retrieve gallons of water from a valley close to their ranch on 12 occasions in 2013. The water district spent $22,000 on a private investigator to catch the Hollywood couple. This agreement, however, means that this story is now coming to a close, so it’s time for the liberal media to back off and leave the Sellecks alone!",

As the days pass since the release of the scandalous pictures celebrities have been responding to the scandal with humor and in some cases a sense of disgust. Kaley Cuoco, star of the Big Bang Theory posted a funny answer to the hacking of her own iCloud account with a censored photo of herself and husband Ryan Sweeting taken on a beach in Mexico.

Despite being hacked herself, Cuoco took a humorous take on the scandal that was not followed by Oscar winner Kirsten Dunst who posted the image of a slice of pizza and a pile of excrement as a thank you to Apple and their iCloud to her Twitter account. Dunst was just one of a group of celebrities to be hacked in August, the group also includes fellow Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, former Disney star Selena Gomez and model Kate Upton. British comedian and the creator of The Office, Ricky Gervais added his own voice to the scandal by telling celebrities not to take naked pictures of themselves and save them to their computers. Gervais later backtracked and stated his comments were meant as a joke and had been taken in the wrong context, before posting the blame for the scandal lies solely at the door of the hackers. Girls star Lena Dunham refused to blame the celebrities and backed her fellow Hollywood stars in their right to take naked photos of themselves if they wish to do so.

    "LabBody": "Kaley Cuoco leads Celebrity Response to Nude Photo Hacking Scandal. Hollywood has recently been rocked by the nude photo scandal that saw the iCloud accounts of some of the top names in showbiz hacked and naked photos of the stars released on the Internet. As the days pass since the release of the scandalous pictures celebrities have been responding to the scandal with humor and in some cases a sense of disgust. Kaley Cuoco, star of the Big Bang Theory posted a funny answer to the hacking of her own iCloud account with a censored photo of herself and husband Ryan Sweeting taken on a beach in Mexico. The photo is blurred over the chest of Cuoco and the groin of Sweeting with a caption stating the pair had apparently forgotten something on their trip to the beach. Despite being hacked herself, Cuoco took a humorous take on the scandal that was not followed by Oscar winner Kirsten Dunst who posted the image of a slice of pizza and a pile of excrement as a thank you to Apple and their iCloud to her Twitter account.

    "DiffbotBody": "Crowds generated from vacation Bible school likely deter crime, a parishioner says Tyler Burkholder, who works at Tidings of Peace Mennonite Church, looks over the 300 block of East Poplar Street in York with his wife, Sarah. The church runs a school of about 40 students from K-12. Tyler Burkholder, 21, said outreach programs commonly involve large groups of city kids. 'I have a heart for the kids,' he said. 'I made bad choices as a kid, and I'd like to see them do better than I did and better than some are doing now.' (Jason Plotkin — Daily Record/Sunday News) It is documented in the Bible that Christians congregated in cities, Tyler Burkholder said. A city full of Christians would be able to reach more people. Burkholder is a parishioner at Tidings of Peace Mennonite Church, an East Poplar Street fixture in York's Olde Towne East neighborhood for nearly 60 years. He works as a logistics coordinator for the church's school and helps run their outreach programs in York. Living and working in the city, about a block away from a June 2014 fatal shooting, helps Burkholder and his church reach city youth, he said. The school's enrollment is roughly 40 from K-12, but its vacation Bible school had 130 kids this past week, almost all from the city, Burkholder said. Tidings of Peace solicits neighbors to attend their services, but word-of-mouth brings a lot of attendants. Thursday nights throughout the year are like small-scale vacation Bible schools, said Sarah Burkholder, Tyler's wife. That ministry draws between 50 and 80 people. Sarah, 25, is from Lancaster. Tyler Burkholder, who is originally from Missouri, is 21. It is his goal in life to help kids learn important life lessons without experiencing gangs or violence. The couple feels safe in the city, living in an upstairs apartment at their 318 E. Poplar St. church. The block used to be worse, he said, but the church benefits from having some great neighbors, people who actually care. He thinks the Bible study crowds deter crime in the area. \"I have a heart for the kids,\" Tyler Burkholder said. \"I made bad choices as a kid, and I'd like to see them do better than I did and better than some are doing now.\" Contact Mark Walters at 717-771-2032.

    "DiffbotBody": "Another Discovery Channel 'Shark Week' strikes, experts say drama overblown A great white shark swims near Guadalupe Island off the coast of Mexico in this undated file publicity image provided by Discovery Channel. The cable channel's immensely popular 'Shark Week' series has been running since 1988. AP Photo/Discovery Channel Published: Tuesday, July 7, 2015 at 11:28 a.m. Last Modified: Tuesday, July 7, 2015 at 8:45 p.m. Facts Don't get bit Robert Hueter with the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota on how to avoid shark bites: 1. Don't swim after dusk, or early in the morning, because sharks' vision is more discriminating with light 2. Don't swim near fishermen 3. Don't wear flashy jewelry or items that can reflect sunlight 4. Don't wear bright bathing suits 5. Don't swim if you have open wounds It's the height of summer, 40 years since \"Jaws\" turned sharks into shallow-water Hollywood slashers, and Americans are tuning in once again to Discovery Channel's \"Shark Week.\" An immensely popular summer staple since 1988, cable television's longest-running thrill ride premieres again tonight at 8, and expectations are doubtlessly huge. Shark-cage daredevils, freakish wounds and dismemberments, spawning titles such as \"Ocean of Fear,\" \"Blood in the Water\" and \"Teeth of Death,\" disgorging a suspiciously realistic caper touting the return of the long-extinct 50-ton megalodon — \"Shark Week\" has set a high bar for drama. But in doing so, Discovery has provoked blowback from conservation groups, who charge its unremitting demonization of the ocean's top predator has resulted in needless fear and the gratuitous slaughter of sharks. And Discovery Channel's new president, Rich Ross, has said \"Shark Week 2015\" will not feature any new fake documentaries. In fact, wary ichthyologist Robert Hueter, senior scientist and director of shark research at Sarasota's Mote Marine Laboratory, agreed to work with Discovery during a February expedition to Cuba. kill this line for printThat groundbreaking initiative, in which American and Cuban scientists placed the first satellite transmitters on sharks in Cuban waters, airs at 10 p.m. Tuesday in an episode called \"Tiburones: The Sharks of Cuba.\" A student of sharks for more than 40 years, author of more than 150 related papers, Hueter addressed common misconceptions about sharks in an interview we'll call \"Five Things You Should Know About Sharks\": 1. Christmas tree lights are more dangerous. More people are electrocuted by Christmas tree lights each year than are killed in shark attacks. \"When you look at the numbers, sharks bite less than 100 people a year. Last year we had a total of 72 or 74 in the entire world and three were fatal. On the other side of the ledger, fishing activities around the world take about 100 million sharks every year. ... Approximately 1 million sharks are killed for every person that is bitten by a shark. ... A human life and a shark's life are not to be equated, but the real danger is to sharks more than it is to us.\" 2. Our planet needs sharks. Robust shark populations are vital to Earth's ecology. \"We're removing somewhere around 100 million sharks every year from the world's oceans. That's a huge amount and that's not sustainable. ... Sharks are what we call top predators in the ocean system. They sit on top of these food webs or food pyramids, and if we were to totally eliminate the sharks, it would cause ripple effects all the way down the food web and actually destroy certain ecosystems. ... For example, very good research that has been done in the Caribbean Sea or Pacific showed that when sharks are removed, the coral reef died.\" 3. There are no Freddy Kruegers in the shark realm. \"There are about 500 species of sharks in the world, and of those 500 species, about a dozen of them have been implicated in bites on people. What we call the 'Big Three' are the white shark, the tiger shark and the bull shark because these are animals that get to be fairly big bodied and they do go after larger prey. They'll go after other sharks. They'll go after marine mammals and big rays and so on. ... They're not looking for us. They're looking for a prey fish. ... Yes, we have white sharks out in the Gulf of Mexico and, yes, they can be relatively large, but they don't come in close to the beach at all. We've been tracking white sharks for the last few years that come into the Gulf. I think the closest they've come to this coastline is about 40 or 50 miles away. ... That's actually a very rare animal. Most sharks top out at about 6 feet long. Most of them are not interested in people. We're definitely not on their menu.\" 4. Call it a bite, not an attack. \"Most of the incidents of the unprovoked attacks — which I prefer to call bites — most of these are by smaller sharks like the blacktip shark, which is a more numerous animal. It's a fast swimmer. It's a fish eater. And this is the shark that is going through the surf and will sometimes make a mistake and grab someone's hand or foot or calf, let go, and that will be the end of that. ... We do get some shark incidents around the Fourth of July, and the reason is not because of the number of sharks, but because of the number of people in the water that weekend. Everybody goes to the beach. It's a hot time of year. Sharks are feeding. It's their time as well. When you get so many people in the water, sometimes paths cross and somebody gets bitten. ... A lot of people are in the water where sharks are feeding and the sharks sometimes see a surfer's foot or a swimmer's hand and come up and bite and go 'That's not right' and leave.\" 5. Where the sharks are. Some waters really do produce more shark bites than others. \"This is more of an issue on the east coast of Florida: Volusia County, around Daytona Beach, Brevard County, a place we call 'Shark Alley,' where we get as many as a couple of dozen bites on people a year. And the problem there is this heavy surf. ... As we go farther north and get into colder climates on the East Coast, the fauna begins to change. The shark species begin to change. You get species like the sandbar shark, which happens to migrate down here in the winter time. ... And then you get Mako sharks, blue sharks, and finally, again, the great white, which is really a cooler water animal that prefers to eat large prey when they get really big ... like seals that live in the northeast in places like Cape Cod. ... The more serious injuries are off California by white sharks. Hawaii sometimes has serious attacks by tiger sharks. Those are not more numerous than Florida, but they're typically more serious.\" Billy Cox and Jessica Floum write for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. All rights reserved.

    "DiffbotBody": "The recent flooding in Houston and other parts of Texas could haunt car buyers in the months ahead if you are not careful. Asia Prather has learned about flooded cars the hard way. She showed her flood damaged car: a Ford Focus that at first glance looked pristine. But when she opened the trunk, it was another story. \"You can see the rust and tell that the car had been under water,\" she said. Under the trunk liner was visible rust and mold. How Did She End up With a Flood Car? But she didn't know it until she brought the car in for service one day, and \"they looked under it and told me they could tell it was a flood vehicle,\" she said. Prather was stunned. She bought the car from a private seller a little over a year ago. The Carfax report was clean, showing no major accidents, no salvage title, and certainly no flood. But now the 2008 Ford has rusting metal even inside the doors. \"There's a rust stain, from water damage,\" she said, pointing to a series of rusted inside door bolts. Cars Dried Out Quickly After Flood The National Insurance Crime Bureau says many flood damaged cars are quickly dried out and resold before Carfax (or anyone else) finds out. Owners trade them in before rust or electrical problems start. Often the dealer doesn't even know, unless he looks under carpeting and inside doors. The group warns that thousands of flood damaged cars from Texas will be hitting the market soon, often thousands of miles away. Two years ago, mechanic JT Mason showed us a flood damaged PT Cruiser. The top looked new, but underneath, rust was everywhere, even on the floors, frame rails, and suspension parts. \"The suspension's not very good,\" he explained. \"The brake system is totally disabled in the rear.\" Attorney General offices across the country are now warning car buyers about the newest round of flood cars. They say to avoid one.... Start by getting the Carfax report Always buy from a reputable dealer, not a run down buy-here-pay-here lot, no matter how good the deal. Pay a mechanic $100 to inspect it. Be very careful of used cars that were registered in Texas, or older used cars from the New Jersey coast (Sandy), or New Orleans (Katrina). \"You see cars coming out of that area, and you know where that cars come from, I would be a little leery of it. And I would ask a few questions, if the car had a Texas registration in its past,\" said Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. Asia Prather says it's not right. \"If they had a mother, daughter, or relative....they wouldn't do that and they wouldn't want it done to them,\" she said. Beware As-Is Cars Unfortunately, because she purchased the car as-is from a private seller, more than a year ago, she has no recourse. As-is means you buy it \"as it is,\" with no warranty whatsoever, and you would have to sue the seller in court for any hope of reimbursement.

Additional modifications were still being discussed in weekly meetings last month. The 635,000-square-foot facility will have about 36,000 seats and total capacity of 40,000 people. The new stadium replaces the existing facility on the west side of the city and is expected to be completed in time for the 2017 football season.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single. Its ornate but in-the-pocket production is as silky and flawlessly orchestrated a track as Quik has made since the late '90s, and it boasted one of the best lead-off lines for a rap verse this year: \"Now what they want to go cancel Arsenio Hall for?/ Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for.\" Hall’s talk show rose to prominence in the early '90s, around the same time that Quik was finding commercial success, and he appeared on \"Arsenio\" a few times both to rap and DJ; last year—on a newly resurrected version of the show—the rapper announced the release of The Midnight Life. In a song that mostly celebrates living in the present—more focused on the narrative of maintaining than reclaiming glory—the nostalgic line feels poignant; like second-time-loser Arsenio, the perpetually \"most underrated\" Quik has been declared down for the count more than once, and may now be winding down himself. But as in the case of most of Quik’s work, the complaint is just a point in the rapper’s tangled constellation of talking points (mainly, taunts and come-ons to adversaries, fair-weather fans, and the female population of South Central at large), which are as full of ingenious contradictions as his beats. —Winston Cook-Wilson DJ Quik: \"Pet Sematary\" There was a time when the killing in a Lauryn Hill song was done softly and figuratively, through the power of music. That time was long ago. In the late 1990s, a false rumor about the singer/songwriter who would become perhaps rap's most gifted recluse supposedly saying she'd rather die than have white people buying her albums spread so widely there's a Snopes.com page dedicated to debunking it. Over the years since the former Fugees member's sole solo studio album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as she has drifted in and out of the public eye, her self-aggrandizing statements and unfortunate habit of showing up late for live shows have continued to divide, in ways that still say more about the culture than about her. When Hill went to prison to serve a three-month sentence for tax evasion in 2013, she opened herself to further miscomprehension by discussing her conviction in terms of slavery, colonialism, and institutionalized racism. It might not have played well in Peoria, but she was bringing up a legacy America has yet to escape, in ways that became tragically obvious this year. In the same pre-prison pronouncement, Hill said, \"You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\" In 2012, she had premiered a spoken-word piece titled \"Black Rage\", which turned the lyrical framework of Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein's \"My Favorite Things\" into a prolix litany of the crimes that one group of people have perpetrated against another, and a stinging endorsement of anger as an antidote to fear; in later live versions the interpolation became, like John Coltrane's classic cover, a musical one, as well. When the artist, now known professionally as Ms. Lauryn Hill, shared \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" in late August, with a call for peace in Missouri, the times had caught up with her song. She once told an interviewer, \"If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children,\" and this sketch, recorded in her living room, benefits by couching its broad social themes in family-like intimacy; her kids' voices can be heard behind her deepening, huskier roar, along with acoustic guitar and a murmuring rhythm. Some will share Hill's fury, some won't, but her unexpurgated message of focused resilience points toward part of what has been missing all along: A mutual understanding. To promote a new pay-for-view concert video, Hill recently shared a clip of herself performing the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" live in Brooklyn. In the song, as on the original, she raps, \"While you're imitating Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone.\" Simone, the subject of a controversial upcoming biopic, prefigured aspects of Hill's career trajectory in her own evolution toward racial confrontation. Simone reportedly warned Martin Luther King Jr., on meeting him, that she wasn't nonviolent. \"Not to worry, sister,\" King responded; she even later insisted upon being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" You'd never guess it by the ongoing rounds of backlash against Hill, which prompted Talib Kweli to write an essay defending her this year, but this mere Ms. has yet to go as far in her radicalism as the late legend, who, singing the then-new \"Mississippi Goddam\" at Carnegie Hall in 1964, blithely informed a mostly white audience, \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies/ You're all gonna die and die like flies.\" But \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" belongs to that tradition, one of righteous indignation in the face of injustice, speaking to the persecuted wherever they may be, whatever they might look like. And it shows that, for all the actual death and cruelty in the headlines, the sound of music can still be quietly devastating. —Marc Hogan The other side of \"Chorus\", a 12'' single issued at the start of the year by the globally minded electronic producer Holly Herndon, sounds like an audition tape for the relatively esoteric sound-art label Editions Mego. During \"Solo Voice\", slivers and snapshots of her voice twist into pointillist spires—chirpy and more musical than the most recent experiments of clear inspiration Florian Hecker, but only by degrees. Even Herndon’s most kinetic work has always seemed as driven by ideas as approachability, and \"Solo Voice\" is an unabashed expression of the former. Could a disembodied and dissected human voice be built into something new with computers? \"Chorus\" explores a similar line of inquiry. Herndon splits her simple, fetching melody into bits, so that her words seem sung by a cyborg programmed with a speech impediment. Syllables end abruptly, stand alone, and stretch over open space. But Herndon twists those samples of herself around beats that sometimes boom and burst like dubstep and sometimes stutter and sprint like IDM. In the space between the two, Herndon laces a panoply of fragments gathered piecemeal as she browsed online. The result, vividly illustrated in a subsequent video collaboration with Japanese artist Akihiko Taniguchi, blurs the relationship between web and browser, machine and user, data and devourer. Herndon becomes the principal input in a system bigger than herself, and she tries to be altered without being absorbed. It’s a canny reflection on our digital lives, rendered with a physicality that pulls it back into our own mainframe. —Grayson Haver Currin \"I Am Not Afraid\", the track that kicks off the gorgeous In Conflict, is as much a riddle as it is a song. Those who may have arrived at Owen Pallett’s music by way of his theoretical explications of pop tracks wouldn’t have been surprised at the obvious intelligence of the writing here, or the foreboding and beauty of the music behind it. It would have been more discomfiting to reckon with the intense strangeness of lyrics that seem several worlds away from the crush-love-heartbreak-repeat cycle of the pop music Pallett clearly understands so well. Pallett has said that In Conflict is the first of his records on which he tried to write lyrics that were both non-allegorical and autobiographical. But even if the material \"I Am Not Afraid\" draws upon comes from Pallett’s own life, the song is extraordinarily rich in imagery and metaphor, whether it’s Pallett leaving his \"violin unattended in a cab or restaurant\" or sharing lyrics like \"They told me to chew on a toothpick/ They told me to take a deep breath.\" These are depictions of anxiety and anger—heady emotions clashing with the record’s central message that its subject is not afraid and salvation may be found in discipline. So while there’s clearly that eponymous conflict in effect here, the idea motivating the song remains fleeting. The music of \"I Am Not Afraid\" is mostly gorgeous as it transitions from violin to piano and back, but it is also strange, and sometimes frightening (a result of Pallett dropping what he calls \"black notes\"—i.e., the exact wrong note for the melody—into the mix). Accepting the discomfort of the very music here, and accepting the discomfort of the lyrics, becomes both a metaphor and a microcosm of the experience that those born into any of the groups that hold dominion (whites, males, cisgenders) must undertake to reckon with their unearned status. To draw on what Pallett has said directly, this musical and lyrical confusion also functions as a metaphor for his own \"displacement and dysphoria.\" By taking the political and rendering it both personal and deliberately inscrutable, Pallett has managed to confound in the best way possible and create a relatable pop experience for voices that are too often ignored. —Jonah Bromwich It’s been an art from blues to Britney: the song as extended double entendre, one that can come off either unassailably clean or unspeakably filthy depending on the listener’s life experience and cleanliness of mind (or nearness to a Google searchbox). \"Love Me Harder\" is sort of the opposite: even when it’s clean it sounds teasingly off, and even when it’s dirty, it sounds so disarmingly spit-shine clean. Much of it’s the premise: pairing a singer who was a babysitter on Nickelodeon less than half a year ago with a singer whose discography contains endless variations on permanently corrupting young ingenues, with no apologies and no inclinations to change that. Even more of it’s the execution: organ peals timed like winks after each line; Grande switching emotional beats like poses, her voice either knowing beyond her years or just polished to sound like it, with no indication as to which; Tesfaye revisiting the sturdy nocturnal electro-house of his Kavinsky collaboration (a sound that’s been fast adopted by the pop trickbook, from megastars to newcomers), leering about his rep and finding a way to describe hardcore porn acts in PG terms. When these tracks fail, they’re the most embarrassing failures an artist can have; when they succeed, the sleight of song can be breathtaking. Here’s to a generation of kids realizing horrifying things in 2020 about their teenage jam—and what lodged it in their mind. —Katherine St. Asaph Ariana Grande: \"Love Me Harder\" [ft. The Weeknd] Tobias Jesso Jr. isn't the first guy to have his heart squashed by Los Angeles. After failing to make it as a pop songwriter, breaking up with his girlfriend, getting hit by a car, and—icing on the cake—moving to to Vancouver to help care for his ailing mother, balloons fell from the ceiling as Jesso became the world's one billionth failed songwriter. So he dusted off his sister's old piano, wrote a few heart-stricken ballads, and posted them to Youtube. What happened next was unlikely: An email to Chet \"JR\" White (whose band Girls had just broken up) led to a True Panther signing and bam—Jesso's back on his feet, with a debut tiled Goon slated for next year. His breakthrough track, \"True Love\", is perhaps an even less likely success. About as bald-faced and hopelessly romantic as music in 2014 comes, Jesso calls on the spirits of the underdog singer-songwriters of the '70s (think Randy Newman circa Good Old Boys), nicks the melody from Nelly's \"Dilemma\" almost wholesale, and delivers one of the best lump-in-your throat choruses of the year. Which isn't to mention that it sounds like a half-tempo version of the saddest '80s sitcom theme song ever recorded. But there's something so worn and natural about it, it's hard to think of it as anything but the purest declaration of the heart. Call up the YouTube video for \"True Love\", and you'll find a family photograph of Jesso at maybe seven or eight-years-old, looking up at the camera with his fingers poking at a cheap Casio keyboard. It's hard not to believe the kid would make it after all. —Zach Kelly Tobias Jesso Jr.: \"True Love\" Beyoncé hasn’t been a traditional singles artist for years—4, her 2011 opus, didn’t even put anything in the top 10. And when you Beyoncé not only an album into the world but over a dozen songs with prime-time-ready videos, the formula’s bound to be shaken even further. The obvious industry singles—Ryan Tedder collab \"XO\", erstwhile Katy Perry song \"Pretty Hurts\", whatever “Standing on the Sun” was supposed to be in the months Before Knowles—floundered; even \"Drunk in Love\", a bona fide hit that rode the pomp and TV performance circuit to No. 2, seemed more like a populist underdog fighting chart trends than a preordained smash. Yet there were alternatives: 14 songs, all different, yet each personality-packed, like a personality quiz without any of the data-mining malaise—except the sort that produces people’s-choice singles. And the people’s choice, it turns out, was \"Partition\". If Beyoncé-the-statement was reducible to a single track, this would be it. Jay-Z asserts his presence without actually commandeering the track to rap about breastses and breakfast. Beyoncé thoroughly enjoys her reverie, fetishizing their own celebrity because who else gets to do it? And the track balances no-nonsense hitmaking—the hook’s her most traditionally urban radio-ready since B’Day, the beat roaring from simmer to insatiable and back within seconds—and nonchalant trolling. If you think \"Partition\" is a load of oversharing in a cab seat, Beyoncé is mocking you via a French Big Lebowski lecture. If you think \"Partition\" is a big cameras-flashing FEMINIST TRIUMPH, Beyoncé will make you frame that around a goofy Big Lebowski quote, knowing you’ll share it on all platforms anyway. It’s provocative, let’s say; it gets the people going. —Katherine St. Asaph It wasn’t so long ago that being a Young Thug fan felt like you were in on rap’s most rewarding secret. Revelling in the unpredictability of his I Came From Nothing mixtape series, I can honestly admit that, no, I didn’t see his success coming: even at his poppiest, Thug felt way too weird to transcend cult status. Even on his breakthrough release, 2013’s 1017 Thug, the bits that rose to the top were highly tweetable but barely marketable; keep in mind, this was still pre-\"Versace\", a song that would be used as a punchline by \"serious\" rap fans as often as it would be celebrated later that year. That feels like ages ago. Thug closes 2014 as, if not quite a household name, an unavoidable presence in the rap landscape. A short list of stars who co-opted his once-singular swag this year includes Nicki Minaj, T.I., Gucci Mane, and Lil Wayne (his closest spiritual progenitor, who at this point feels prudish in relation), not to mention the dozens of impressionable ATLiens who’ve practically made his yelps and chirps into its own subgenre. It isn’t that Thug’s succeeded in spite of his quirks: they’ve become the hook. The odder he gets, the more people respond, his endless idiosyncrasies feeding the insatiable demand for clicks that’s come to reshape online media. Such a near-sighted focus on the \"weirdness\" sells Thug short. Of his three major singles this year, each highlighted a distinct facet of his skill set. \"Danny Glover\" was peak zaniness, probing the outer limits of what constitutes catchiness; \"The Blanguage\", in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin, presented Thug as a deft lyricist and effective balladeer. But best of all was \"Stoner\", in which words fell short as descriptors and functioned instead as measurements of rhythm and space. If anything, it made more sense as a grime song than a rap song, with Dun Deal’s spare beat challenging Thug to find new ways to make himself comfortable within it. It struck a precarious balance between restraint and release: an unsure hand could've sent the whole thing toppling. It wasn’t weird—it was masterful. —Meaghan Garvey Young Thug: \"Stoner\" There are qualities about Mike Hadreas that make him seem heroic: His songbook takes on themes of trauma and addiction, the body and identity, all in a way that seems designed to protect us—a reminder that we're not alone in our otherness. This year, Hadreas has been selling T-shirts depicting an emasculated Eminem, a proper jab at one of popular music's most problematic living artists. On the shirt, Slim is clad in coral lipstick, just a few shades lighter than the tint Hadreas wore on his watershed \"Letterman\" performance in October, contorting a slow, sultry sway through \"Queen\". Indeed, Hadreas' work as Perfume Genius has opened a crucial dialogue over the past half decade. Recall the 2012 incident with his 16-second YouTube ad for Put Your Back N 2 It getting censored for \"promoting mature sexual themes\" because it featured two shirtless men hugging. As there's no shortage of topless folks on YouTube, the message from Google was clear: it was the queerness that was unsuitable and—as the corporation wrote in a statement—\"not family safe.\" And so, should you need convincing, the quaking \"Queen\" is empirically necessary. \"No family is safe/ When I sashay,\" Hadreas asserts through expressive breaths on the refrain of the year, channeling personal rage into a surreal energy, addressing gay panic—the idea that one's visible otherness as a gay individual makes people uncomfortable, that it’s perceived as a threat to the straight world. Hadreas sounds just as defiant and poetic in 2014 as Patti Smith did in 1975 telling us how Jesus did not die for her sins. And like Smith's earth-shattering subversions of the female archetype, Hadreas' provocations are confident, uncompromising, epic—he appoints himself \"queen\" and owns the supposed flaws of his sexuality (\"cracked, peeling, riddled with disease\") with a deviant wink and demonic smirk. One would expect music that is both radically politicized and universal from someone who grew up listening to \"a lot of badass feminist music\" and who says he's seen Sleater-Kinney at least 13 times. His words alone have such inspired power—imagine them publicly broadcast on a marquee in LED lighting, like a Jenny Holzer installation—but \"Queen\" does not just illuminate the potential of explicit language. It has few aesthetic precedents, though it pushes the borders of pop and avant-gardism in a way Arthur Russell would have appreciated. The cool drag of a drum contribution from PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish morphed the song into what has been aptly described in interviews as \"stoner glam.\" There is a tornado swirling—a deep, booming low-end; abrasive synths rolling into an ecstatic dreamscape; passing clouds made of soul—and Hadreas is at the eye of the storm, a light steadily beaming from the chaos of the world, stepping into the future. \"Queen\" is a gay anthem, but it also empathizes broadly with all people who biologically have less direct access to the top seats in society. In a year that rendered the world's rampant, widespread injustice so depressingly apparent, what could keep us believing that all this music stuff matters so much? It's songs like \"Queen\" and the sea changes they summon that give it purpose. The future of pop belongs to people like Hadreas, who will take us forward to new places we didn't know we needed to go. Surrounded by this loud, extreme music, it sounds like nothing can hurt him now. —Jenn Pelly Perfume Genius: \"Queen\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Commentators are probably right in assessing that Brianna Keilar’s CNN interview with Hillary Clinton was not quite the love-in that many of us anticipated. (See Jim Geraghty’s review of the Clinton interview, here.) Still, you have to mourn the media’s lack of self-respect: as Jim pointed out in Wednesday’s Morning Jolt, Mrs. Clinton blatantly lied when she claimed, “I’ve never had a subpoena” from a congressional committee regarding Benghazi. There was nothing subtle about it. Clinton was totally banking on CNN’s inclination to let her slide. Well, they don’t call it the Clinton News Network for nothing. It is the network of Candy Crowley, who in the middle of a presidential candidates’ debate couldn’t restrain herself from inappropriately challenging – and misleadingly correcting – Mitt Romney’s remarks about Benghazi. But somehow, when Benghazi came up in a one-on-one media interview setting, CNN couldn’t bring itself to call Mrs. Clinton on an obvious lie. It is well known that Mrs. Clinton was subpoenaed in March by the House select committee investigating the Benghazi Massacre. The matter is indisputable. Plus, it was Keilar who brought up the subject of the subpoena, so one has to assume she did a modicum of research – which is all it would have taken to be ready to challenge Clinton’s false assertion. Yet, in the context of being asked about her destruction of emails from her private server, Clinton was permitted to tell the public she had not been subpoenaed. Thus, without impunity, she was able to frame suspicions that she has willfully obstructed probes of the Benghazi Massacre as outlandish. Jim notes that, in March, Chairman Trey Gowdy’s Benghazi committee released a public statement reporting that it had “issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya.” Moreover, we also know that Benghazi Committee Democrats – apparently thinking it would help Mrs. Clinton(!) – publicly released a March 27 letter from Clinton’s counsel, David Kendall, in which the subpoena is acknowledged and analyzed at length. In the letter (which Shannen Coffin discussed here at National Review back in March), Kendall states that the Committee issued a “subpoena duces tecum” – essentially, a subpoena that compels the witness to produce documents. The subpoena demanded production of “documents, for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.” Those would be (a) the eight months before the September 11, 2012, Benghazi Massacre, when security at the State Department compound was reduced despite jihadist attacks and an intensified terrorist threat, and (b) the three-and-a-half months after the attack, when the administration misled the public about the nature of the attack and identity of the attackers while trumping up a prosecution against the producer of the Innocence of Muslims video, on which the administration fraudulently blamed the murders of four Americans. The documents called for by the subpoena are those “referring or relating to” the following for categories: “Libya (including but not limited to Benghazi and Tripoli)”; “Weapons located or found in, imported or brought into, and/or exported or removed from Libya”; “The attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012”; “Statements pertaining to the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012.” There is no question that the subpoena was issued to Mrs. Clinton personally. Kendall says it was “issued by the Benghazi Select Committee to the Hon. Hillary R. Clinton.” Furthermore, by mutual agreement between the committee and the Clinton camp, it was served on Mrs. Clinton, apparently by delivery to her agent for that purpose (probably Mr. Kendall’s firm, but the letter doesn’t say). Kendall is Mrs. Clinton’s personal attorney, and his letter states that the subpoena was “served by agreement on March 4, 2015.” Given that Chairman Gowdy is an experienced litigator and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton was represented by counsel, it was consistent with professional ethical rules to arrange delivery of the subpoena – and discuss the subpoena thereafter – with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer. And, of course, Mrs. Clinton is also a lawyer with congressional committee experience – she is well aware that service of process upon a witness’s agent by consensual arrangement with witness’s lawyer is the legal and factual equivalent of personal service on the witness. In addition, it is quite apparent that Kendall could not have written a letter extensively responding to the subpoena requests without first having discussed the subpoena with his client, Mrs. Clinton. When Hillary Clinton told CNN, “I’ve never had a subpoena,” she was lying. Since that is what Mrs. Clinton often does, a reporter who fails to challenge her – in an interview for which the reporter had lots of time to prepare, and on a subject the reporter brought up – must be either incompetent or colluding in the lie. Such collusion might be because the reporter supports the candidate, the reporter and her network want to maintain access the candidate, or both. I don’t think Ms. Keilar is incompetent.",

    "DiffbotBody": "City Paper grade: B+ You've never seen anything like Matthew Heineman's , a shot-from-the-hip documentary that follows the fight against Mexican drug syndicates from multiple sides. Heineman, who often composed a camera crew of one, insinuates himself into a methamphetamine cook run by masked bandits who bear little resemblance to Bryan Cranston; trolls alongside a self-appointed border patrol agent on the U.S. side whose jingoistic beliefs shade into predictable racism; and, most profitably, shadows the charismatic leader of an anti-cartel militia in Michoacán, Mexico. José Manuel Mireles Valverde, a small-town physician whom his followers call \"El doctor,\" takes a bold stand against both drug traffickers and the corrupt national government, but the movie quickly reveals his increasing power fomenting its own moral struggles. Mireles' Autodefensas aren't picky about whom they label a cartel associate, leading to some terrifying scenes where you feel seconds away from watching an innocent person gunned down in the street, and as the militias become more powerful, they, too, become objects of the cartels' graft. Heineman's attempt to run the vigilantes' stories on both sides of the border in parallel — despite the fact that one is fighting a largely imaginary threat, the other a very real one — leads to tricky questions never quite reckons with. But it's undeniably thrilling, even as the ends to which that aesthetic is put to use remain disquieting.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Steven Moffat's new 'Sherlock' special puts the infamous detective and his partner, Watson, back in Victorian England. Fans got a preview today at Comic-Con 2015 during a panel discussion. (Photo : PBS) A sneak peek of the new Sherlock special has finally arrived with a premiere at Comic-Con in San Diego, taking fans back to 221B Baker Street - with a slightly historical twist. The standalone special, which will kickstart season 4 of the much-loved British series, will be set in Victorian London. The decision could be construed as a throwback to the setting of the original books written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a contemporary to his own fictional creations. In a Comic-Con panel alongside Rupert Graves and Sue Vertue, Sherlock creator and showrunner Steven Moffat cheekily explained the creative team's \"conundrum\" in putting Sherlock back into his usual, historical time slot: \"When we first did Sherlock, press asked how can Sherlock possibly survive in a world with an iPhone? And when doing the Victorian, the press came in and said how can he do this without his iPhone?\" \"It's very much the show you know. It's the Sherlock as you know it, but in the correct era. It's one of the best ones we've made. I think it's really terrific,\" he concluded. Moffat also announced that the spinoff will also be shown in select theaters worldwide \"on the big screen: full-size Benedict and Martin,\" he joked. As of now, the special is slated for release later this year. Check out the Sherlock sneak peek below. Via Entertainment Weekly Be sure to follow T-Lounge on Twitter and visit our Facebook page.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The superintendent got a vote of confidence. He deserves the Medal of Honor IN A VOTE of confidence, the School Reform Commission last week said it owed Superintendent William Hite what it called a \"performance bonus.\" It should have been called combat pay. That's the extra pay given to members of the U.S. military who serve in \"designated combat zones or hazardous duty areas.\" That pretty much describes the Philadelphia School District, certainly in 2012 when Hite took over after the SRC fired Superintendent Arlene Ackerman. They were perilous times, certainly for the students in the District. The state has slashed about $500 million in aid, creating a huge hole in the district's budget. A round of layoffs - that would continue for several years - was just beginning. Ackerman, whose imperious style earned her the nickname \"Queen Arlene,\" had a knack for making enemies, so the District had few friends in the outside world, especially among the politicians who controlled the purse strings. Hite was the calm after the Ackerman storm. A Virginian with a courtly manner, Hite began his career as a classroom teacher, rising through the ranks to become superintendent of public schools in Prince George's County, in Maryland. It was a large district, though nothing could fully prepare him for the challenge of running an urban school district in the battlefield called Philadelphia. What he was able to draw upon are character traits that make him a good leader. He has offered a consistency of vision, a pro-child and pro-parent agenda, a genuine belief that every child can learn and a determination about making real change in how schools operate in this city. What Hite also brought to the table was a personality that won over critics. He never raises his voice. He never points his finger to blame. He exhibits patience and forbearance - even in the face of screaming protesters or angry lawmakers. Instead, he has countered with a call for \"shared sacrifices\" by all parties involved in education in the city to pull the District out of the hole it fell into before he arrived. We can't say he has succeeded, but that failure is due to forces outside of his control. With the notable exception of Mayor Nutter, he has not gotten much from the political class. He's still at loggerheads with the teachers union over concessions he's sought. Financially, the district is no longer under siege but it's still a combat zone. Services are at a minimal level. Resources are scant. This week, Hite moved ahead with changes he had been planning centered on decentralizing power in the district, reasoning that if he waited for needed money to arrive he could be waiting forever. That is called optimism. He has restored the reputation to a system that was so lacking when he arrived. That is called credibility. He has consistently shown grace under pressure, which is one definition of courage. Hite makes a good salary. But, it's no surprise, given his performance, that the SRC wanted to give him a $60,000 bonus. And it's no surprise that Hite turned it down, saying it would be unfair given the district's finances. We call that leadership.",

    "DiffbotBody": "By GEORGE JAHN and MATTHEW LEE, Associated Press VIENNA (AP) — As negotiators at Iran nuclear talks labored to make headway, the country's supreme leader called Saturday for the struggle against the U.S. to continue, in comments suggesting that Tehran's distrust of Washington will persist no matter what the outcome of the talks. The negotiations entered their 15th day Saturday with no indications of major progress after three extensions and four target dates for a deal, and diplomats said it remained unclear whether an agreement could be reached by Monday, the latest deadline. Iran and the U.S. have threatened to walk away unless the other side makes concessions. Although it was unclear whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was preparing the ground for the failure of the talks, his comments were likely to add to skepticism over the outcome at the negotiating table. Iran's state-run Press TV cited Khamenei as calling the U.S. an \"excellent example of arrogance.\" It said Khamenei told university students in Tehran to be \"prepared to continue the struggle against arrogant powers.\" Even if Khamenei isn't signaling that the talks have failed, his comments appear to be a blow to U.S. hopes that an agreement will lead to improved bilateral relations that could translate into increased cooperation in a common cause — the fight against Islamic radicals. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had hinted at just that last week, suggesting a deal acceptable to his country will open the door to joint efforts on that front. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani indicated talks could go either way. \"We behaved so skillfully that if talks won't succeed, the world would accept that Iran is for logic and dialogue and never left the negotiating table ... and if we succeed by the grace of God, the world will know that the Iranian nation can resolve its problems through logic,\" his website quoted him as saying. Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met again Saturday, this time with European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini present. Of the chief diplomats of the six countries negotiating with Iran, British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond and Foreign Ministers Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany and Laurent Fabius of France also are already in Vienna. Kerry spoke by telephone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Chinese and Russian foreign ministers have said they will come to Vienna if a deal appears close. On Friday, Kerry suggested that some progress had been made, telling reporters that the \"atmosphere is very constructive,\" but stressing that \"very difficult issues\" remained to be resolved. Since the start of the current round 15 days ago, he has said twice that the negotiations couldn't be open-ended and warned that the U.S. was prepared to call an end to the talks. Any deal is meant to clamp long-term and verifiable restrictions on Iranian nuclear programs that are technically adaptable to make weapons in exchange for sanctions relief for Tehran. The scope of access to U.N. inspectors monitoring Iran's nuclear program remains a sticking point. The Americans want no restrictions. Iranian officials say unrestricted monitoring could be a cover for Western spying. Diplomats say Iran's negotiators have signaled a willingness to compromise, but hardliners in Iran remain opposed to broad U.N. inspections. Another unresolved matter is Iran's demand for a U.N. arms embargo to be lifted as part of sanctions relief, a stance supported by Russia and China but opposed by the U.S. and some Europeans. The current round was supposed to conclude on June 30, but was extended until July 7, then July 10 and now July 13. The sides had hoped to seal a deal before the end of Thursday in Washington to avoid delays in implementing their promises. By missing that target, the U.S. and Iran now have to wait for a 60-day congressional review period during which President Barack Obama can't waive sanctions on Iran. Had they reached a deal by Thursday, the review would have been only 30 days. Iran is unlikely to begin a substantial rollback of its nuclear program until it gets sanctions relief in return. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the talks have gone past four deadlines and into three extensions. ___ Associated Press writer Ali Akbar Dareini contributed to this report.

    "DiffbotBody": "Ships. Opium chests. Choppy waters. Warring continents. Flood of Fire, the much-awaited finale to the Ibis Trilogy is packed with all of the above, and much more. Recently, Amitav Ghosh gave Mumbai fans a taste of this heady adventure. Fiona Fernandez met with him to get the back-story of his epic work of historic fiction George Wittet's Gateway of India has a grey hue to it. After all, it's pouring outside. The monsoon is here, we're told. Call it timing or otherwise; we couldn't help but imagine similar brushstrokes paint a vivid picture from 1839-40, in the torrential waters around south China — the area where Amitav Ghosh's Flood of Fire ends in fine form. \"Yes, River of Smoke was launched around this time, too,\" smiles Ghosh when we remind him of the monsoon connect. Our introductions revisited, we are ready to set sail. Pun intended. \"I love being on water,\" when we prod early on, about why a ship forms such an integral part to the trilogy. \"It's such a wonderful thing to write about. It provides you with classical elements like time, place and action. So much can happen in a concentration of space. No wonder Agatha Christie wrote several titles centred on ships,\" he says, with a twinkle in his eye. Despite a packed, superhit launch (Aamir Khan was in the audience) the previous (Friday) evening, there's no trace of fatigue. This, even if we were to factor in an engaging one-hour interaction (Meeting Amitav Ghosh) with nine mid-day readers, barely an hour earlier. Easing into the conversation, he's happy with the way the Ibis Trilogy turned out. \"As I came to the end, it felt satisfying. I am glad with the way it worked itself out. I felt as if I was taking dictation from the book! It was on its own track,\" he quips, to which I ask, \"…like a boatman?\" Ghosh agrees, and we can gauge sea connect. Little wonder then, that when we speak a few moments later about the wondrous mix of languages and dialects in the trilogy, he shares about how nautical language was easy to incorporate — \"I grew up in Sri Lanka, where it's spoken freely. Sri Lanka (Ceylon) was an important stop for wayfarers and traders. Interestingly, I came across similar phraseology in Mauritius as well,\" he elaborates, helping me join the dots. By now, we're soaked in a socio-cultural lesson. The interview must make a re-entry, we realise, before our scheduled time slot runs out. Of characters and challenges So, we ask Ghosh to pick favourites from the trilogy. With a bunch of eclectic, insightful characters, each with their set of quirks, \"It's tough for me,\" he grins. \"They've all been difficult to create. A short pause later, he reveals, \"Bahram Modi was a great challenge. He was a businessman from Bombay who was dealing with opium. I had to enter a world that I was not accustomed to. It was a rewarding experience, especially from a sympathetic standpoint. In fact, he was the second character (Deeti was the first) that I thought of, when I began work on the trilogy. He has a very vivid presence, and is one of the most interesting characters in my entire writing life.\" When we nudge a bit, on whether he missed Bahram in the final book, he adds, \"He was there in spirit. But his wife Shireen was an interesting character as well. It's easy to relate to her, isn't it?\" As we carry on our discussion of the book's central characters — Mr and Mrs Burnham, Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesri and Neel, it's insightful to listen to (and read, earlier) the wizardry with which the reader goes on a seamless ride that pans continents and cultures, separated by water. \"How do you manage to balance the pace of one story such that it doesn't outdo the other?\" we quiz the Kolkata-born author. \"Well, I wish I had the answer!\" he shrugs, sharing a grin. \"At some basic level, it's about instinct. Besides, while working on such a long book, one cannot merely depend on the flow.\" Anybody who has read the trilogy will vouch for the imagery that takes over almost immediately. Like it did in our case. So when talk veers to these intrinsic elements to his craft, he replies, \"I think in a visual way. To be able to write a scene, I need to see it. It's the best compliment if my reader can also do this, while reading it.\" This, we were able to — from the moment we walked into our interview, forty minutes earlier, when dark clouds gathered over the Arabian Sea, in the picture postcard-like view from the hotel window. Just as Ghosh had imagined, possibly, when Bahram, and later, Shireen had set sail, as they stood on the threshold of rewriting their destinies. Quick bites On sailing the seas: I love to head out on sail ships. Most recently, my wife and I did this wonderful trip on an Indonesian cruise called Bugis Schooners. These cruise boats were originally made by a seafaring community called the Bugis. I found it was fascinating to experience Indonesia via water, what with thousands of islands that one encounters along the way. This included a visit to the Komodo Islands too, where we were greeted by many Komodo Dragons! On mastering languages: (laughs) I'm familiar with English, Bengali and Hindi, of course. Then, there's Arabic, and also Bhojpuri, which I learnt from my father who lived in those parts. This helped while writing Kesri's story. As for the language of the boat people, I researched from the archives in China. What's next? There are two non-fiction works. One of these is based on the research that emerged from the trilogy. The second will be based on a series of lectures that I conducted back in the United States. Climate change matters: What I would like to see is large-scale renewable energy sources that are easily possible and available in India. Instead of subsidising gas and power, why not offer subsidies for solar panels? After all, India is blessed with adequate sunlight. This strikes me most viscerally. Even in my home in Goa, I've tried to install solar panels, but have been plagued by so many obstacles. (Amitav Ghosh is a leading world voice who speaks on environmental issues and impact of climate change) Will there be a TV or film series based on the ibis trilogy? Yes, people have approached me in the past. But I don't think about it (smiles). Meeting Amitav Ghosh Malabi Das, one of the nine mid-day readers who participated in a Meet the Author contest held by the newspaper, won her a chance to interact with Amitav Ghosh yesterday. She narrates the experience The Ibis trilogy is complete; the Flood of Fire is on the stands; and, I am going to meet Amitav Ghosh! I could hardly believe it. And, there I was shaking hands with him; sharing a table with a bunch of very informed fans of the celebrated author. I went to the reader's session with Amitav without any expectation, but I came out smiling like a cat who got the cream. Did you know that Amitav Ghosh writes his first draft with a pencil on a sketch pad and the second draft with pen on ruled paper? And that he probably writes 30-40 drafts by the time his novel was done? In the warm, friendly atmosphere of the Business Centre at the Taj Mahal Hotel, Ghosh let us peep into his world — the world of Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesari, Shireen Modi, and Neel. So, how did he go about completing this colossal project — how did he handle the enormous historical data and weave it into these amazing works of fiction? \"Writing is like mediation. Every morning I sit on my writing desk and let my mind calm down, till it is like still water, and then I start to write,\" explains Amitav. Now that the Ibis trilogy is complete what can we expect from Amitav's desk next? It may not be another work of fiction for some time, but we can look forward to some non-fiction that he is currently working on. I must admit, I like his non-fiction as much as I enjoy his works of fiction. Thank you, mid-day! Signing off to return to my autographed copy of Flood of Fire (I am abandoning my copy on Kindle in favour of the hardbound courtesy, mid-day and Penguin Random House.)",

A third vehicle, a 2001 Toyota sedan driven by an Easthampton woman, came up from behind and slammed into the back of the Subaru, causing that vehicle to hit the back of the Chevrolet, Green said. The accident was reported at 4:45 p.m. Green did not identify anyone in the vehicles, and their ages were not available. The woman driving the Chevrolet and her two passengers, also women from Hadley, were taken to Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton with non-life-threatening injuries, Green said.

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",
    "LabBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South. Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting. Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project. At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s been a rough few weeks for Sarah Palin… Last month, the country was shocked when her daughter Bristol Palin called off her wedding to Sgt. Dakota Meyer just days before it was set to take place amidst claims he had been married to a “secret wife” years before. Weeks later, it was revealed that Bristol is currently pregnant with her second child out of wedlock, and she has no plans to get married anytime soon. In the middle of those scandals, Fox News parted ways with Palin when they decided not to renew her million dollar contract last month. Now, Palin has just quietly announced that she will be shutting down the subscription-based sarahpalinchannel.com just a year after it debuted. According to Mediaite, the site offered exclusive Palin content for an annual subscription fee of $99.95, and they will now be giving a refund for the remainder of the year to all customers. Here’s the full statement the Palins put on the website: Effective August 1st, the Governor will be making all of her content free on her Facebook page and at SarahPac.com. • If you are a monthly subscriber here on SarahPalinChannel.com, you will not be charged anything after this month. There’s nothing that you need to do. • If you are an annual subscriber, you can have the balance of your subscription refunded to your credit card or you can roll your subscription into one of the other channels on our network. If you choose this option, you’ll get an EXTRA month absolutely FREE. Our networks include: – New Life TV – Recharge your relationships and grow closer to God – Alive with Joan Lunden – A vibrant community for women’s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors – K-Love TV – Christian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values Palin also issued a video message in which she did her best to make the change look like a positive thing. “It’s starting August 1st, everything’s free, and just to let you know, that it is an honor to have you subscribe, really it’s been so illuminating and still is so illuminating to read and to respond to many of your insightful comments about current events, about so many things going on in our world today,” Palin said in her video message. She went on to claim that this decision to make all content free stems from a desire to, “make sure that your voices and mine are heard by the widest possible audience across this great land of ours” during the next election. While this sounds nice, it also reveals that Palin was not getting the amount of subscribers she was looking for. She would not be making all the content free if she was making a good amount of money with subscribers, so this change reveals that Palin is not doing as well business-wise as she might have thought. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the entire Palin family. We need to keep them in our prayers!",

At the time, he deemed the justices to have “[overruled] the people of this state, who have clearly supported the Kansas Constitution’s definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman.” Now, Brownback is doing everything he can to protect that definition — or, at least, enable others to discriminate against married same-sex couples. In an Executive Order signed this week, the state of Kansas is prevented from taking action against “any individual clergy, religious leader, or religious organization” if they have “a religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.” The order matches protections already offered by Kansas’ Constitution, but Brownback felt compelled to ensure that religious individuals or groups could refuse to accept same-sex couples without fear of repercussion. “We have a duty to govern and to govern in accordance with the Constitution as it has been determined by the Supreme Court decision,” Brownback said in a statement. “We also recognise that religious liberty is at the heart of who we are as Kansans and Americans, and should be protected. While we disagree with the decision of the Supreme Court, it is important that all Kansans be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.” Unsurprisingly, LGBT groups reject Brownback’s justifications for his order. “Having nothing to do with religious freedom and everything to do with enabling discrimination,” Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, told the Washington Post, “this executive order is divisive, unnecessary, and sends the wrong message.” “As a result of (the order), a homeless shelter that received a state contract or grant could refuse family housing to a gay couple with a child,” said Micah Kubic, of ACLU Kansas, “or a foster care agency could refuse to place a child in their custody with the child’s family member just because the family member was in a same-sex relationship — and the state couldn’t require them to treat all families equally.” Rhuaridh Marr is Metro Weekly's assistant editor and covers cars, technology, and gaming.

    "DiffbotBody": "[ PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 2016 ] Republican presidential candidate former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signs autographs following a town hall meeting Wednesday, July 8, 2015, in Hudson, N.H. JIM COLE | THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: Saturday, July 11, 2015 at 12:09 a.m. Last Modified: Saturday, July 11, 2015 at 12:09 a.m. WASHINGTON | Jeb Bush has shattered political fundraising records with a $114 million haul in the first six months of the year, an extraordinary total designed to instill a sense of shock and awe into his Republican competitors. Now, Bush and his allies have to figure out how to spend it. They reported Thursday they have collected more than $114 million through the end of June and reported $98 million in the bank, likely at least twice as much as his next closest Republican competitor and more than the outside group backing President Barack Obama in 2012 raised in two years. \"More than the symbolism of surpassing $100 million, the totals demonstrate Bush's success charting new territory,\" said Bush donor Mark Jacobs, a former Texas energy executive who now lives in Iowa. Bush's team \"has raised more and been more successful than any political organization ever.\" Yet in some ways, now the real test begins. He helped raise the money, but Bush has no direct control over 90 percent of his new haul. The total announced Thursday includes $103 million raised by Right to Rise, a super PAC that will support Bush in the crowded GOP contest. The rest, $11.4 million, came into Bush's formal campaign. By law, the super PAC can't take direction from Bush's Miami-based campaign, and the two operations have limits on how they can communicate. Based in Los Angeles, Right to Rise will handle a huge part of the costly work of running for president, including buying TV, online and radio commercials, conducting polling and even doing some organizing tasks such as voter outreach in early primary states. Bush's official campaign and its markedly smaller bank account will pay for his travel and employee salaries, and give him a pot of money from which to craft messages exactly as he sees fit. Designed with longtime aides Sally Bradshaw, who now leads the campaign, and Mike Murphy, who now leads the super PAC, it's a strategy untested in modern politics. Right to Rise already is advertising on Bush's behalf. It has spent $47,000 so far on digital media, according to documents filed this week with the Federal Election Commission. The group has also inquired with broadcast and cable stations in the early primary states about booking TV ad time. The campaign's broader strategy — and continued fundraising efforts — will be a focus this weekend as Bush gathers with top donors at his family's Kennebunkport, Maine, compound. In exchange for gathering $27,000 worth of donations in the first 15 days of the campaign, donors were rewarded with an \"evening picnic\" with Bush and his parents, former President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and a morning \"political and campaign briefing\" with senior campaign officials. In announcing its fundraising Thursday, Right to Rise said it had about 9,400 donors who had given $25,000 or less, and about 500 who'd given more. Having made its mark in the big-money chase, the Bush campaign is focusing now on finding and cultivating small donors— people who would chip in $25 or so a few times over the Internet. Separately, Jay Zeidman, a Houston-based fundraiser for Bush, said the campaign is focused on continuing to build on its initial $11.4 million because \"those dollars are very, very important. It's the front lines, the boots on the ground. The campaign is definitely front and center now.\" While the super PAC can accept unlimited donations, Bush's formal campaign operates in far more restrictive territory. Individual donors can't give more than $2,700 to the primary elections and, if Bush wins the GOP nomination, $2,700 he can spend in the general election. In all, Bush's campaign raised $11.4 million — or an average of $710,000 per day — through the end of June. The campaign touted that daily average as more than the average of $562,000 per day raised by Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton since she launched her campaign April 12. Clinton's haul in that time totaled $45 million. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition. All rights reserved.

Synergy between social cause and brand positioning Amongst our yearly Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, the computer education programme is perhaps a first-of-its-kind initiative, aimed at imparting computer skills and Internet knowledge to senior citizens and housewives to use the Web in their daily lives. This programme was extensively driven in 34 cities across 10 states in India. With an illiteracy rate of more than 25% and digital literacy almost non-existent among more than 90% of India’s population, our computer education programme has been instrumental in addressing the cause of digital literacy, which is integral to India’s inclusive growth. India has experienced impressive economic growth in the last couple of years. But for this growth to be truly sustainable in the long run, we need to have a much larger section of the population participating in the national economic agenda and playing a critical role in the momentum of the growth engines. This initiative was driven in alignment not only with our organizational goals of enabling socio-economic change, but also with the role of repositioning news media company as a catalyst in bridging the digital divide. The initiative infused great confidence amongst the trainees and made them competent enough to be in sync with today’s generation. As part of the programme, a specially designed content booklet was given to the trainees that helped them in understanding the nuances of the following: Computer basics: Starting and shutting down a computer system, using Microsoft Word and a microphone and Webcam to interact with others in a new way. Internet skills: Browsing the Internet, creating an e-mail account, sending and reading e-mails, and searching information online for hospitals, banks, and recipes. Other digital skills: Using WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, and other digital applications. The course allowed senior citizens to chat with their children and grandchildren in different cities or abroad. Housewives learned to make online reservations, shop online, and read mythological stories and ancient history online. The trainees were awarded certificates on successful completion of the programme. To date, the programme has had more than 56,000 registrants. Integration of social cause with the product brand At Dainik Bhaskar Group, we believe that media has a critical role to play in addressing our nation’s social problems, thereby helping the government to achieve inclusive growth of our nation. The barometer of any social initiative’s success depends on awareness-building and active stakeholder engagement. We launched the initiative via print ads and on-the-ground activities across 34 cities in India. The initiative also was featured on the national editorial page. It was also extensively driven on the digital platform to generate awareness about the programme. In addition to driving the initiative extensively through print and digital media, we also partnered with HelpAge India, an NGO advocating for the elderly. This kind of partnership promoted a sense of ownership and enhanced the overall sustainability of the campaign. On the whole, the evolved model of CSR is not something that is static. Rather, it is about creating shared value by leveraging the core competence of our brand towards the betterment of the society.

This kind of partnership promoted a sense of ownership and enhanced the overall sustainability of the campaign. On the whole, the evolved model of CSR is not something that is static. Rather, it is about creating shared value by leveraging the core competence of our brand towards the betterment of the society.

(MICHAEL PATRICK/NEWS SENTINEL) Maryville lawyer Kevin Shepherd said that by filing a class-action lawsuit Friday, his clients hope to advocate for the 5,000 residents evacuated from their homes during the July 2 CSX train derailment in Blount County. Shepherd’s office filed the lawsuit at 3:10 p.m. Friday in the circuit court for Blount County, with married couple Kelli and Aaron Johnson listed as plaintiffs. Shepherd said the Johnsons, whom he knew personally before acting as their lawyer, have two children younger than 2 and live within the 2-mile radius evacuated during the derailment, though not in the area immediately affected by the spill of the chemical acrylonitrile the derailed tanker was carrying. Shepherd said the Johnsons, who were not available for comment Friday, had no personal medical injuries that they were aware of. He expects individual suits to be filed by people who were hospitalized, he said, and hopes for “long-range medical monitoring” of potential health effects from the chemical. He also noted CSX is compensating residents for business loss and expenses associated with evacuation. Continue reading at the Knoxville News Sentinel. comments powered by Disqus",

    "DiffbotBody": "BENA—While school is out for summer break, administrators at the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig Schools in Bena are taking the opportunity to restructure staffing before student orientation in August. Advertisement The school board approved the hiring of an academic principal and accepted the resignations of a middle school teacher and a Niigaane teacher at Thursday's school board meeting. Niigaane is the school's Ojibwe language immersion academy. Due to personnel procedures, the names of those hired and resigning were not released. During the meeting, human resources director Bridget Sorensen said there are currently several openings being advertised in six newspapers. One vacancy is that of superintendent, currently being filled by special education coordinator Pam Walker who is acting as interim superintendent. The board accepted the resignations of past superintendent Crystal Redgrave and principal Cheryl Poitra at May's school board meeting. The resignations came after a student protest at the school in which the students asked the women resign. The school's new curriculum principal, Amanda Norman, attended her first school board meeting Thursday. Norman, from White Earth, said she is excited to begin work at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig. She has a background in teaching Ojibwe and looks forward to continuing involvement in language revitalization. Prior to joining the staff at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig, Norman taught in Ponemah and before that she was with the St. Paul school district for 11 years. \"Since I was young, I always wanted to teach,\" Norman said prior to the meeting. \"My heart is in instilling confidence in students.\" This is Norman's first week at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig and she has yet to tour the high school building that has been recognized for poor conditions. \"It's definitely a priority, students need a safe environment to learn in,\" Norman said. Walker said the \"Bug School\" is on the Bureau of Indian Education's list for reconstruction money during the board meeting. In addition to staffing, the board approved the appointments of officers for the next year. Rocky Papasodora will remain chairman, Anita Cloud accepted the position of vice chairwoman, Kathy Fairbanks will be secretary and Brenda White was appointed treasurer. During executive session the board heard from the Local Indian Education Committee. The LIEC oversees the operation of the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig school and serves in an advisory capacity to the Leech Lake Reservation Tribal Council.Committee chairman Benjamin Meat said he cannot comment on the topic of discussion. The LIEC presented the board with bylaws during the regular session.",

Well, this isn’t 2006, and Google now says that its Gmail spam filter is more sophisticated than ever, removing 99.9 percent of spam from users’ inboxes with artificial intelligence (AI). The Mountain View-based tech company launched Gmail Postmaster Tools on Thursday to help users filter messages and senders gather more information about reaching their target audiences, according to its Gmail blog. The company is using \"an artificial neural network to detect and block the especially sneaky spam — the kind that could actually pass for wanted mail.\" In addition, Google says its system is getting better at recognizing bulk messages users actually need. “Gmail users get lots of important email from companies like banks and airlines — from monthly statements to ticket receipts — but sometimes these wanted messages are mistakenly classified as spam,” Sri Harsha Somanchi, Google product manager, wrote in the blog post. “When this happens, you might have to wade through your spam folder to find that one important email (yuck!). We can help senders to do better.” How will AI help organize your messages: Average users Google’s spam philosophy for everyday users of Gmail is out of sight, out of mind. “The Gmail team is always working hard to make sure that every message you care about arrives in your inbox, and all the spam you don’t want remains out of sight,” Somanchi wrote. “In fact, less than 0.1 percent of email in the average Gmail inbox is spam, and the amount of wanted mail landing in the spam folder is even lower, at under 0.05 percent.” But Google realizes that one man’s digital trash, is another man’s newsletter about comic books. The company will use machine learning tech to adapt to individuals' inbox needs, creating custom spam filters. “While your neighbor may love weekly email newsletters, you may loathe them,\" Somanchi wrote. \"With advances in machine learning, the spam filter can now reflect these individual preferences.\" Bulk senders There are legitimate bulk senders out there — users who send out receipts, confirmation emails and newsletters. Gmail Postmaster Tools allows qualified high-volume senders to see how Gmail treats their emails. Are they getting to their intended recipients, or are they getting stuck in a filter along the way? The tool has several dashboards that give users insight into their online reputation. Some dashboards show how frequently users report the sender’s emails as spam. Spammers Spammers won’t qualify for access to the new tool, so users won’t have to field more offers for certain “enlargement” procedures or money requests from Nigeria.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Johanna Olson is still changing lives two years after her death. The 2015 Tour des Chutes kicks off today at Bend’s High Lakes Elementary School with more than 1,750 participants expected to ride, run or walk during the 12th annual fundraiser for cancer survivors and their families. The baby of Sunnyside Sports co-owner Gary Bonacker, who was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor in 2003, the Tour des Chutes offers cyclists five ride options, ranging from a family-friendly 7-mile jaunt to a scenic 100-mile adventure that rolls into Smith Rock State Park. For just the second year, the Tour des Chutes will also stage a 5-kilometer run/walk in honor of Olson, a Bend resident and 15-year cancer survivor who died at the age of 33 in 2013. “To have Johanna associated with the Tour des Chutes is such an honor,” says Marney Olson, Johanna Olson’s older sister. “She didn’t live in Bend that long, but she had such an impact in a short time. She really loved that community.” Last year, all the money raised from the Tour des Chutes’ 5K run/walk — and a good amount of funds from the bike ride — $40,000 total, went to the Pediatric Foundation, a Bend nonprofit that gives money to families who have a child with cancer and must travel beyond Central Oregon for treatment. “(Johanna) was really a supporter and champion of others,” Marney Olson says. “Whether it was running or … supporting family and friends through illness, she just genuinely cared about others. It’s amazing how quickly she developed such lasting and grateful friendships and relationships.” A high school cross-country and track standout in Wadena, Minnesota, Olson went on to run — and excel — at NCAA Division III Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. She was a seven-time All-American runner at Luther and in 2000, her senior year, she won the D-III cross-country individual national championship, three years to the day after her first brain surgery. Olson eventually earned a master’s degree from Oregon State University in exercise and sports science — she came to Bend in 2010 to work as an exercise physiologist at Central Oregon Community College — and qualified for the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Trials in the marathon. “Anyone who knew her lights up when they talk about her,” says friend Carrie Morales, who Olson supported while Morales battled thyroid cancer. “She was by my side all five days I was at the hospital. … She embraced me and was there for me emotionally and physically. “Knowing my cancer was very treatable and knowing she was declining, it’s hard not having a little bit of guilt,” Morales adds. “At the same time, I think it was therapeutic for her. She taught me so much about giving back.” Olson, who endured her first brain surgery her freshman year in college, was cancer-free for more than 10 years before a 2009 checkup showed her tumor had returned. She had a second surgery that year and a third 14 months later in September 2011. Johanna Olson died Jan. 3, 2013, less than three months after completing the 2012 Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. “To have the run added to the Tour des Chutes, it such a big thing because as much as a bike rider Gary is, Johanna was that much of a runner,” Marney Olson says. “It’s overwhelming and a perfect way to honor the person she was and is.” If you go What: 2015 Tour des Chutes bicycle ride and run/walk Where: Both the ride and run/walk start and end at High Lakes Elementary, 2500 NW High Lakes Loop, Bend When: Riders leave High Lakes between 6 and 9:30 a.m. today; the run/walk begins at 8 a.m. Notes: The bike ride is full, but runners and walkers can still sign up today at High Lakes, starting at 5:30 a.m.",

Sanchez was arrested on June 22. The victim said she'd been inside the home with Sanchez while the children were outside, the report said. Sanchez said she was going outside for a moment.

This is a story about one media company branching out into the digital world by developing and marketing its own CMS (content management system), responsive Web sites, and apps. If content is king, than entire business should be aligned to ensure seamless content delivery to readers. What does that mean? It means that you need to establish simple yet solid infrastructure and processes that guides staff’s content to the market. The problem here is finding a good CMS that helps facilitate that. Sure, there are some great solutions for soccer moms blogging about their muffin recipes and products that are too complex for their own good. But that’s not what you need in the newsroom. That is your new revenue opportunity. So ... Define the problem: Lack of great CMS solutions for media companies available on the market. Define the need: Intuitive user-centered interface for non-tech-savvy content creators. Assemble a team: Editors, developers, UX designers. Create the product. The beautiful part is by solving your own problem, you create a market-ready product that other publishers also need. And that’s how the Styria CMS system was created. We didn’t start developing CMS on our own with the idea of monetisation in mind. Core business is still core business and solving problem at hand should drive the change. The project originally started as a solution for news portal 24sata.hr. But as it progressed, we realised that CMS could be adjusted to fit other portals in the Styria group. With each new adaptation, the end product was upgraded and became more and more universal. In time, we saw that CMS developed into modular product that can hold its own on the market. When you decide that product has potential to be offered outside of company, you need to find a unique angle. In the case of Styria CMS, our core advantage is acces to leading regional content creators that constantly work with our development team in order to advance the product. That synergy lead to the development of myriad distinct features like: Traffic eco system of widgets and tools designed to increase traffic within the portal network. Multi-site and multi-platform management that allows journalists to share content easily. Reader behaviour analytics that help editors make better content related decisions. It’s a good idea to test and pilot products internally on a smaller scale before going to the market. Our challenge was to design interface with (almost) no learning curve, since a big portion of our content creators aren’t tech-savy. It took a good amount of work to perfect modular user friendly interface that is simple enough, but provides journalists with much needed flexibility (multi-media integration, lists, etc.). Always monitor and measure results. They show if you are on the right track and help down the line to market a product successfully. Never shy away from numbers.

But, that isn’t the key. Corporate culture is crucial. To succeed in the new revenue game, you need to nourish and cultivate an innovation-oriented climate in the company. Early on, Styria set tech and innovation as a strategic imperative. That vision lead us to establish digital team that aimed to push the envelope in every project.

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Evan Abbott, 12, left, Andrew Mauney, 10, center and Ricky Regnier, right, adult leader, work on cleaning a huge bird bath Friday afternoon. Doug Engle/Ocala Star-Banner Published: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 7:31 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 7:31 p.m. A group of 11- and 12-year-olds from Jacksonville were in Ocala this week spending part of their summer vacation helping others. The children were with Highlands Presbyterian Church and were at the Ocala Wildlife Sanctuary, or OWLS, on Friday afternoon. OWLS is a nonprofit rehabilitation and education center that houses more than 100 animals. The animals at the sanctuary include owls, but there are also ducks, chickens, parrots and even a deer named Buttercup. \"These children are performing a selfless act. Most people during summer are on vacation. Hopefully, it will be an inspiration for others,\" said Kenny Lane, vice president of the organization. During their time at the sanctuary, the group helped weed a garden and cleaned fountains used by the birds. About an hour into the visit, the skies opened up thanks to the familiar afternoon storms. The rain, however, did little to dampen the children's enthusiasm. \"I loved the rain. I like to play in the rain when it's not lightning out,\" said Nicole Kleppen, who will enter the seventh grade in the fall. The brief soaking did help take the bite out of the day's high temperatures. \"It's not 120 degrees anymore, so it could be worse,\" said Heather Mauney, one of the group's chaperones. Keith Belisle, OWLS' founder, was taken with the children's attitudes. \"Their personalities are wonderful. Even though it was raining, they were out there laughing and having a good time,\" Belisle said. The sanctuary was the group's last stop and they planned to head back to Jacksonville on Saturday. They arrived on Wednesday and started work on Thursday. They volunteered at Brother's Keeper soup kitchen, a nursing home and at Ocala Equine Rescue. \"The kids have really been excited to give back and serve. They have been learning about different things and how their actions impact more than their little bubble,\" Mauney said. The trip didn't come without a small tragedy or two. Tianna Kleppen's glasses were stepped on and broken. \"It was raining. I wanted to go clean them and they dropped. Then Tiffany, not on purpose, stepped on them and they broke,\" Tianna said. For OWLS, the help came at the perfect time. They are stretched thinly since another area sanctuary closed recently. \"It was a blessing at a time when we needed that extra help,\" Belisle said. Lane agreed. \"They don't realize how much of a difference they are making,\" he said. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition. All rights reserved.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Serena Williams focuses on her return shot in her win over Maria Sharapova in the Wimbledon semifinals. Williams plays Garbine Muguruza in today's final looking to win her 28th straight Grand Slam match, sixth Wimbledon trophy, 21st major title and fourth straight Grand Slam title over two seasons. (Pavel Golovkin | Associated Press) Published: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 6:01 a.m. Last Modified: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 11:43 p.m. LONDON — Turn back the calendar more than a year, to June 28, 2014, when Serena Williams lost to Alize Cornet in the third round at Wimbledon. It was Williams' earliest exit from the All England Club in nearly a decade. It also marked the fourth time in five Grand Slam tournaments she was beaten before the quarterfinals. Now examine what Cornet, who was seeded 25th and only once previously had been as far as the fourth round at a major, said afterward: “It might be a bit premature to talk about her decline, but when she plays someone who finds the right tactics, she looks a bit lost on the court. In my opinion, there are more and more players understanding how to play her.” Oh, really? Where are they hiding? Since that day, Williams has not lost a Grand Slam match, winning 27 in a row — on the hard courts of the U.S. Open and Australian Open, then the red clay of the French Open, and now the grass of Wimbledon — heading into Saturday's final against 21-year-old Garbine Muguruza of Spain. It will be the No. 1-seeded Williams' 25th career Grand Slam title match — she is 20-4 in the others — and the 20th-seeded Muguruza's first. At the Grand Slam tournament that immediately preceded Wimbledon in 2014, the French Open, Williams lost even sooner, 6-2, 6-2 in the second round, her most lopsided defeat in 318 career matches at majors. The opponent that day just so happened to be Muguruza, a big hitter who talks about the importance of putting on a “poker face” during matches. “It was an eye-opening loss for me. Some losses you're angry about, and some losses you learn from. That loss, I think I learned the most from in a long time,” Williams said. “I got so much better after that loss. I was able to improve a lot. I worked on things. I didn't see the results straightaway. But months later, I started seeing the results, more and more.” On Thursday, after Williams easily eliminated 2004 champion Maria Sharapova in the semifinals 6-2, 6-4, the 33-year-old American was asked what she remembers about — and might have learned from — that setback against Cornet at the All England Club. Williams' reply: “Um, you know, not much. I just realized that I just needed to run faster, I guess.” She paused, then smiled broadly and added: “I don't want to talk about that.” Another topic five-time Wimbledon champion Williams has been reluctant to discuss is all that is at stake for her at the conclusion of this fortnight. If she beats Muguruza, Williams will have won her fourth consecutive Grand Slam title over two seasons, completing a self-styled Serena Slam, something she also did in 2002-03. That would also put Williams three-quarters of the way to a true Grand Slam — all four championships in a single year — which was last accomplished by Steffi Graf in 1988. When a reporter made a passing reference to such milestones after a fourth-round victory over older sister Venus on Monday, Williams rested her chin on her left hand and declared: “I no longer answer questions about Grand Slams.” Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gave a glowing scouting report on Muguruza. “She has the perfect game for grass. She serves well, she hits quite flat, takes the ball early, is aggressive,” he said. “It's her first Grand Slam final, so we'll see how, emotionally, she deals with it.” Muguruza is aware that, even if she knows she can beat Williams because she has, Saturday's task will be tough. “Everything always depends on her — it's Serena,” said Muguruza, who has defeated top-10 players Caroline Wozniacki and Angelique Kerber, along with 2015 French Open semifinalist Timea Bacsinszky and 2012 Wimbledon runner-up Agnieszka Radwanska on her road to the final. “It's a match I need to go into with a cool head.” Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

Comment FORT WALTON BEACH - A 54-year-old man is facing felony theft charges after allegedly taking a razor, deodorant and toothpaste. Fort Walton Beach Police officers were called to Publix, 251 Miracle Strip Parkway SE, at 1:20 p.m. on June 19, according to the arrest report. Employees said the suspects were secured in the office and not causing problems. When officers arrived, they were told that the man, Kent Flowers, of Crestview, had shoplifted, the report said. A woman with him had reportedly started to shoplift, but removed all items prior to passing the registers. The theft prevention employee said she'd seen the two walk down the health and beauty aisle, taking several items, according to the report. She said they'd continued throughout the store, putting items, including steaks, in pockets and a large handbag. The woman had removed items in one of the aisles before leaving, the report said. Flowers, however, allegedly tried to leave with a Gillette Cartridge worth $22.99, a Secret deodorant worth $7.99 and Crest toothpaste worth $3.59. Because he has at least two previous retail theft convictions, he is charged with felony retail theft. His next scheduled court date is July 21. » Comment or view comments",

Employees said the suspects were secured in the office and not causing problems. When officers arrived, they were told that the man, Kent Flowers, of Crestview, had shoplifted, the report said. A woman with him had reportedly started to shoplift, but removed all items prior to passing the registers. The theft prevention employee said she'd seen the two walk down the health and beauty aisle, taking several items, according to the report. She said they'd continued throughout the store, putting items, including steaks, in pockets and a large handbag. The woman had removed items in one of the aisles before leaving, the report said. Flowers, however, allegedly tried to leave with a Gillette Cartridge worth $22.99, a Secret deodorant worth $7.99 and Crest toothpaste worth $3.59. Because he has at least two previous retail theft convictions, he is charged with felony retail theft. His next scheduled court date is July 21.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A client who walks into Maureen and Dan Crimmins' wealth management firm won't get the hard sell to purchase a college savings plan from their office. In fact, the Crimmins say their clients won't get any sell at all. Instead, the couple, who operate a fee-only financial advisory firm in New Jersey, like to direct clients to investment vehicles they can purchase and manage on their own. College savers looking to open tax-advantaged accounts known as 529 plans have two choices: direct-sold plans, where they open the plan themselves and choose their own investment options, and advisor-sold plans, distributed through financial advisors. \"We usually really stress the self-directed 529 plans that the states offer,\" says Maureen Crimmins. \"There's so many to choose from and there are really good products out there that have low fees. You kind of set it up and leave it alone and have it grow.\" [Ask these four questions before opening a 529 plan.] Yet many investors choose to work with financial advisors. Advisor-sold plans make up about 48 percent of the market share, according to a recent report from investment research firm Morningstar. Here are some pros and cons to using an advisor. Pro: An advisor can help complete the financial picture. A financial advisor can help an investor with college savings, retirement accounts, estate planning and other goals, says Crimmins. In addition, 529 plans aren't the only option for college savings, and an advisor could direct a client to a lesser-known vehicle such as a Coverdell Education Savings Account or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act account. \"No client is the same,\" says Crimmins. \"Everyone is different. Everyone has a different financial picture that we try to get a good grasp of. There are different vehicles. There are different ways to make sure they're doing the best they can.\" [Discover three myths about college savings plans sold by brokers.] Still, that doesn't mean a college saver needs to purchase a plan from that advisor. Fee-only financial planners are required to act in the best interest of a client, and are not driven by a specific product. Con: Advisor-sold plans are more expensive. The average advisor-sold plan costs investors 1.36 percent a year, compared with 0.43 percent for direct-sold plans, according to Morningstar. Those additional fees can eat away at returns and negate any advantages that a financial advisor might bring, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, a website with information about paying for college. \"The key here is to avoid those higher fees,\" he says. \"Maybe your gross return isn't as good (with direct-sold plans), but your net return will be better. And that's what fundamentally matters.\" [Learn how to minimize four potential drawbacks of 529 plans.] He recommends investing in funds where the fees are less than 1 percent. Some advisors who earn a commission may also recommend plans that will pay them the most, not necessarily those in the college saver's best financial interest. \"You don't want your investment advisor to be steering you to the plans that benefit him as opposed to benefiting you,\" Kantrowitz says. Pro: Advisor-sold plans offer more options for investors. According to Morningstar, plans sold by advisors typically provide about double the \"static\" options, meaning portfolios that do not automatically change their mix of stocks, bonds and other assets as the beneficiary ages. The idea is that a professional advisor could customize the plan, making investment choices that take into account the investor's total portfolio, not just what's going into the 529, says Leo Acheson, analyst at Morningstar. However, investors should keep in mind that the IRS only allows them to make changes to their 529 investment holdings twice a year. Con: It's not \"rocket science.\" Over a 17- or 18-year time period for college savings, active management is not necessary, Kantrowitz says, and may not be advantageous. Being in an age-based plan – which typically starts out with a more aggressive mix of assets and becomes more conservative over time – can be more beneficial in the long run, he says. \"Most investment advisors will not beat consistently, year in and year out, broad stock market indices,\" he says. \"You may have an investment advisor beating averages for a couple years, but you're not going to do it for 17 years consistently.\" Investment advisors can be good for coordinating an entire portfolio of investments and for meeting goals, but opening a direct-sold 529 plan \"isn't rocket science,\" he says.

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found.

Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "DiffbotBody": "HOLLY Ferling will usher in a new era for women's cricket after being unveiled today as the first signing of the WBBBL Brisbane Heat team. The 19-year-old fast bowler will spearhead the Brisbane side in the inaugural Women's Big Bash League during December and January. Ferling joins fellow Kingaroy product Matthew Hayden as the first signing of the Brisbane Heat. Hayden was the face of the Heat at the KFC T20 Big Bash League in 2011. Ferling joined the other eight club's marquee players today in Sydney to officially launch the new T20 league, which will be broadcast on Network Ten's ONE station. Born and raised in Kingaroy, where she made history by taking a hat-trick as a 14-year-old in her first game of senior men's cricket, Ferling said she was honoured to be a part of the maiden WBBL side for Brisbane. \"All the girls are really excited, I think it's just going to push our profile, the team's profile, and also women's cricket that couple of steps further,\" she said. \"The BBL has become such an integral part of our summer and it will be wonderful to have the opportunity to be a part of that through our own competition.\" Ferling said the new competition would see women's cricket pushed into the public's eye. \"I think it's something we've been waiting to happen with women's cricket,\" she said. \"And then seasons to come, like we have seen with men's Big Bash, it's just going to get bigger and better every year. \"I really think the next five years, women's cricket is really going to take off.\" The WBBL Heat will be coached by current Konica Minolta Queensland Fire coach Andy Richards, who was in charge when the Fire won their maiden WT20 title in 2013-14 \"It's an exciting time for women's cricket and the game in general with the creation of the WBBL,'' Richards said. \"We've worked very hard over the years to achieve our goals and the WBBL provides all of us with added incentive to perform at our very best. \"We've seen the impact the BBL has made on families and attracting new fans, but this competition will allow girls starting out in the game to have some ready-made role models,'' he said. Brisbane Heat head coach Dan Vettori welcomed the arrival of a sister team. \"It's pretty exciting being part of something new like the WBBL and I'm sure we will all enjoy the chance to support each other along the way, especially in the double-headers that have been scheduled,'' he said. The WBBL Heat will announce further signings in the near future, with clubs to have two international players and a squad of 14 contracted players. They will play their home matches at Allan Border Field and the Gabba. The WBBL is designed to attract more women and girls to play cricket at all levels, with world class sportswomen inspiring the next generation of players, fans and volunteers. The new format, which replaces the previous state-based women's T20 competition, will see eight teams - mirroring the men's KFC Big Bash League (BBL) - compete in 59 matches over 51 days, culminating in the final on Sunday 24 January 2016.

Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. A man was found shot dead in a car on a little-used road in Clairton early Friday. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man as Derek McCellan, 44, of Clairton. Acting Clairton police Chief Robert Ferry said the victim was found in the driver's seat of a Kia rental car by a passerby who was on his way to work. The discovery was made around 6:20 a.m. near the intersection of Chambers Street and Broad Avenue. Ferry said the road is not a well-traveled one. “He was parked there,” Ferry said. “He was probably down there for a while.

Eldora was born on June 20, 1946 in Stoughton, WI to Ivan Lee and Ruby Mae (Heyen) Shantz. She was raised in Janesville, WI. At an early age, she professed her faith and made a commitment to follow Christ her entire life. After high school graduation, she earned her bachelor's degree in Missionary Nursing from St. Paul Bible College (now Crown College).

Eldora's calling to overseas ministry was fulfilled in January 1978, when they departed for the Philippines. During their 26 years there, she was involved primarily with numerous translation projects and teaching responsibilities. Following their overseas ministry, Eldora and Terry came to Baxter, MN to pastor Heartland Alliance Church. Eldora renewed her RN license, giving end of life care to her parents and returning to work as a home health care nurse. Prior to her illness, she enjoyed accompanying Terry on his over the road trucking trips. She had many other interests and activities including bird watching, cooking, reading, and in-depth studies of God's word-her lifelong passion.

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. How exactly does one follow up , the surprise-hit, male-stripper melodrama that catered to a heated audience (mainly female, slightly male) but served them a cinematic buffet concocted by skilled storyteller Steven Soderbergh? Easy. You take the show on the road. To that extent, Magic Mike XXL is the most accurate depiction of male entertainers road-tripping from Tampa to Myrtle Beach for an annual convention that Hollywood has ever produced. If you only see one movie this summer about male strippers bonding over unfulfilled dreams while they titillate female clientele, make sure it’s this one. Why? Because it’s great. Magic Mike XXL often operates as the movie Entourage desperately wanted to be – or worse, actually thinks that it is. It’s 100% bro-powered, telling the low-stakes story of impossibly handsome dudes living their irregular lives, and inviting us along for the intimate ride. But the camaraderie and mutual respect – the Zen-like “chi” that’s preached and practiced by the men of Mike -- is as organic as unforced as Entourage was artificial. As a result, Magic Mike is believable, embraceable, and worthy of celebration. Where Richard Donner’s Superman once inspired us to believe that a man can fly, Magic Mike XXL convinces us beyond a shadow of a doubt that a dancer can leave the stage behind and open an ice cream truck that has a DJ booth attached -- entertaining the masses and satisfying their sweet tooth at the same time. Picking up shortly after Magic Mike concluded, the sequel finds Mike (Channing Tatum) struggling to get his carpentry business off the ground when a phone call summons him back to Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), the freewheeling choreographer and club owner, has jumped ship, leaving beautiful but dense dancers “Big Dick” Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan, (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tito (Adam Rodriguez) rudderless. Sensing that their stripper endeavors are drawing to a close, the guys agree to venture to South Carolina for one last blowout bash at an annual dancers’ convention. Along the way, Mike convinces them to ditch the routines that Dallas burned into their individual memories (“You are not a fireman, Richie”) and embrace new routines that come from the heart. And the crotch. But mainly from the heart. Magic Mike XXL pulls off a legitimate magic trick, recognizing the expectations of its suddenly sizable fanbase and somehow exceeding them. Magic Mike XXL isn’t surprising anyone this time out. The original film cost roughly $7 million, but went on to gross a massive $167 million, fuelled by female curiosity, the magnetism of Tatum (and his co-stars), and legitimately positive word of mouth that proclaimed Soderbergh crafted a moving soap-opera in a seedy, sweat-soaked Tampa strip club – the unlikeliest of cinematic communities. Audiences came to the theater with crumpled up singles, but left Magic Mike with soggy tissues, emotionally buying in to the ongoing struggles of these three-dimensional dancers. A sequel was inevitable, and with it comes change. Soderbergh opted to stay in his self-imposed “retirement,” handing the directing duties over to longtime collaborator Gregory Jacobs (though Soderbergh did contribute to XXL as a cinematographer and editor, explaining why this follow-up has the same sweaty, late-night shimmer of the first film). And now that he has an Oscar on his shelf, McConaughey chose to hang up Dallas’ leather chaps and opt out of the fun. No bother. His mystical aura is usurped by a larger-than-life Jada Pinkett Smith, who slinks across the screen and deliberately swipes every scene as Rome, an uber-confident and confidence-boosting Savannah strip club owner who welcomes Mike back into her world of empowerment. Like Dallas, Rome resembles a character we only think exists on screen in stories like Mike XXL, and I wondered numerous times during her unique scenes if this person, and her establishment, actually exist. Moving forward, however, I don’t need more Rome. Quite the contrary. I’d be thrilled if each Magic Mike sequel found a new character actor willing to fill the “role” of outsized Mike mentor, the way McConaughey and Pinkett Smith already have. Wait, subsequent Magic Mike movies? You better believe it. Magic Mike XXL is a different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining… by design. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and surprisingly unpredictable. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. XXL sheds the heaviest baggage of Soderbergh’s initial foray, keeping just enough drama to ensure tension, then filling in the gaps with unfiltered bro-heavy chemistry. It’s a winning formula, and one that proves that Mike’s world is one worth revisiting, just to spend time with these friends. We spend a lot of time talking about developing Cinematic Universes for characters who don tights and capes. What about the guys who slip out of their super suits to entertain? Don’t they deserve their own multi-film series? If and when Magic Mike XXL matches the box-office bar set by the original, it’s time we start having that conversation.",

It was Copeland’s New York debut in the lead role, a key moment for her fans who hope she’ll soon be named American Ballet Theater’s first black principal dancer. (Gene Schiavone/American Ballet Theater via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Ballerina Misty Copeland, who just became the first African-American woman to be a principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre, has another breakthrough planned — a debut on Broadway. Producers of the high-energy revival of “On the Town” said Sunday that Copeland will join the show from Aug. 25 to Sept. 6, playing Miss Turnstiles, a love interest for one of three sailors enjoying a few hours of shore leave in 1940s New York. “I don’t know if I know what I’m in for. It’s going to be a huge challenge for me. It’s quite a departure from what I’m used to. But I love a challenge and I think it’s going to help me grow as an artist,” Copeland said. The role requires both acting and singing, in addition to plenty of dancing, including a 15-minute ballet at the end. The role is currently filled by Megan Fairchild, a principal dancer at the prestigious New York City Ballet. “I can carry a tune. We’ll see what happens,” she said. “I’m excited. I’m a Virgo and we’re a little bit anal and we’re definitely hard workers, so I’m going to put my all into this.” Copeland saw the show a few months ago with her boyfriend, knowing the offer of replacing Fairchild was on the table. “It’s probably the best show I’ve ever seen, I think,” she said. “I was just blown away.” The ballerina will play six performances during the eight-show week, including the Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evening shows, as well as the matinees on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. Copeland has been named by Time magazine one of the most influential figures of 2015, and written both a children’s book, “Firebird,” and a best-selling memoir, “Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina.” She’s also performed in a music video with Prince and was featured in a hugely popular online ad for Under Armour sportswear. The dancer also has appeared as a guest host on the Fox show “So You Think You Can Dance” and was a presenter at this year’s Tony Awards. Copeland, 32, said she relishes bringing dance to an audience in any form she can. “Whether it’s Broadway or ballet, that’s always been my goal: to just bring more people into it,” she said. “Because I think it’s so special and I think the arts can do so much for a person, not just a child.

    "DiffbotBody": "Southwest Airlines' controversial CEO Gary Kelly appears to have opened a huge hornets' nest in the wake of news about a tentative agreement on a new contract with more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants who work at the low-fare behemoth. With Southwest's largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, Chicago also is the domicile for the largest number of Southwest flight attendants, more than 1,800 altogether, according to a spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents Southwest flight attendants. Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Another flight attendant with more than a decade of work at Southwest offered a similar sentiment in an email: \"The (Local 556) union does appear to be too cozy with management.\" Though so-called \"educators\" have been used by Local 556 in the past to help members sort through and understand details of proposed contracts, some flight attendants questioned that procedure this time around, suggesting it could be another means of influencing— or pressuring — union members to vote in favor of a new contract. Noted one Southwest flight attendant: \"Our union handpicked 100 people to fly into Dallas for 'tentative agreement' training with our union dollars for two days so they could 'educate' the rest of us on the tentative agreement.\" Some flight attendants also wondered why Southwest management was suddenly able to come to tentative terms with flight attendants, while other major unions, including those representing pilots, ramp agents and mechanics, have been unable to get even a tentative deal. Ramp agents, in particular, have been in talks for some four years. Flight attendant contract negotiations had been ongoing for two years. The rank and file members of Local 556 will be able to get their first look at the full contract starting tomorrow. Then they will have 16 days to obtain the proposed contract, read it, digest it and then vote — a shorter time frame than the 30-day window for previous contracts, according to some flight attendants who wonder why this is all suddenly so rushed. A Local 556 spokesman said the contract would be ratified if a majority of those who actually vote cast a vote in favor of ratification. As for the vocal backlash among some rank and file union members to news of the tentative contract, a Local 556 spokesman noted: \"We are a large group and not everyone is going to see things the same way.\" By the end of July, however, it should be clear whether enough flight attendants see the proposed contract the same way Southwest Airlines management and Local 556's executive board apparently do.",

She’s lost her connection to the songs of her kinfolk and gained a spectral “haint” that warns of tragedy to come. This is a totally unique contemporary fantasy — a love song to Appalachian music and folklore, richly layered, sexy, with a touch of the supernatural dancing just under the mandolin strings. “Bel Canto” by Ann Patchett. A world-class operatic diva, a Japanese millionaire, a youthful translator and a rebel soldier are thrown together in a South American villa when a coup attempt becomes a protracted hostage crisis. Dreamlike, hilarious and heartbreaking, this novel explores the power of music to unite us across languages and battle lines. Patchett modeled the heroine on soprano Renee Fleming. Read along with an album of her singing to complete the experience. Copyright ©2015 Omaha World-Herald. All rights reserved.

I was on my way to my dream trip to Europe for a Viking River Cruise and had just passed through security. I started taking inventory of all my belongings and realized that I had left my cell phone at my office. That’s when Officer Carrigan came to the rescue. She called her supervisor, Sgt. Bellows. They then arranged for Sgt. Bellows to pick up my phone at my office and deliver it to me at the airport. Thanks to their help, my trip began on the right foot and my anxiety disappeared. Too often our law enforcement officers are defamed in the news and seldom singled out for the times when they lend valuable assistance. I felt it important to note the much-appreciated help I was given. Thank you. Glenn Seibel Bemidji",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office reported the following incidents: INFORMATION: On June 29, Deputy John Perry met with a man who said he bought a car that had falsely advertised mileage. The victim told police he purchased the car in April and both the bill of sale and title stated the car had 64,000 miles. The man then ran a CARFAX report in June which showed the vehicle had 280,296 miles as of October 2014. When the deputy read the car’s title, it was found the previous owner knew the odometer did not reflect the car’s actual mileage. PHONE SCAM: On June 29, Deputy Tim Nix met with a man who said he was victim of an attempted IRS phone scam. The victim told police the caller told him he owed the federal government $4,900 and asked many personal questions such as how he would pay the bill and how much money was in his bank account. The suspect then told him his accounts would be locked down and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department will arrest him if he did not pay. STOLEN ITEM RECOVERED: On June 29, Deputy Philip Wilshire was dispatched to Old Pendergrass Road where a man said his car’s registration tag had been stolen and replaced with another. The victim told police he had just put on a new registration sticker earlier in the day, but later noticed it had been removed and replaced with a different one that did not belong to him. When police ran the tag, it was found to be a stolen tag. INFORMATION: On June 30, Deputy Tommy Haynes was dispatched to Park Street in Pendergrass where someone found a bloody shirt and a broken wood chipper with blood nearby. The deputy was unable to find a wood chipper, but did find a rusted blade which could be used in a box cutter. The complainant said the items could be related to Josh Adams who has been missing for three years and also asked about a possible reward. STOLEN GAS: On July 1, Deputy Brandon Baker was dispatched to Old Commerce Extension where a man said two people stole gas from his truck. The victim told police he was sleeping when he heard voices outside and noticed two people walking through his yard. He attempted to chase the two, but he fell and they got away. The victim said a quarter of a tank of gas was taken from his truck, which was the second time someone had stolen either items or gas from him.

Advertisement With a lot of walleye anglers from the area going to Leech Lake, that kind of shows how the bite has been around Brainerd. Which brings me back to my quest to find out what's up with Gull Lake. I hear the tourism in the area is above average, which we can tell by how busy town is. But after days of fishing and no fish, are they coming back? Then I hear fish numbers are average for Gull Lake. Then another thought I have been hearing is that stocked fish stay in the weeds because they grow up in weeds and it is familiar to them. But Gull is mainly stocked with fry, which do not grow up in weeds. Myself and most other anglers remember when you could always go out and catch a few fish during the day, but now those days are few and far between. You can still catch fish during the primetime hours and after dark. So I guess its time to get the headlamp on and go fishin'.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Twins have shown interest in free agent righthander and former closer Neftali Feliz, according to a source with knowledge of their interest. Feliz, just 27, posted a 4.58 ERA in 18 games with the Rangers before being designated for assignment July 3. He cleared waivers but, as a player with at least five seasons of service time, rejected an outright assignment to the minors to become a free agent. Feliz broke into the majors throwing fastballs of 100 miles-per-hour. He was the Rangers closer for their World Series years of 2010 and 2011 and was an All-Star in 2010. He doesn't reach 100 anymore but his fastball averaged 93.8 mph this season, according to fangraphs.com. He had Tommy John surgery in 2012 and returned late in 2013. The Twins are looking for bullpen help, and Feliz could help them in the sixth and seventh innings. They will likely take a look at Feliz's medicals before proceeding, A handful of other clubs also have expressed interest in Feliz. After the game, there were rumblings that Feliz was going to land with the Tigers. There have been no other reports on this, so we will see. Now for some quick thoughts following a wild night at Target. I was stunned to see Eddie Rosario steal second in the ninth. He was initially called out but replays showed he was safe. The Twins dodged a bullet. Twins manager Paul Molitor took some of blame for how he communicated to Rosario. Rosario was not behind held at first, so he had the option of getting a walking lead and taking off for second if Soria picked up his leg. Soria did, but Rosario didn't get as big of a lead as he should have, making the play much closer than it should have been. Ervin Santana gave up a solo home run, a two-run homer and a three-run shot over four innings in his Target Field debut. \"You make a mistake against that team, they've got a lot of power,'' he said. Santana just wasn't sharp. His home run balls caught too much of the plate and his slider lacked bite. The Twins comeback doesn't happen with J.R. Graham pitching three scoreless innings in relief of Santana. He was followed by Ryan O'Rourke, who pitched a scoreless eighth. Trevor May pitched the ninth and got the win. \"They don't seem so significant at the time,'' Molitor said. La Velle E. Neal III has covered baseball for the Star Tribune since 1998 (the post-Knoblauch era). Born and raised in Chicago, he grew up following the White Sox and hating the Cubs. He attended both the University of Illinois and Illinois-Chicago and began his baseball writing career at the Kansas City Star. He can be heard occasionally on KFAN radio, lending his great baseball mind to Paul Allen and other hosts. Mark Rosen borrows him occasionally for WCCO-TV. Phil Miller covered three seasons of Twins baseball, but that was at a different ballpark for a different newspaper. Now Miller returns to the baseball beat after joining the Star Tribune as the Gopher football writer in 2010, and he won't miss the dingy dome for a minute.

    "DiffbotBody": "Love fancy food. Love good friends. Love that my dessert was called a pecan half ball. A photo posted by @bethanyhileman on May 13, 2015 at 5:59pm PDT Cheevers is a little bit of a hidden gem found just off 23rd Street — an area in which you can buy gourmet cupcakes, start your next tattoo, and get a loan all on one block. Some people call it cozy, some call it cramped, but your day has nowhere to go but down after devouring the huge portions of chicken fried steak and their famed carrot cake. Before you leave, don’t forget to stuff the rest of the dinner rolls covered in sea salt butter and heaven in your purse for later. 2. The Mule A Plaza District bar/restaurant combo, The Mule is perfect place to meet your family for dinner and then — hours later when you’re STILL there — go home with a hipster stranger who inevitably lives just a short fixed-gear bike ride away. While the drinks are perfectly delicious and there’s an overwhelming beer selection, it’s the gourmet sandwiches that keep us coming back night after drunken night. Nothing feels more Oklahoman than cramming jalapeño cornbread, BBQ pulled pork, and macaroni and cheese into your mouth all at the same time. 3. Big Truck Tacos There’s basically no way anyone who lives in OKC hasn’t eaten at BTT. It’s conceivable that some haven’t been to the actual establishment, but with the most active food truck in the city, everyone has had it at some point. Offering fast but not fast-food Mexican to the OKC masses, BTT’s motto is “Saving the world, one taco at a time.” Their mission a noble one, we show our support by consuming large quantities of beer can chicken tacos and Mexican Coke. 4. Edna’s Located in the freaking Bermuda Triangle that is Classen Circle, Edna’s is home to the legendary Lunchbox: a mix of OJ, light beer, and amaretto. Much like your first kiss, you never forget your first Lunchbox. TRC is a quirky coffee shop located in the Asian District that would be hard to find except there’s a giant red cup on the roof to let you know you’re probably on the right track. The interior is eclectic to say the least, with no two pieces of furniture, artwork, or even cups alike. Although the food menu features a divisive strictly vegetarian offering, even the most carnivorous OKC locals can agree that TRC has the best mocha milkshakes on the planet. For those 3 to 4 OKC snow days a year, the Sexi Mexi (a spicy mix of espresso, steamed milk, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and chocolate) keeps the harsh criticism of OKC drivers’ ability to drive in said snow to a minimum. Great job today by the Lady Pioneers! 3rd Place finish by the team!!! Mackenzie, Emily, and Sam all finished in the top 15! #golf #golfteam #stillwater #oklahomagolf #conference #greatteam #golfgirls A photo posted by Amy Daniel (@a_daniel1) on Apr 14, 2015 at 5:38pm PDT Speaking of spicy, Ted’s is the absolute best place to get TexMex — a unique, cheese-covered quasi-Mexican cuisine that leaves actual Mexicans shaking their heads in disgust. The long wait at Ted’s is an agony-filled blur of mariachi music and parties of 10-plus, but nothing is sweeter than finally sitting down to an endless parade of chips, queso, salsa, and handmade tortillas. For those of us still in mourning over the loss of Mad Men — or the days of misogyny and lava rock — R\u0026J’s fills the hole in our old souls. A retro-style cocktail lounge, R\u0026J’s is all about misplaced nostalgia with its low lighting, red velvet wallpaper, and dark leather seats. While most of its clientele wasn’t alive during the time of “Happy Hour” Don Draper-style, we can all pretend we were while sipping our Old Fashions to the indie songs of yesteryear (meaning 2013). A photo posted by Taylor Migliazzo (@mignugget3) on Jul 6, 2015 at 9:37am PDT Centered around a large teepee (and no we don’t all live in teepees in Oklahoma) the Bleu Garten is the best place to enjoy the OKC summer nights. Just make sure to wait until the sun has gone down and the air has returned to a temperature that actually sustains life. The place has two badass bars, a constantly rotating group of gourmet food trucks, flatscreen TVs, and a host of games that are surprisingly fun as an adult — like oversized Jenga. Bleu Garten is relaxed enough to welcome all kinds, including dogs, which makes it the best spot for people watching this side of the Belle Aisle Walmart. 9. Café 501 Although the Classen Curve is normally populated by Edmond moms buying their $150 yoga sweaters or duvet covers that cost more than the average OKC monthly rent, Café 501 is a rare lunch spot worth potentially door-dinging a Maserati. The Coyote Crunch wrap is the best nod in the city to OKC’s sometimes inclusion into Southwest culture. 10. Sushi Neko Sushi Neko is OKC’s most famous sushi place.

Fun dinner with @ryjo75, @kbrownokc \u0026 @floralvision A photo posted by thefleuriste (@thefleuriste) on Feb 17, 2014 at 7:12pm PST It used to be that when we wanted to party like an Oklahoma oil baron, OKC residents would go to the 70s/80s oil exec hot spot Junior’s. However, for those of us that don’t subscribe to the “Drill, Baby, Drill” mindset, Michael’s Grill is slowly taking its place as the rightful owner of the title of best steak in OKC. There are several comparisons to Junior’s, like the Caesar salads (made tableside) and the refreshing after-dinner brandy ice, but the much more modern feel of Michael’s make it OKC’s best date night restaurant. Or possibly just special occasions, because no one escapes Michael’s without paying well over the average price per barrel of that precious black gold. But when the awesome staff, including the always present owner Michael himself, is tending to your every need as if you’re Aubrey McClendon himself, we willingly part with our real gold at the end of the night. A photo posted by Feral Meets World (@feralmeetsworld) on Jul 8, 2015 at 8:45pm PDT If you’re drunk and hungry — or you want to be — follow the Pink Elephant to one of the best pizza parlors/local beer selection in OKC. Get your bacon on with the Notorious P.I.G., or support the greatest basketball player of all time with the Brussel Westbrook. Every Thursday evening, OKC residents dress up a little nicer, head downtown, and pretend that we will take advantage of the $5 dollar admission to OKC’s fantastic art museum during Art After 5. In reality, we all take the elevator straight up to the top floor and enjoy a boozy Happy Hour with a view of downtown and free chips and salsa. We’ll go see the Chihulys next week, we promise. 15. Braums A photo posted by Hailey King (@haileylyn) on Jul 29, 2012 at 8:28pm PDT This might technically qualify as a fast-food chain, but don’t mention that to any of us. Nothing is bad at Braums. Nothing. Not the hamburgers, the crinkle fries, the ice cream, not even the cringe-inducing advertisements seemingly shot around the same time TV became a thing. Don’t ever change, Braums.",
    "LabBody": "1. Cheevers is a little bit of a hidden gem found just off 23rd Street — an area in which you can buy gourmet cupcakes, start your next tattoo, and get a loan all on one block. Some people call it cozy, some call it cramped, but your day has nowhere to go but down after devouring the huge portions of chicken fried steak and their famed carrot cake. Before you leave, don’t forget to stuff the rest of the dinner rolls covered in sea salt butter and heaven in your purse for later. 2. A Plaza District bar/restaurant combo, The Mule is perfect place to meet your family for dinner and then — hours later when you’re STILL there — go home with a hipster stranger who inevitably lives just a short fixed-gear bike ride away. While the drinks are perfectly delicious and there’s an overwhelming beer selection, it’s the gourmet sandwiches that keep us coming back night after drunken night. Nothing feels more Oklahoman than cramming jalapeño cornbread, BBQ pulled pork, and macaroni and cheese into your mouth all at the same time. 3. There’s basically no way anyone who lives in OKC hasn’t eaten at BTT. It’s conceivable that some haven’t been to the actual establishment, but with the most active food truck in the city, everyone has had it at some point. Offering fast but not fast-food Mexican to the OKC masses, BTT’s motto is “Saving the world, one taco at a time.” Their mission a noble one, we show our support by consuming large quantities of beer can chicken tacos and Mexican Coke. 4. Located in the freaking Bermuda Triangle that is Classen Circle, Edna’s is home to the legendary Lunchbox: a mix of OJ, light beer, and amaretto. Much like your first kiss, you never forget your first Lunchbox. 5. TRC is a quirky coffee shop located in the Asian District that would be hard to find except there’s a giant red cup on the roof to let you know you’re probably on the right track. The interior is eclectic to say the least, with no two pieces of furniture, artwork, or even cups alike. Although the food menu features a divisive strictly vegetarian offering, even the most carnivorous OKC locals can agree that TRC has the best mocha milkshakes on the planet. For those 3 to 4 OKC snow days a year, the Sexi Mexi (a spicy mix of espresso, steamed milk, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and chocolate) keeps the harsh criticism of OKC drivers’ ability to drive in said snow to a minimum. 6. Speaking of spicy, Ted’s is the absolute best place to get TexMex — a unique, cheese-covered quasi-Mexican cuisine that leaves actual Mexicans shaking their heads in disgust. The long wait at Ted’s is an agony-filled blur of mariachi music and parties of 10-plus, but nothing is sweeter than finally sitting down to an endless parade of chips, queso, salsa, and handmade tortillas. 7. For those of us still in mourning over the loss of Mad Men — or the days of misogyny and lava rock — R\u0026J’s fills the hole in our old souls. A retro-style cocktail lounge, R\u0026J’s is all about misplaced nostalgia with its low lighting, red velvet wallpaper, and dark leather seats. While most of its clientele wasn’t alive during the time of “Happy Hour” Don Draper-style, we can all pretend we were while sipping our Old Fashions to the indie songs of yesteryear (meaning 2013). 8. Centered around a large teepee (and no we don’t all live in teepees in Oklahoma) the Bleu Garten is the best place to enjoy the OKC summer nights. Just make sure to wait until the sun has gone down and the air has returned to a temperature that actually sustains life. The place has two badass bars, a constantly rotating group of gourmet food trucks, flatscreen TVs, and a host of games that are surprisingly fun as an adult — like oversized Jenga. Bleu Garten is relaxed enough to welcome all kinds, including dogs, which makes it the best spot for people watching this side of the Belle Aisle Walmart. 9. Although the Classen Curve is normally populated by Edmond moms buying their $150 yoga sweaters or duvet covers that cost more than the average OKC monthly rent, Café 501 is a rare lunch spot worth potentially door-dinging a Maserati. The Coyote Crunch wrap is the best nod in the city to OKC’s sometimes inclusion into Southwest culture. 10. Sushi Neko is OKC’s most famous sushi place. This in itself is a pretty amazing feat, given that our state’s most notable relationship with fish involves sticking limbs into murky water in the hopes of catching a live one. Although not the most authentic of sashimi joints, most of us locals had our first non-Target sushi experience at Neko. It’s got all our normal favorite rolls like the Cowboy and Oklahoma Dynamite, but it’s the Red Canyon Roll — so messy it’s served in a shallow bowl — that keeps us battling the bitch that is parking on Western Avenue. 11.

Officers performed a traffic stop and spoke to the woman, noticing a \"strong odor\" of alcohol on her breath, the report said. When asked how much she'd had to drink, she said two beers, maybe more. When asked if she thought the drinks had anything to do with the way she was driving, she answered \"yes,\" according to the report. She was unable to walk without using the vehicle for support and swayed while leaning against the vehicle. She refused to perform field sobriety tests or breath tests, the report said.

    "DiffbotBody": "In the wildly blunt back-and-forth between Cigna and Anthem over their would-be $47 billion merger, the clash of CEOs drew headlines, but the heart of the issue is efficiency in the health system — as it is with the reportedly imminent deal between Aetna and Humana. It's an old story with a new Obamacare twist. But the key question remains the same. Who will benefit from all this supposed exorcism of waste? Spoiler alert: It isn't you and me, at least not as health care consumers. The logic works like this: Obamacare is prodding the nation's five already giant health insurers into megamergers by promising to reward patient management of large populations as we move away from the old fee-for-service model that rewards more medical care rather than preventive health. It might seem as though 14 million customers, representing more than 20 million covered people, makes Cigna, for example, plenty big to take advantage of this new way of thinking. But, the argument goes, with 360 metro markets in the United States, and several types of public and private medical coverage in play, a company must now be bigger than big. Federal regulators, seeing this, will summarily approve the megamergers in the latest round, or so the logic goes. After all, it's federal action — punctuated by Thursday's Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare subsidies in every state — that is creating the merger pressure to begin with. There might be some logic to all that. Big companies have always said they need to scale up in order to deliver benefits of efficiency. But even if this wave of mergers is good for the companies involved — a hotly debated question — the main winners are likely to be shareholders, top managers and Wall Street advisers in the health management cartel, not health care consumers. So, will merging the largest health insurers — or management companies, as they now call themselves — from five down to three, or even two, succeed in removing cost and waste in the system? That's hard to know, because big bureaucracies always have their own weight to carry. Anthem is promising an additional $900 million or more in annual profits, which implies a huge expense haircut. But let's say the claims are on target and the mergers make the combined companies more efficient. Will prices for consumers fall, and will health outcomes improve as a result? History has a clear answer to that question. \"Research has not been too friendly to these mergers,\" said Leemore Dafny, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, who has studied the effects of mergers in the health sector. \"If past is prologue and if you look at the averages, premiums go up.\" The problem is that the merger talks pit insurer against insurer dividing up the benefits, with hospitals, medical professionals and customers not represented. The only hope for consumers is that the Department of Justice and other regulators will do the right thing, just as the Federal Communications Commission did the right thing in showing Comcast and Time Warner Cable the door earlier this year when they sang the same song about efficiency and scale. Doing the right thing does not necessarily mean regulators must reject these mergers outright. And it doesn't only mean they must order divestitures of a few business units that would make the combined companies anti-competitive. Dafny and others have a better way to approach mergers. Simply put, the combining companies should be required to show in advance how the mergers would create broad social benefits, and how those benefits would be measured. Why not impose this added burden? For all you libertarians out there who believe this would mark a dangerous incursion by government, remember: More than half of health care is paid by taxpayers. If a couple of insurers want to marry up with less oversight, fine. They just wouldn't get any Medicare, Tricare or Medicaid work. In a May 28 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dafny and co-author Thomas Lee, a physician and health care executive, acknowledge that there's no easy way to calculate these broader benefits, known in the antitrust world as cognizable efficiencies, in advance. \"However, the absence of detail on these items should arouse concern about whether the goal of a given merger is truly to better serve the community,\" they wrote. The companies certainly go into detail about measurable benefits for shareholders, and buried in their bylaws are the tens of millions that their CEOs would gain in a \"change in control.\" The article by Dafny and Lee was about mergers among hospitals and other health care providers, but Dafny said the same principles can apply to mergers of insurers. In a way, more is at stake because there are far fewer insurers left. The beauty of imposing higher regulatory barriers on health insurance mergers is that these companies don't need any immediate help from each other. They're doing fine, thank you, as a result of Obamacare's universal health insurance mandate, internal cost-cutting and more aggressive management of patient care — not just denial of services like in the bad old 1990s, but also some pretty good preventive health programs. Cigna said earlier this year that it expects to double its revenues over the next six or seven years, on its own, without a merger. Its expenses are dropping in large part as a result of health management of the people it insures. Evidence of this is the fact that, under federal rules, it's giving money back to customers because it spent too little on medical care. Cigna, under CEO David Cordani, saw its share price increase by 238 percent — multiplying its value by more than three times — from a low on July 26, 2012, until one month ago, when merger rumors surfaced. This year's projected revenues are up 31 percent from 2012, and operating income is up 41 percent in that time. Aetna under Mark Bertolini saw a similar stock gain since its recent low on that same day, July 26, 2012. Its three-year revenue gain was even larger, 68 percent, with the acquisition of Coventry Health Care in 2013, and Aetna posted a slightly smaller profit gain. For Cigna, the $184-per-share offer from Anthem represents more than a fourfold increase since mid-2012. Notably, the companies seeking to make acquisitions are also seeing their stock prices rise, which doesn't typically happen. Wall Street believes the larger, combined companies would post better numbers together than apart. But history shows they'd do so on the backs of thousands of sacked employees — many of them in Connecticut — whether they are the acquirer or the company being acquired. And they'd squeeze health care providers as well as customers as they concentrated market power. It's exceedingly hard to prove a link between mergers and higher prices because there are so many factors causing private insurance premiums prices to rise. But in a 2012 study published in the American Economic Review, Dafny and two co-authors showed that across all U.S. markets, the 1999 merger of Aetna and Prudential HealthCare raised premiums by an average of 7 percent by 2006. They used that merger in their study because it was national, with significant overlap in a majority of the 139 health care markets, and prices before and after the merger were avialable. \"Our findings indicate that Americans are indeed paying a premium on their health insurance premiums as a result of recent increases in market concentration of the health insurance industry,\" the study said. \"However, consolidation explains only a fraction of the steep increase in premiums in recent years.\" Smaller-scale studies have shown similar results. Executives, of course, talk about benefits to consumers, which is theoretically true — if larger insurers have more power to push doctors' and hospitals' prices down, and if their broad population-health measures work well. But there are other ways to achieve benefits to consumers, if that's what the companies really want. Dafny, who had a stint as an economist at the Federal Trade Commission overseeing antitrust in health care, suggests the companies can \"invest more time in designing creative products for consumers, and in helping providers to deliver value rather than volume,\" before they seek mergers. \"There's a lot that insurers could do to try to create value,\" Dafny said. \"Have they given it a try?\"",

File) Ken ‘Snake’ Stabler, who led the Oakland Raiders to a Super Bowl victory and was the NFL’s Most Valuable Player in 1974, has died as a result of complications from colon cancer. He was 69. His family announced his death on Stabler’s Facebook page on Thursday. The statement said Stabler “passed peacefully” on Wednesday while surrounded by family, including his three daughters and longtime partner, who wasn’t named. Raiders owner Mark Davis said the team was “deeply saddened by the passing of the great Ken Stabler.” “He was a cherished member of the Raider family and personified what it means to be a Raider,” Davis said in a statement. “He wore the Silver and Black with Pride and Poise and will continue to live in the hearts of Raider fans everywhere. Our sincerest thoughts and prayers go out to Kenny’s family.” Stabler’s coach with the Raiders, John Madden, said his former quarterback was cool under pressure. “I’ve often said, if I had one drive to win a game to this day, and I had a quarterback to pick, I would pick Kenny,” Madden said. “Snake was a lot cooler than I was. He was a perfect quarterback and a perfect Raider. When you think about the Raiders you think about Ken Stabler. Kenny loved life. It is a sad day for all Raiders.” Stabler was a four-time Pro Bowl selection with the Raiders, leading the franchise to consistent success during the 1970s, including a 32-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the 1977 Super Bowl. The family’s statement said he was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer in February. Stabler’s favorite songs were playing, from Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” to Van Morrison’s “Leaves Falling Down,” the family said. His brain and spinal cord were donated to Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center to support research into degenerative brain disease among athletes, according to the family. “He was a kind, generous and unselfish man, never turning down an autograph request or an opportunity to help someone in need,” the family said. “A great quarterback, he was an even greater father to his three girls, and grandfather to his two ‘grand snakes.'” The Foley, Alabama, native threw for 27,938 career yards over 15 seasons, which also included stints with the Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints During his college career, Stabler led Alabama to an undefeated 1966 season and was chosen the Sugar Bowl MVP after a 34-7 rout of Nebraska. He also ran for a long touchdown on a rain-soaked field during the 1967 Iron Bowl to lead the Tide to a 7-3 win over Auburn. Alabama coach Nick Saban got to know Stabler from golf tournaments and the ex-Raiders quarterback’s stint as an analyst on Alabama radio broadcasts. “I think anyone who had the chance to get to know Kenny would appreciate the great person he was and the pride he had for the University of Alabama,” Saban said in a statement. “I have had the chance to be around some of the best to ever play college and pro football, and Kenny may have been one of the greatest competitors to ever play the game.” ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL 521 total views, 8 views today",

    "DiffbotBody": "You know the big problem with gigantic lunar craters, right? They’re absolutely freezing! This not only makes them an inhospitable habitat for humans, but even robots designed specifically for a space environment can experience operational and maintenance problems if exposed to the shadowy cold of the Moon for too long. But what if you could reflect sunlight directly into the heart of a lunar crater to generate a warm, well-lit environment that’s better suited to the needs of robots and their kindly human overlords? That’s the thinking behind NASA’s audacious ‘Trans-Formers for Lunar Extreme Environments’ project - one of several new research projects the US space agency greenlit this week. The project involves navigating a rover unit to the rim of a crater, where it will erect a ‘TransFormer’ mirror array to reflect sunlight into the darkened cavity below, with the goal of generating enough warmth and light in the area for experiments to be performed remotely by other robots down at the base. According to Adrian Stoica of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “The TransFormer (TF) concept is a paradigm shift to operating in Extreme Environments (EE). TFs are systems that direct energy into energy-depleted (extreme) environments, transforming them, locally, around robots or humans, into mild micro-environments.” The effect could be amplified by several TransFormer units working in unison, catching different angles of sunlight to provide “continuous collective illumination”, he said. The TransFormer plan is one of seven projects in NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. The goal of the initiative, which awards as much as US$500,000 in funding over the course of a two-year research grant, is to nurture “visionary ideas that could transform future NASA missions with the creation of breakthroughs - radically better or entirely new aerospace concepts - while engaging America’s innovators and entrepreneurs as partners in the journey”. In other words, it’s NASA’s version of the Google ‘Moonshot’ philosophy. Except literally, in some cases, and performed by the very people who invented Moonshots in the first place. The other concepts that have made it through to Phase II of the NIAC program are no less adventurous. They include the Titan Submarine, designed to explore icy oceans on cold planets; Swarm Flyby Gravimetry, which pilots a fleet of small drones around asteroids and comets in order to map their gravitational fields; and the Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (HERTS), a solar sail designed for speedy return trips to outer planets in our Solar System within one to two years of launch. “This is an excellent group of NIAC studies,” said NASA’s Jason Derleth in a statement. “From seeing into cave formations on the Moon to a radically new kind of solar sail that uses solar wind instead of light, NIAC continues to push the bounds of current technology.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Former All-Star point guard Deron Williams has agreed to join his hometown Dallas Mavericks upon clearing waivers, sources told ESPN's Marc Stein. Sources say Williams will sign a two-year contract worth about $10 million with the Mavs. The negotiations come in advance of Williams clearing waivers after he swiftly secured a buyout with the Brooklyn Nets, sources said. Williams would clear waivers 48 hours after his release by the Nets, which was officially announced Saturday. NBA.com first reported Williams' buyout Friday. Earlier Friday, ESPN.com reported that Williams was pressing the Nets to release him so he could sign with the Mavericks, who famously lost a free-agent faceoff for the point guard's services in the summer of 2012. Editor's Picks The weight of his hometown team won't be on Williams' shoulders when he officially joins the Mavs, as it would have been a few years ago. The Deron Williams era is over. The Nets are paying him $27.5 million to go away but the move saves them on luxury taxes and salary cap room. Nets find tax relief in buying out Deron Williams, and Dallas gets a former All-Star point guard. Sources say the Nets will buy out the remaining $43 million on Williams' contract for $27.5 million, with payments to him spread over the next five seasons. The money Williams earns from the Mavericks would be on top of what Brooklyn owes him as part of the divorce. It's unlikely another team will claim Williams because he has underperformed since signing a max contract to stay with the Nets in 2012. Sources familiar with the Nets' thinking told Stein that Brooklyn is now intent on keeping Joe Johnson. The Nets had been shopping him because Johnson's contract was deemed more tradeable than Williams' deal, but manufacturing an exit for Williams, as one source described it, was always \"the preferred route.\" The Williams buyout is poised to solve the bulk of Brooklyn's luxury tax issues, so it behooves the Nets competitively to keep Johnson next season, since they have already traded away their 2016 first-round pick and can't improve their lottery chances by going into a rebuild mode. Brooklyn's attempts to trade Williams went nowhere, with a limited trade market seemingly getting thinner. The Sacramento Kings pondered trading for Williams last season, but it's believed the Kings were no longer interested after striking a one-year, $9.5 million deal in free agency with Rajon Rondo. The Mavericks, sources said, did not pursue a trade for Williams because of the salary-cap space such a move would eat up. The Mavs famously lost out to the Nets in a heated recruiting battle for the Dallas-area native in the summer of 2012, but Williams' stock as a Net declined considerably since he agreed to that five-year, $99 million deal to stay with Brooklyn. Dallas has a significant hole at point guard after its failed Rondo experiment, while sources say Williams is eager for a fresh start after four long seasons. Dallas emerged as his preferred destination, sources said, in part because he could reunite with new Mavs guard Wesley Matthews, his former Jazz teammate. Williams' wife, Amy, tweeted a thank-you to Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Friday night. Williams averaged 13.0 points and 6.6 assists per game last season while shooting a career-worst 38.7 percent from the field. ESPN's Mike Mazzeo and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Who doesn’t love the idea of viewing and interacting with 3D holograms brought to life right in front of your eyes? The applications for entertainment and gaming are off the charts, but the implications for augmented reality in education and science are also undoubtedly massive. And now, Microsoft has teamed up with Case Western University in the US to show us what this might look like in an actual human anatomy class video demonstration. Human anatomy has been taught via two-dimensional representations of body parts for centuries, and even though in more recent times computer software has introduced various kinds of pseudo–3D anatomical models on 2D displays, none of these can rival the interactive holograms that HoloLens is capable of projecting (to the viewer’s eyes, at least). “With HoloLens, you can see the muscles on top of the skeleton, all at the same time. You can bring them in and out, and exactly understand where things sit,” says Mark Griswold, from the university’s radiology department. “You can take any anatomical part and show any of it,” adds Satyam Ghodasara, a medical student studying at the university. “You can move it around, you can make it kind of translucent so you can see through the outside, and that really helped me understand how cardiac anatomy worked.” The holograms will also enable anatomy and medicine students to learn things they wouldn’t be able to learn from studying living people. Bodily organs can be viewed and interacted with in isolation from other parts of the body, helping students to learn how they look and function. And importantly, if something goes wrong in a medical simulation, nobody gets hurt. Not that HoloLens only has eyes on the sciences. The video suggests that subjects like anthropology and art history could stand to benefit from HoloLens-based lessons, but really, any academic course featuring strong visual concepts may be suitable. Microsoft has been careful to show this time that holograms only appear in a limited portion of the wearer’s vision, addressing a minor controversy over the field of view the HoloLens visor offers to the user. In previous videos, the company seemed to imply that the 3D hologram depictions would fill the wearer’s whole field of vision, which caused a few ripples when some early testers pointed out that the effect was confined to a virtual window in front of them.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Published: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 12:01 a.m. Last Modified: Thursday, July 9, 2015 at 10:04 p.m. I am writing to express my concern about a recent decision made by Polk County Public Schools to eliminate eight school psychologist positions for the coming school year. As a retired supervisor of school psychologists in our district, I am very much aware of the critical services they deliver. School psychologists provide students with individual and group counseling, data collection and progress monitoring, crisis intervention services, assessment for special education programs (ESE), consultation with teachers to develop educational interventions and behavior/ learning program development. When assessing students for ESE, there are state and federal mandates that require evaluations for special education be completed within a 60-day timeline. That timeline has recently been decreased from counting school days to calculating calendar days, which now includes days students are not in attendance. It is estimated across the state that this recent change will cause many districts to be out of compliance given current staffing levels, which could ultimately result in the loss of funding for ESE programs. Eliminating school psychologist positions is ill advised for this and for many other reasons. Polk County has a poverty rate of 39 percent as compared to the Florida rate of 19 percent. It is well documented that children of poverty have increased needs for supportive services to enable them to learn. Learning does not occur in isolation. With recent news events, we have seen the effects of not providing sufficient mental health services in our society. Teachers are being asked to monitor student progress with new procedures and school psychologists provide valuable assistance with data collection and interpretation. I implore the school system to reconsider this decision and restore the positions for the sake of our students, staff and the families in Polk County.

    "DiffbotBody": "Enlarge photo Jim Cole/Associated Press Michael O’Connor, curator of the Enfield Shaker Museum and volunteer archaeologist, searches for the foundation of the trustees building from Shaker village in Enfield, N.H. This community of Shakers, or the “United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearance”, settled on the shores of Mascoma Lake in 1793. ENFIELD, N.H. – For more than a century, the long-gone trustees building at a Shaker village on the shore of New Hampshire’s Mascoma Lake was where the members of a nearly extinct religious society met the outside world. An archaeological dig that started this summer on the pastoral grounds where the building once stood has the potential to reveal and renew the space so it can once again serve as a bridge between Shaker and secular cultures. “It’s a big order,” said Michael O’Connor, curator of the Enfield Shaker Museum and an eager volunteer archaeologist working on the project. “We’d like to have a better sense of the use of this building. We’ll define our sense of the space as the Shakers used fences to define their sense of the space.” The Shakers – or the “United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearance” – settled by the lake in 1793, the ninth of 18 communities established in the New World after the society fled persecution in England. The communities, including another New Hampshire site in Canterbury, practiced equality of the sexes, pacificism, communal ownership of property and celibacy. It was the last that ultimately spelled the demise of the Shakers just about everywhere: There are believed to be just four known remaining Shakers, all at the Sabbathday Lake community in Maine. That injects a sense of urgency into research efforts. “They are truly ready for archaeology,” said Plymouth State University professor David Starbuck, who is leading the dig. “This can be a place to start developing a permanent field space. It’s places where you can continue to tell stories afterward.” At Enfield, where about 300 souls eventually settled, the society constructed the largest Shaker building ever built, The Great Stone Dwelling. At six stories of granite, it was once the tallest building north of Boston, and its cupola still commands a breathtaking view of Mascoma Lake and the valley beneath Mount Assurance. Directly in front of the dwelling stood the trustees building. In the early days of the dig, the green expanse was pocked with rectangular pits as students and others carefully dug through the sod looking for secrets. Near the top of the pits, they used spades to move bigger pieces of earth; when they reach artifacts such as foundations, trowels were used for the more intricate excavation. Portable artifacts, like pieces of pottery or utensils, are carried over to “the lab” housed in the Shakers’ 1849 stone mill building. The Shakers are perhaps best known for their hand-crafted housewares like baskets and, notably, their furniture – especially chairs – that is still easily recognized by its unadorned simplicity and superior quality. “We know a tremendous amount about Shaker decorative arts. There are dozens and dozens of books about their furniture and architectural style but we really need to do a lot more research into their daily life,” said Starlyn D’Angelo, executive director of the Shaker Heritage Society of Albany, New York, near where the society’s founder, Mother Ann Lee, settled in the late 18th century. “The archaeology that is being done can help us understand what they were like, what their lifestyle was like,” D’Angelo said. “Maybe we’ll find china where you’d never expect. So it tells us that maybe people brought it into the community. It tells us who was moving into the communities.” Starbuck, who also works at military sites in upstate New York, said there’s a different feel when working at a religious site. “I do think there is a great reverence and respect for the Shakers who once lived there,” he said. “It’s not digging up the remains of just anyone. It’s people who truly tried to live a very deep, spiritual existence.” A long-range goal, O’Connor said, is to use the archaeological findings as part of an interpretive display built on the same demarcations as the old trustees building, a fitting next chapter for the centuries-old site. The Shakers left Enfield at the end of the 1920s and sold their buildings to the La Salette religious order.

    "DiffbotBody": "Saratoga Springs It's odd driving into an apartment complex for dinner. But that's where BWP — the letters stand for beer, wine, pizza — is conveniently nested, within the residential quadrant of The Springs. The Springs, its name pinched from its Saratoga location, is a newly built, high-end apartment complex just off Northway Exit 15. Out where architectural sights are limited to a big-box stores, The Springs is a model showroom for suburban utopia. Orderly apartments built around a manicured, communal village green are a throwback to merry olde England. On-site amenities include a nail salon, barbershop, hairdresser, dry cleaner, day care, gym, martial arts classes and BWP. Welcome to the future of suburban living: simplified and spoon-fed. One-stop living. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave. BWP is part bar, part fast-casual burger joint, and on a cool but sunny evening, the groups chattering over beers at outdoor fire-pit tables could not have provided a more effective siren call to apartment-dwelling residents. At least six apartments are stacked right on top. Indoors, a huge bar runs nearly the full length of the room, televisions broadcast sports, and families fresh from Little League night cluster around dining tables near the open kitchen. BWP uses all the right watchwords and talks a good game about craft beer, boutique wine, burger construction, gluten-free options, hand-tossed thin pizza and all things all natural and locally sourced. The walls, like the menus, are emblazoned with fun chalkboard drawings deconstructing their burgers and pizzas — BWP's special spices, the 700-degree wood-fired oven and all-natural ground beef. But, in the end, side salads are shredded iceberg, food is slapped down in melamine bowls or plastic baskets lined with checkerboard paper, and service is in the hands of coolly aloof college-age servers. I may have fast-casual fatigue, but I'm not 6 years old, and I wasn't ordering outside. I can handle a china plate. In honor of National Burger Day, I honed in on a California burger ($10.95), a decent pick topped with rather soupy guacamole, fresh peppers, tomato and kale. I chewed, but the \"secret\" \"BurgerSpice\" flavor promised on chalkboard and website failed to show up. My husband's Bleu Burger ($10.95) slid the bar a little lower. My burger was successfully medium rare; his was overdone, crumbly and saddled with fatty bacon. As the third restaurant for Tim and Colleen Holmes, owners of the popular Wheatfields restaurant in Saratoga and Wheatfields Bistro in Clifton Park, the menu isn't restricted to pizzas and burgers. If you've just driven home and this is your de facto kitchen, you might be in the mood for \"knife and fork\" entrées (less than $17), a mix of proteins, salads and daily specials with recommended beer pairings. Otherwise, nachos, onion rings and other bar staples can soak up that after-work pint. Steamers in beer broth with BWP flatbread ($11.95), served in an egg-shaped plastic bowl, were brutal. Little wizened clams recoiled from broth bitter from a hoppy ale reduction, stewy with onion and containing at least twice the recommended daily salt intake. The eponymous flatbread was flat-out stale. If I were BWP, I wouldn't put my name to it. Hand-cut Saratoga chips with blue cheese sauce ($11.95) arrived lukewarm, helplessly sweating in a plastic dish. A promising idea, but they should pop into DP: An American Brasserie in Albany to see this dish done well, and for $3 less. Service was intriguing. A busy, hands-on manager was everywhere, helping at the hostess station and checking on the kitchen, but youthful servers with that well-practiced air of disinterest plonked plates on tables, checked cellphones and bantered with kitchen staff. After waiting 15 minutes for a dessert, we tried to cancel it; this was apparently our problem and an annoyance to our waitress. BWP desserts are made by local baker J \u0026 S Watkins, but the microwaved apple crisp ($5.95) arrived with more geothermal steam than a Yellowstone fumarole and had coagulated into oatmeal porridge under pressure. Let's call a spade a spade: BWP is formulaic but mostly successful at what it does, given the low aspirations it seems to have. It's a massive convenience for the built-in bedroom community to have an on-site watering hole that works equally for families or social neighbors. It's campus dining, a spot for a solitary beer and burger or family pizza on the fly. And the mix of craft beers nicely highlights many local breweries, a fact seemingly appreciated by all the men — there were only men — at the bar and on the patio outside. I hurried my husband away when he began to find something attractive in the whole setup. It's a Huxleyan Brave New World where all needs are met: You can sleep, workout, get a manicure, watch sports TV, pick up dry cleaning, drink beer and cram food in your mouth after sliding home on the Northway. BWP lacks soul, but might be just the right fast-food call with hungry family in tow. Dinner for two — including two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert and two beers — came to $82.30 with tax and tip. Susie Davidson Powell is a freelancer writer from East Greenbush.

    "DiffbotBody": "Lemurs Have Biggest Testicles of all Primates TORONTO – Despite the dubbed name, giant mouse creature, it has abnormally large body parts that one would not think of when they think of just an abnormally large mouse. According to a new study, the has the largest pair of testicles known to a primate. This 11 pounce little mouse-like creature is surprisingly well endowed for its small size and mouse like demeanor. Researchers from the Oxford Brooks University, the Bristol Zoological Society, and the German Primate Center, have all come to discover this odd yet fascinating fact about the species known as the lemur. They have found that the testicles that the lemurs possess are abnormally large to their overall body mass. To compare to this to a human, if a man possess this same comparison, this man would have testicles the size of a grapefruit. This has been discovered by tracking the lemur. The lemur is able to mate all year round. It has even been found through tracking this animal that the lemur travels in search of a potential mate. This has been called a promiscuous form of mating also known as the scramble strategy. Scientists have collected this new information because of the fact that the lemur is on this list of the animals that are in danger of extinction. The finding of this new information was just secondary to the real goal of finding a way to prevent the extinction of these tiny creatures. It has always been curious as to why lemurs were called giant mouses. Now that they have found something giant about the creatures, researchers now know where the name originated from. Currently lemurs are on the red list of endangered species due to the large reduction of numbers in the last few years. The reduction of numbers is due to the destruction of their natural habitat.

According to a new study, the lemur has the largest pair of testicles known to a primate. This 11 pounce little mouse-like creature is surprisingly well endowed for its small size and mouse like demeanor. Researchers from the Oxford Brooks University, the Bristol Zoological Society, and the German Primate Center, have all come to discover this odd yet fascinating fact about the species known as the lemur. They have found that the testicles that the lemurs possess are abnormally large to their overall body mass. To compare to this to a human, if a man possess this same comparison, this man would have testicles the size of a grapefruit. This has been discovered by tracking the lemur. The lemur is able to mate all year round. It has even been found through tracking this animal that the lemur travels in search of a potential mate. This has been called a promiscuous form of mating also known as the scramble strategy. Scientists have collected this new information because of the fact that the lemur is on this list of the animals that are in danger of extinction. The finding of this new information was just secondary to the real goal of finding a way to prevent the extinction of these tiny creatures. It has always been curious as to why lemurs were called giant mouses. Now that they have found something giant about the creatures, researchers now know where the name originated from. Currently lemurs are on the red list of endangered species due to the large reduction of numbers in the last few years. The reduction of numbers is due to the destruction of their natural habitat.",

    "DiffbotBody": "In his first book, author Jason Smith explores the depravity and desperation required to maintain an opiate addiction so fierce, he finds himself jumping continents to avoid jail time and learns the hard way that some demons cannot be outrun. While teaching in Europe, he meets a prostitute who secures drugs for him at the dangerous price of helping out the Russian mafia; in China, he gets his Percocet and Xanax fix but terrifies a crowd of children and parents at his job in the process; and in Mexico, Smith thought a Tijuana jail cell would be the perfect place to kick his Fentanyl habit, but soon realizes that the power of addiction is stronger than his desire to escape it. The Bitter Taste of Dying paints a portrait of the modern day drug addict with clarity and refreshing honesty. With a gritty mixture of self-deprecation and light-hearted confessional, Smith’s memoir deftly describes the journey into the harrowing depths of addiction and demonstrates the experience of finally being released from it.",

    "DiffbotBody": "'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Tuesday, July 7, 2015, 9:00 p.m. I love grilling vegetables because doing so concentrates their natural sugars and amps up their flavor. During the summer, the usual suspects are zucchini, eggplant, onions, peppers and corn. They're all delicious this way and — Bonus! — they all become tender in an agreeably short amount of time. But it recently occurred to me that a number of the veggies I love roasting in the oven — broccoli, cauliflower and carrots — might also shine if cooked on the grill. Turns out, they do! The first problem was to figure out how to cut these vegetables so they wouldn't fall through the slats of the grill grates. The solution was to keep them in big pieces; I cut the carrots in half lengthwise, left the broccoli attached at the stalk, and sliced the cauliflower head straight down into half-inch cutlets (or “steaks”). These precautions kept the vegetables from falling into the flames, which allowed me to discover that it took forever for them to become tender. To speed up the process, I started by blanching them. After this quick bath in boiling water, I popped the vegetables in ice water to stop the cooking, then made sure they were dry before oiling, seasoning and grilling. Suddenly, these guys took no time at all to get tender. And they browned nicely along the way. Yay! Also, sure enough, their flavor became concentrated, just as it does when roasted. Indeed, it was assertive enough to pair up with a tahini sauce and spicy panko crumbs. When the vegetables are this robust, you may even decide you don't need the grilled steak. Chef Sara Moulton writes this column for the Associated Press. Grilled Vegetables With Tahini Sauce and Spicy Panko Start to finish: 1 hour 1⁄4 cup tahini, well stirred 2 1⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons water, plus more if needed for sauce 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt 1⁄2 cup panko bread crumbs 1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper Water for cooking and cooling vegetables Ice 1 head broccoli, quartered down the center 1 small head cauliflower, sliced into 1⁄2-inch-thick “steaks” 6 large carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise Vegetable or canola oil, for brushing the vegetables Freshly ground black pepper In a medium bowl, stir together the tahini, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the water, lemon juice, garlic and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt. Add additional water if necessary to achieve a pourable consistency. Set aside. In a large skillet over medium, heat the remaining 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the crushed red pepper and a hefty pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the bread crumbs turn golden, for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a grill to medium. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice and water and place it next to the pot. Add the broccoli and cook it for 2 minutes. Use tongs to remove the broccoli from the water and place it in the ice water. Cool it completely, then pat dry with paper towels. Repeat this process with the cauliflower and carrots, cooking the cauliflower for 2 minutes and the carrots for 3 minutes. Brush all of the vegetables well on both sides with vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper and, working in batches if necessary, grill them on direct medium heat, with the grill covered, until they have distinct grill marks on the bottom, for about 5 minutes. Turn them over and grill on the second side until they have distinct grill marks on the second side and are tender, for about another 5 minutes. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, drizzle with the tahini sauce and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.

It’s not the money, and it probably has nothing to do with job security. While a handful of people say it’s an important steppingstone along their career path, to be honest, it likely isn’t that, either. The answer? It’s simple: to earn a paycheck while enjoying the outdoors. Ironically, for supply-chain and communication reasons, a lot of our favorite gear companies are based out of cities, straying even further from the outdoorsy life they once sought. However, a dedicated few have decided to operate from their mountain playgrounds, skirting logistical hurdles in order to live the lifestyle that they themselves promote. “I think that the people that start brands [in mountain towns] and work here are happier,” says Cody Townsend, a professional skier and founder of Tahoe, California-based Arcade Belts. “We are all active individuals and we like to be outside and having that on our doorstep. We’re not weekend warriors; we live it.” We took a look around the industry to find the guys and gals making the gear that enhances their already active lifestyles. Here are a handful of our favorite mountain town brands living the dream around the country. Big Agnes Tents, Steamboat Springs, Colorado Perfect weekend in the Wind Rivers with lots of sticks and soft grass to chew them on. John Evans #copperspur #sleepinthedirt A photo posted by Big Agnes (@bigagnes_) on Jun 29, 2015 at 1:37pm PDT What many people don’t know is that one of the ultimate providers of camping gear in the U.S. was born from Colorado backpackers looking to create something dependable, locally. All of Big Agnes’ products are named after adventures the team has personally embarked upon in the local wilderness, and the company is also heavily invested in local projects like the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative (a climbing organization) and the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, leading us to think that the collective at Big Agnes doesn’t have plans to leave the mountains anytime soon. Give’r Apparel, Jackson, Wyoming New spring products have arrived! @robtmcc sporting the new Bold Bison Trucker (available in two colors). Check out give-r.com for all the new products! #jacksonhole A photo posted by GIVE’R™ (@giverjh) on Apr 13, 2015 at 9:07am PDT Jackson has collected quite a few outdoor brands over the years — Cloudveil started up shop here in 1995, for example — and the expansion of its airport has certainly helped foster entrepreneurial growth in the region. One of those creative seeds was planted by a trio of East Coast transplants looking to design apparel that represented Jackson’s unique slice of paradise. It has grown into Give’r, which produces hats, shirts, sunglasses and more that speak to the Teton identity while giving its creators a chance to spend as much time on the river or in the mountains as they can fit into their work day. Sure beats a lunch break at Taco Bell. Arcade Belts, Lake Tahoe, California Arcade Belts aims to destroy the conventional ideal that belts can’t be comfy and cool. Photo: Courtesy of Arcade Belts Started by professional skier Cody Townsend (you may remember his impossible ski video from this earlier this year) and a few of his Tahoe compadres, Arcade Belts has been keeping waistlines covered for the better part of a half decade. The goal was to create a belt that could keep up with their active lifestyles and wouldn’t cost an arm and a leg in the process. The solution? Arcade has popularized an elastic belt with a plastic buckle perfect for anything outdoorsy, travel focused and beyond. Townsend also notes that since the company headquarters sits at the base of Squaw Valley Resort, there are plenty of “work meetings” that happen on the chairlift or on the singletrack. Mystery Ranch Backpacks, Bozeman, Montana A photo posted by Mystery Ranch (@mysteryranch) on Nov 14, 2014 at 9:05am PST This pack company has a rich mountain-town history that extends all the way back into the 1970s. Midwestern climber Dana Gleason had moved to Bozeman and fallen in love with the Montana landscape; he started up Kletterwerks Backpacks to produce handmade trekking and climbing packs. Eventually, Kletterwerks gave birth to Mystery Ranch, which has systematically become the premier backpack for ski touring and trekking, even providing product direct to military and firefighting personnel. Despite massive success in the outdoor market, they have chosen to keep their roots in Bozeman over larger urban hubs. Hydro Flask, Bend, Oregon It’s not hard for the folks at Hydro Flask to find a little peace and quiet after a long day. Photo: Courtesy of Tyler Roemer/Hydro Flask It’s no secret that Bend, Oregon, is an outdoor-lover’s paradise, but until recently very few brands have made a go of it in this mountain oasis. Hydro Flask changed that by flipping the water-bottle game on its head, introducing a revolutionary double-wall vacuum-insulated water bottle perfect for keeping liquids cold (or hot) despite the extreme conditions outside. With their offices literally minutes from some of the best mountain biking and trail running in the country, there is no shortage of reasons to try out their newest innovations in the field.

A bloated 13ft African rock python ate itself to death after its innards were punctured with dozens of quills from the spiky 2st rodent.

According to Yahoo, Reserve managers found it python dead beneath a rocky ledge, where it had been trying to digest its final meal. Reserve general manager Jennifer Fuller said: “The exact reasons for the snake’s death are not clear. “It is apparent that several porcupine quills were lodged inside the digestive tract. “It had fallen off the rocky ledge. “We don’t know if it died beforehand, or whether the fall drove some of the quills into its digestive tract.” Some predators will see the quills and know that it’s not a meal. Many snake species rely on thermal or chemical sensory mechanisms to ambush prey at night. In the 2003 study, entitled “Prickly food: snakes preying upon porcupines,” researchers found that when a snake eats a porcupine, the animal’s quills are left undigested and are easily detectable in the snake’s gut. Sometimes, the quills will even pierce all the way through the snake’s body, according to the study. But there’s no word yet on whether this particular snake died because it was pierced by quills or because it fell off a ledge (or because it was pierced by quills as a result of falling off the ledge), Fuller told the Australian news website News.com. below is a rather NSFW video, largely due to one image, of the incident.

Police say the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed when she crashed into a pillar, as well as two parked cars. Instead of spending their mornings with algebra equations and history lessons in summer school, kids from Glendale, La Crescenta, Burbank and other nearby cities took a field trip to the Biscailuz Training Center in Los Angeles, to get a first-hand look at how some Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department units operate. A group of student musicians is getting ready for their debut performance tonight. The kids are members of the nonprofit Caesura Youth Orchestra, which aims to offer music instruction to more Glendale students. Volunteers are being sought by the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. for its docent program. The organization will hold an informational meeting for potential docents from 10 a.m. to noon on Saturday, July 18 at the zoo’s Witherbee Auditorium. The Glendale Police Department is offering residents residents a 10-week community academy to go behind the scenes of police work. The class is limited to 35 participants and will run from Aug. 12 to Oct. 21 on Wednesday evenings.",

    "DiffbotBody": "By Niels Lesniewski 3 Tweet ©Reprints Suu Kyi, center, received a Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony in the Capitol in September 2012. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call File Photo) Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor Thursday morning to express frustration about the pace of change in Myanmar. The Kentucky Republican warned he would push for delays in furthering trade relations with the country, which is also known as Burma, after a bid to overhaul the Southeast Asian nation’s constitution was thwarted. “Those of us who’ve followed Burma also know that, given its history, the military fears change, ethnic unrest, and the uncertainty that more democratic government might bring. That’s well-acknowledged. But improving relations with the United States meant both sides would have to take some risks. This was a moment for the military to take another important step on its end, and this was a missed opportunity,” McConnell said. Myanmar was governed for years by a repressive military junta and has taken steps toward democracy, but in his floor statement, McConnell reiterated previous concerns with restrictions on eligibility for public office contained in the country’s current constitution. “There’s little doubt that Burma’s constitution contains numerous flaws that need to be revised if the government is to be truly representative,” McConnell said. “First, it unreasonably restricts who can be a candidate for president — a not-so-subtle attempt to bar the country’s most popular opposition figure from even standing for office. But then it goes even further, ensuring an effective military veto over constitutional change — for instance, amendments about who can run for the presidency — by requiring more than three-fourths parliamentary support in a legislature where the constitution also reserves one-fourth of seats for the military.” McConnell is making a clear reference to Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader with whom he has long had a close relationship. McConnell called for postponing some efforts to normalize relations until after Burma’s fall elections. “In light of the recent defeat of constitutional reform, I believe that steps, such as including Burma in the Generalized System of Preferences program, should be put on hold until after this fall’s election. Only after the ballots have been cast and counted in Burma can an appropriate evaluation be made about the pace of reform in the country and whether additional normalization of relations is warranted,” McConnell said.

    "DiffbotBody": "As the leader of San Francisco noise rock band Sic Alps, Mike Donovan was an advocate for madness in an increasingly well-behaved city. But by the time the singer dissolved the group in 2013—following four full-lengths and a number of singles—it seemed like he, too, needed a breather. Not long after Sic Alps called it quits, he released a solo record, Wot, under his own name. On Wot, Donovan took a break from skronk and hiss, focusing instead on acoustic guitar-driven sounds inspired by '60s folk and country music. The production values were more traditional and the subject matter slightly more earthly and universal. It was a relaxed and pretty set of songs, which may have been to its disadvantage. If you were drawn to Alps' for the topsy-turvy sounds, Wot might have come off a bit staid. In this sense, Peacers' self-titled LP is a course correction. Ostensibly a band, Peacers was recorded by Donovan and long-time collaborator and former San Francisco cohort, Ty Segall, who produced the album and performed on a number of the songs. It's not exactly Sic Alps Mk. II, but there are some clear similarities. The record's eerie psychedelic pop strikes a similar balance of order and chaos, with songs that rev up only to be subverted by detours into dissonance and static. The music is often wobbly and disjointed, with tracks like \"Mary Jane/Glorious Sunrise\" and \"Drama Ensues\" congealing into a groove only to vaporize with little resolution. The musical reference points have shifted away from Bob Dylan and back toward Syd Barrett and Tronics. As a singer, Donovan has exited his folkie phase and returned to his old self—tuneful, but disturbed, like a zombie Marc Bolan. And the bad vibes abound. Bitterness was a key component of Sic Alps. Living in a rapidly gentrifying San Francisco, Donovan and his bandmates sounded like defiant weirdo survivors, fending off a rising tide of dotcom normies. As their hometown buffed up, they staked a claim in the psychedelic fringe, willful outsiders keeping the candle lit for the city's storied '60s subculture. The band's final EP came with the epigraph, \"Digger gold vs. Google dorm. Real SF will rise again.\" Peacers feels like a continuation of that attitude, though apart from one or two moments—closing cut \"Super Francisco\"—it's rare that the message is clearly stated. Rather, it's implied in the disquieting and rubbery nature of the music. Donovan's songs plot out a course toward a grimmer, grimier, and freakier world. And depending on your perspective, that may be an attractive destination.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A team of researchers from MIT have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code. It turns out software and fruit have something in common: they both can rot. But while a banana that’s been sitting out too long can’t turn fresh again, old software code that no longer functions like it once did can be revitalized. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the university’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code, MIT said this week. This is a big deal for companies that might spend thousands of dollars on developers to restore old software that may not work as efficiently as it once did. Often times software programs written several years ago no longer function properly on the latest computers and hardware, explained MIT Professor Saman Amarasinghe in an interview with Fortune. The reason is because software has to be tailored to work for computers. Each time hardware technology advances and the performance of machines increases, a software program needs to get rejiggered to accommodate the changes. Typically, coders spend a lot of hours going through the program’s software to make changes, add more lines of code, and add algorithms that ensure that the software works efficiently with the hardware specs of the day. However, each time a programmer tweaks the software and adds new code, the program steadily becomes more bloated. Additionally, the algorithms and extra code used to match the software to current hardware specifications can often become invalidated as the next-generation gear launches into the market. Coders can have a difficult time removing all the extras, which leads to a program that experiences what is known as software rot. Once the code is rotten, the program as a whole can be slow as molasses and even unresponsive when you try to get it up and running. This is where the MIT researchers come in. The MIT team developed a software system called Helium that basically scans the rotten software, discovers the most crucial lines of code that the original programmers developed to make it function, and then builds a revised version of the program that works with the hardware specs that the MIT team wants it to match. What used to be a month’s long process, the MIT researchers claim can now be cut down to an hour. Amarasinghe explained that MIT tested out its Helium system with some engineers from Adobe ADBE -0.57% who were looking for ways to make the over-two-decade-old Photoshop program run faster and process images more quickly with the advancements in modern hardware tech. Whereas Google and Facebook have been running software that might be as young as three years, Adobe and other companies might have programs or applications that haven’t aged too well as the years have gone by, Amarasinghe said. In this case, the Adobe engineers wanted a way to make Photoshop run better without having to spend the traditional man-power needed to do the job. MIT claims that when they used Helium to revise Photoshop, the program’s performance increased by 75 percent. Say goodbye to the slow loading times for your favorite vacation pictures you want to make more colorful. As of now, Helium is not quite ready for primetime and it could be a few more years before it’s ready for widespread use, Amarasinghe said. Adobe was only testing out Helium and is not going to be using it in its products as of now. Also, while Helium can restore older code, it currently only works on image-processing software like Photoshop, because getting a program to display an image is a relatively easier task compared to other more complex software, he said. Still, if Helium pans out, Amarasinghe said it could have a lot of benefits to businesses. The healthcare industry, for example could save a lot of time having to upgrade their image-processing software for medical devices like X-ray machines as the hardware advances.

Judge Dave Le Brannon ruled Thursday that David Chiddo may have time with his family’s cremated remains at his attorney’s office at the discretion of the U.S. Marshals Service. Police believe 53-year-old Nilda Sheffield fatally shot her 30-year-old daughter Elizabeth Flores and grandchildren Xavier and Sofia on June 27 before killing herself. The Palm Beach Post reported attorney Flynn Parker Bertisch was denied a request to have Chiddo attend Thursday night’s memorial service. The U.S. Attorney’s Office opposed any kind of visit, citing Chiddo’s criminal history. Chiddo has been in custody since June 4 and faces an Oct. 5 trial.

The only problem with that is, it’s not remotely true. Somehow, the spin doctors at the White House always manage to cherry pick rare instances of economic improvement and turn them into something much bigger. If you want a real indication of how President Barack Obama’s economy is fairing, just look to a recent report that shows a coming “retail apocalypse,” with major retailers across the country planning on shutting the doors to thousands of stores due to a sharp decline in discretionary consumer spending. Some of the major retailers who plan on closing at least 10 stores over the next year or so include Radio Shack, Office Depot/Office Max, Dollar Tree/Family Dollar, Walgreens, Barnes \u0026 Noble, Macy’s, Sears and JCPenney. The full list, which can be found below, contains names of powerhouse retailers that drive the consumer economy almost on their own. Most malls around the country sport a Sears store along with a Macy’s or JCPenney and experts are advising not to be surprised to see the doors of many of those stores shuttered over the next year or so. “Expect to see more storefronts closed at malls across the country,” one retail watcher told WND. “It’s getting ugly out there.” So what else is the problem? For one, Americans are maxing out their credit cards far too early into the year and some of that can be blamed on higher health insurance costs (thanks, Obama) and rising taxes (thanks, Obama). Retail watchers expect that lower middle-class and poor neighborhoods will be hit hard by the closings. Situations like the Baltimore race riots only make retailers more skittish about expanding. These big retailers closing their doors means thousands of lost jobs, if not more. That starts the economy on a wicked downturn that will require strong fiscal leadership in the White House.

A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jul 9, 2015 at 12:11pm PDT Kim Kardashian continues her Instagram (and world) domination with the reveal of her new wax figure at Madame Tussauds in London. The figure is wearing a replica of the amazing Balmain dress she wore when out and about in Paris during her pre-wedding festivities. The best part of the figure is you can now fulfill your lifelong dreams of taking a selfie with the selfie queen. Her replica is holding a real phone, so you can pose for as many selfies as your heart desires. However, there are some lucky people who have pictures with the real deal, and one of those is Nick Cannon. He recently unearthed a throwback pic of him and Kim K. and posted it to the ‘Gram. Unfortunately, fans weren’t really feeling his post. The picture is from around ten years ago, when the two were briefly dating. However, many fans thought the posting was rather inappropriate considering Kim is currently married and pregnant. Comments ranged from “Mane [sic] sit your dumbass down, you punk you! What you tryna say or prove…yeezy coming for you.” to “This is why mariah doesnt fwu lmaooo.” In his defense, he also posted several other throwbacks right before the picture of him and Kim.

    "DiffbotBody": "Peggy Woolsey Given the bacon mania sweeping the nation, it's not too difficult to imagine that Ari Miller, founder of the local bacon and charcuterie outfit 1732 Meats, is truly living the dream. Sitting in the office of his new production space in Yeadon, he explains, \"I'm the luckiest man on the face of the planet. I have a beautiful wife and amazing children who are so much smarter than me, and I can get up every morning and go to a job that I like doing. You can't beat that.\" Add a few slices of his signature Garlic Insanity bacon, a whiff of the lamb prosciutto that he has curing in the newly opened wholesale production facility, plus a roster of fantastic restaurants that have been using his meats regularly for a while now, it's not hard to understand where Miller is coming from. But like most people who are living the dream (whether bacon is involved or not), the story and the meats have been in the works for a while. Born in the Bay Area, Miller's childhood father-son bonding time was spent frequenting farmers markets, searching out the greasiest of greasy spoons and driving to Napa in search of small-production stinky cheeses. With a background like that, Miller's love of eating percolated on the back burner while he pursued a career in banking. The move to Philly happened in November 1998 by way of his wife and 1732 Meats partner, Elise. \"When a pretty lady says she'll marry you, you move,\" Miller says. Back then the food scene in Philly was nothing like it is today. Vetri was in its first years and aside from a handful of major players like Le Bec-Fin and Susanna Foo, the bar was pretty low, at least in Miller's recollection. \"There were five or six restaurants at the top and then there was a precipitous drop to everyone serving bad hoagies and cheesesteaks,\" he says. It was around that time that Miller set out to make his first batch of bacon. One fortuitous day a craving for garlic bacon came that he couldn't shake. It wasn't a product that he'd sampled before, nor was it available at the city's small selection of gourmet grocers. So in his typically industrious fashion, Miller bought himself a copy of the definitive Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking andCuring by Michael Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn. After an in-depth search for an essential curing ingredient, sodium nitrite (these were the days before everything-Amazon), Miller's amateur bacon-making experiment was up and running. Miller says that his wife likes to joke that he doesn't know how to cook for two or four people; when he hits the kitchen, there's enough for the whole neighborhood. And after a while, he started getting the response that so many gifted home cooks often receive when friends and family taste their wares: \"This is so fantastic! You should really go into business.\" Working as a branch manager of a Main Line bank, Miller's knowledge of customer service and what makes a successful business had been honed well enough for Miller to know that the restaurant business was not for him. But he was looking for a change. He decided to go back to school, not for cooking or hospitality, but for law. About a year and a half into taking night classes at Temple and working full time, he realized that becoming a lawyer wasn't his calling either. But instead of dropping out, he finished his degree and opted not to take the bar exam. \"I graduated in 2013,\" Miller says. \"And all I could see is massive amounts of free time and I don't do well with free time. I need something to do.\" Miller lives with his wife and two daughters in a Lansdowne home built in 1732 (hence his company's name) as part of the borough's founding farm. With a home base like that, his connection to the community runs deep. Seeing a lack of meat vendors at the weekly Lansdowne farmers market, Miller decided that it would be an ideal outlet for his bacon, and a way to combat all of that spare time. When he ran the idea by his wife, she had her fair share of reservations. \"Elise said to me fatefully, 'OK, but we're going to keep it small.'\" Miller explains. \"And I said, 'Absolutely.'\" With a 9,100-square-foot plant in Yeadon that opened in April, it's clear that Miller might not have told the full truth when talking to his wife that day, but that's not really a bad thing. Currently 1732 Meats makes four varieties of bacon (Garlic Insanity, black peppercorn, jalapeño and Spanish smoked paprika) and is getting ready to roll out a line of charcuterie in the next week or so that includes everything from pancetta to sumac-cured Wagyu bresaola, along with Italian classics like coppa and guanciale. Miller's meaty dreams are paying off big time. His meats can be purchased at all of the Di Bruno Bros. and Green Aisle Grocery locations as well as at the Fair Food Farmstead at Reading Terminal, and his charcuterie is going to hit the menus of plenty of restaurants in town very soon, including Brigantessa and Capofitto.",

    "DiffbotBody": "One of the problems of the big data phenomenon is figuring out how to provide enough storage for the mind-bogglingly huge data sets being generated by scientists, researchers, governments, and private companies every day. The thing is, we’re making this particular dilemma worse all the time, because we’re creating and capturing more raw data than ever before. A study in 2013 found that 90 percent of all the data in the world had been generated in the preceding two years alone, creating huge logistical challenges for those whose job it is to make sure that this tidal wave of information is properly preserved for current and future purposes. So who’s the biggest culprit when it comes to generating untold amounts of data? If you guessed YouTube, you’re right. With people uploading some 300 hours of video to the service every single minute, it generates about 100 petabytes of data per year (ie. 100,000 terabytes, if that helps). Luckily, Google’s not exactly short of a buck, so it’s presumably got the resources to deal with the flood. But data generators in other areas might not be so well prepared. A new study by researchers at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the US says that the field of genomics is the fastest-growing data generator in the world today, with the quantity of genetic data being produced on a daily basis doubling every seven months at the current rate. The research, published in PLOS Biology, suggests that by 2025, genome scientists will be way ahead of YouTube and Twitter, and also the current reigning data kings in science: astronomy and physics. In 10 years’ time, genetics researchers will be producing somewhere between 2 and 40 exabytes of data every year, depending on how the rate of doubling pans out. (For those still paying attention, an exabyte is 1,000 petabytes.) \"For a very long time, people have used the adjective ‘astronomical’ to talk about things that are really, truly huge,” Michael Schatz, a co-author of the research, said in a press release. “But in pointing out the incredible pace of growth of data-generation in the biological sciences, my colleagues and I are suggesting we may need to start calling truly immense things ‘genomical’ in the years just ahead.” The researchers say the current level of genome data, estimated to be about 25 petabytes, is more than manageable, but that’s mostly because comparatively few people have had their genome sequenced. Indications are that this is about to change, with expectations that as many as 1 billion people will have their full genomes sequenced over the course of the next decade, mostly in rich countries. While the medical benefits posed by genome research are expected to offer some amazing health solutions within that timeframe, it sounds like the problems for the data scientists are just beginning. “Genomics is a game-changing science in so many ways,” said Schatz. “My colleagues and I are saying that it’s important to think about the future so that we are ready for it.”",

F. Philip Handy, board president of both the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was launched by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in 2008, and the Foundation for Florida’s Future, discussed education reform in the state. J. Alex Kelly, vice president of advocacy for ExcelinEd, also spoke during the Meet the Minds luncheon on June 30. “It is crucial that we have the help of the business community in our fight to reform education,” said Handy during his presentation. “While Florida is improving when it comes to education, reform isn’t done. The measure of success is student achievement, and we measure that against national standards.” Florida was the first state to adopt and implement the A-F school grading policy, which according to Handy and Kelly is the most transparent and empowering school-rating policy in the country. Sixteen other states around the nation have followed Florida’s lead in adopting A-F School grading. Florida’s K-3 reading law has also been replicated in 10 states. The comprehensive kindergarten through third grade reading policy has resulted in dramatic improvements in literacy. — Submitted by Candice McElyea Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

Alex Kelly, vice president of advocacy for ExcelinEd, also spoke during the Meet the Minds luncheon on June 30. “It is crucial that we have the help of the business community in our fight to reform education,” said Handy during his presentation. “While Florida is improving when it comes to education, reform isn’t done. The measure of success is student achievement, and we measure that against national standards.” Florida was the first state to adopt and implement the A-F school grading policy, which according to Handy and Kelly is the most transparent and empowering school-rating policy in the country. Sixteen other states around the nation have followed Florida’s lead in adopting A-F School grading. Florida’s K-3 reading law has also been replicated in 10 states. The comprehensive kindergarten through third grade reading policy has resulted in dramatic improvements in literacy. — Submitted by Candice McElyea.",

For the latest news and views on gas, coal, electricity and more, check out On the Grid today. 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Saturday, July 11, 2015, 12:01 a.m. WASHINGTON — Parents may hesitate to hand teens the keys to the family car, but Congress is proposing to allow drivers as young as 18 to get behind the wheel of big rigs on the nation's interstates. Federal regulations require drivers be at least 21 before they can drive commercial trucks across state lines, but a bill introduced this week by Republican senators would allow contiguous states that join together in “compacts” to drop the age threshold to 18 for interstate trips. There is no limit on the number of states that could join the compacts. After four years, the Transportation secretary is supposed to report to Congress on whether teens have “an equivalent level of safety” in comparison with older truckers. In 2013, all drivers ages 18-20 had a fatal crash involvement rate, per 100,000 licensed drivers, that was 66 percent higher than drivers who were age 21 years or older, according to the Transportation Department's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, although the total number of crash deaths among teens has been declining since 2002. The change was sought by the trucking industry to help address a shortage of truck drivers. The American Trucking Association estimates that the current shortage of drivers is roughly 35,000 to 40,000, but because of retirements and individuals leaving the industry, trucking companies will need to recruit nearly 100,000 new drivers a year over the next decade to keep pace with the country's freight needs. But Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said allowing teens to drive trucks weighing as much as 80,000 pounds and to work as many as 82 hours a week, as is permitted in the truck industry, is a “catastrophe waiting to happen.” “The combination of inexperience, high-risk driving and large trucks can cause unbelievable devastation,” she said. Dave Osiecki, chief of advocacy for trucking associations, said states already allow teens to drive commercial trucks unlimited miles within their borders. For example, it makes no sense to allow a teen truck driver to drive hundreds of miles from one end to the other of a state like Virginia, but prohibit the same driver from crossing the Potomac River into Washington, he said. “We absolutely support” lowering the age limit, he said. “It would be good for our industry, it would be good for commerce, it would be good for the economy.” Legislation to allow states to lower the age for a commercial, interstate license to 18 was first introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and was incorporated into a larger transportation bill introduced this week by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Fischer. The bill would restrict teen truckers from hauling hazardous materials or operating “special configurations,” which are generally defined as oversized or overweight loads. States and the U.S. Department of Transportation would also be allowed to impose other restrictions if they wish. States wouldn't be obligated to join the compacts, but Gillan said she expects state officials would be under pressure from the trucking industry to do so. To obtain an interstate commercial driver's license, drivers must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test administered by a state motor vehicles department. But there is no requirement that drivers first receive on the road training or attend a training school, Gillan said. Labor unions have said the driver shortage could be eliminated by raising truckers' wages and improving working conditions. A decade ago the Bush administration looked at lowering the commercial truck driving age to 18, but ultimately decided against doing that because the public comments the government received were overwhelmingly against the idea.

    "DiffbotBody": "Women are underrepresented and underpaid in virtually every sector of the arts. Art created predominantly by white men continues to fill museums and galleries, while films with male directors, producers, and lead roles continue to dominate box offices and award shows. The case is no different for the stage. “It’s just much harder for women to get recognition as playwrights and to get their work read and published as it is for men,” says Alicia Stanley, co-founder of Cohesion Theatre Company. Stanley and Cohesion co-founder Brad Norris are discussing gender imbalance in the arts, attempting to speak over sirens and the squabbles of fellow Highlandtowners outside of Filippo’s Pizzeria on South Conkling Street. Norris and Stanley met while working together on a production of “Edward II” at Spotlighters Theatre last year, and shortly after co-founded Cohesion Theatre Company in an effort to engage with other theater companies and artists of different disciplines—hence the name “Cohesion.” Last week, as the third and final play of its inaugural season, Cohesion opened its co-production of “The Pillow Book” by Baltimore-native playwright Anna Moench with the Strand Theater Company. Now, the company has organized a nearly six-week-long, citywide reading festival called ParityFest, highlighting underproduced, female-authored plays. At venues all over the city, Baltimore theater companies—as well as a few coming in from Washington, D.C.—will perform theatrical readings at varied levels of production Wednesdays through Sundays until Aug. 9. All the readings are pay-what-you-can and on Sundays, they include panel discussions or other educational programming on women in theater and beyond. Among the 22 participating companies are Single Carrot Theatre, Annex Theater, the Arena Players, Fells Point Corner Theatre, Baltimore Improv Group, EMP Collective, Stillpointe Theatre, and Interrobang Theatre, hosting performances at theater spaces, multipurpose venues such as the Station North Chicken Box and the Ynot Lot, and eateries including Joe Squared and Dangerously Delicious Pies. “The range of size of theater companies is great because we can show how many different people band together to say ‘this is important,’” says Stanley, “and the response from venues was way more than I ever anticipated—people who were willing to donate their space for free and work it for free because they cared about this issue. I was not prepared and we actually now have more venues than we know what to do with.” The plays selected for reading at the festival were sourced from “The List,” a catalog of recommended, underproduced plays from “female and trans*” playwrights compiled by the Kilroys, a Los Angeles-based volunteer collective of theater professionals devoted to promoting gender parity in theater. Norris and Stanley had been communicating with the Kilroys in planning ParityFest, as the group finalized their new 2015 list, which was created by surveying 321 theater professionals who had seen at least 40 new plays in the last year. Each person surveyed recommended three to five plays. The 53 most-recommended plays made it on the list, while 186 less-frequently-recommended plays are featured as honorable mentions. The 2014 and 2015 lists include works penned by renowned playwrights such as Paula Vogel and Lynn Nottage, whose “Ruined” Everyman Theatre staged earlier this season, as well as lesser-known authors like Moench. Most of the plays on ParityFest’s program were chosen from the 2015 list, which was just released on June 21 after multiple delays, while the rest were selected from the Kilroys’ first list released in 2014. Stanley and Norris say that they wanted to build on the momentum of the 2015 list in order to make it immediately relevant to the community, even though waiting for the list meant that the companies would not have their scripts until shortly before the festival kicks off on July 1. ParityFest comes at a time when Washington, D.C., and regional theater companies are preparing for the Women’s Voices Theatre Festival in the fall, while Baltimore companies are addressing parity and gender issues in recent and upcoming productions, such as an all-female cast production of “Henry IV, Part One” (which Stanley is performing in as well as music directing) at the Baltimore Shakespeare Factory at the end of July and a current stage adaptation of Gertrude Stein’s children’s novella “The World Is Round” co-produced by the Annex Theater and the Acme Corporation (see page 30). Center Stage and Single Carrot Theatre recently announced upcoming seasons that feature at least 50 percent female-authored plays, plus Center Stage’s all-female-cast production of Shakespeare’s “As You Like It.” Everyman Theatre will run its “Women’s Voices in Current and Future American Classics” salon reading series next season (although it’s basically a supplement to its entirely male-authored 2015-2016 program). Norris attributes this recent shift, in part, to the impact made on the national theater community by the Kilroys. Following the release of the 2014 list, more than 47 productions of the 46 plays listed were mounted or announced. Norris explains that in the theater industry, the most common excuse companies use for producing works by predominantly male playwrights is that it is difficult to find many reputable female-authored plays. The list is the Kilroys’ solution to eliminate that excuse. However, programming is not the only area in the industry that fails to represent genders equally. “A lot of plays have significantly more roles for men than women,” says Stanley. “It’s particularly a problem in classical plays, which are held up as what our theater is based on, so people are very hesitant to cross gender paths. There’s significantly more and significantly better roles for men. And [the lack of] female directors is another huge thing.” “There’s a ridiculous amount of women who are stage managers, technicians, marketing, development,” Norris says. “If you took a snapshot of sort of a general regional theater in America you would probably find that 80 percent of the staff working in the building of the theater, making the theater happen, are women. Mostly men are at the top rungs: artistic director, managing director. And then what is being produced on stages, generally speaking, is male-directed, male-authored, and mostly male-acted work.” Norris adds that male artistic producers often assume that the female voice in theater is limited, essentially, to female-centric works such as “The Vagina Monologues.” The list provides a variety of genres, from comedies to dramas, and subject matter, such as commentaries on race, as well as women’s issues. “The truth of the matter is, not every woman is writing about her vagina every single day,” says Norris. “Sometimes female-authored plays are just plays that happen to have female authors,” says Stanley, “which is one of the great things about the Kilroys’ “List”—it has enough plays to provide a broad spectrum of what a female voice means.” ParityFest will take place at various venues and at various times on Wednesdays Through Sundays from July 1 to Aug. 9.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting of the governing council of NITI Aayog, which has chief ministers and key cabinet ministers as members, to discuss the contentious land acquisition bill on July 15. This will be the second meeting of the policy-making body of the Aayog. Modi sent out invitations to the CMs recently for the meeting to be held at his residence at 7, Race Course Road residence. West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who has been consistently opposing the bill in its present form, wrote to the PM on Friday expressing her inability to attend the meet due to prior engagements in the state ahead of her departure for London. But the Trinamool chief spelt out her point of view in the letter and urged the PM to consider it as her views on the land bill. Banerjee is though upset about being unable to attend the meeting that will deal with such an important issue. Sources close to the CM said she felt it would have been better if the invitation for the meeting did not arrive at such a short notice. The meeting of CMs has been called at a time when the Modi government is keen to get the land bill cleared in the coming monsoon session of Parliament that begins from July 21. With Congress and major opposition parties vociferously opposed the bill, the Modi government is keen to take the CMs on board. The CMs of Congress-ruled states were reported to have supported the BJP government's amendments on the consent clause, scrapping of social impact assessment and provisions related to return of unutilised land, but they have had to toe the party-line and later opposed the changes. Apart from other reservations, Congress has pitched for a uniform four-time compensation to farmers as compared to the existing market value of the land to be acquired.

Now 31, he has been cast as a kind of brash hero of our cash-obsessed era on \"Million Dollar Listing San Francisco,\" Bravo's new reality show. It premiered Wednesday. If you watch, you will get to know him, fast: He's the one who refers to his two competitors -- agents Roh Habibi and Justin Fichelson -- as amateurs who were \"going to the prom\" when he was already a seasoned professional. In conversation, Greenwell -- based in Pleasanton, where he founded and runs Venture Sotheby's International Realty, which has 60 agents -- turns out to be less confrontational. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Andrew Greenwell, CEO and principal of Venture Sotheby's International Realty, is photographed July 8, 2015, in San Francisco. Greenwell is one of three Bay Area real estate agents who star in the San Francisco edition of Bravo's \"Million Dollar Listing\" reality show. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) Q Are you surprised to find yourself on this new show? It presents you and your two competitors as if you were pop culture icons. A I don't know if I'd call myself that. I'm just a real estate agent with a camera following me around. Q Tell me about the drama of the deal. Why does it translate to TV? A When you're dealing with someone who has large assets, the emotions run raw and there are no rules. It's a no-rules game. It's one of the most stressful and crazy things about the business, but it's also what makes it exciting. You can get up in the morning and close a deal by noon, but you can also totally lose that deal by noon. Q On the show, you come across as unusually competitive. A You have to be. This is a high-stakes game. There's no messing around. Q Is the show already bringing you new business? A Yeah, I think it's really going to ramp up. People come through an open house and the cameras are there -- it adds a little extra level of desire for them. People want to feel close to the show, close to the brokers. Q Do you feel any remorse over being someone who helps drive this crazy real estate market? The region is becoming unaffordable for most people. A I don't think that brokers and Realtors encourage the crazy market. We simply facilitate transactions. I think one of the things that differentiates me is that I have a business background. My brokerage will do close to $500 million in sales this year, but I actually don't like crazy markets. It's not healthy. You can't sustain it. I have not enjoyed the markets of the last few years in the city and it's actually been slowing down and that brings me great joy. null FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT Andrew greenwell 1 He married Paal Salvesen in April; they celebrated for a week with 40 guests on a 330-foot yacht in the Caribbean. 2 In December, he and Salvesen will travel to Cambodia and visit a rescue, rehabilitation and employment center for survivors of sex trafficking.

You can get up in the morning and close a deal by noon, but you can also totally lose that deal by noon. Q On the show, you come across as unusually competitive. A You have to be. This is a high-stakes game. There's no messing around. Q Is the show already bringing you new business? A Yeah, I think it's really going to ramp up. People come through an open house and the cameras are there -- it adds a little extra level of desire for them. People want to feel close to the show, close to the brokers. Q Do you feel any remorse over being someone who helps drive this crazy real estate market? The region is becoming unaffordable for most people. A I don't think that brokers and Realtors encourage the crazy market. We simply facilitate transactions. I think one of the things that differentiates me is that I have a business background. My brokerage will do close to $500 million in sales this year, but I actually don't like crazy markets. It's not healthy. You can't sustain it. I have not enjoyed the markets of the last few years in the city and it's actually been slowing down and that brings me great joy.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Grudge match: Daly Cherry-Evans will face off against the club he turned his back on on Monday night. Photo: Cameron Spencer Daly Cherry-Evans can take the first step in justifying his $10 million price tag when he faces the club he reneged on at Cbus Stadium. For the first time since his contract saga was resolved definitively, Cherry-Evans will take on the Gold Coast on Monday night. The Manly halfback signed a \"lifetime\" contract to remain on the northern beaches, although inking the biggest contract in rugby league history didn't stop him from being axed by the Maroons. Fox Sports is hoping the fixture will be a ratings winner given the firestorm over the 26-year-old's decision to take advantage of the contentious round-13 clause, which has subsequently been scrapped. However, the Monday night timeslot will likely result in a modest crowd, although it could well be a vocal one given the reception \"DCE\" received in Brisbane following his announcement. The Titans have decided not to stir up anti-DCE sentiment in the build up, missing an opportunity to market and promote the clash. However, the league fraternity will watch with interest to see if Titans players look for retribution - and how Cherry-Evans handles the occasion. \"I don't really know, to be honest,\" Gold Coast CEO Graham Annesley said when asked about the likely crowd reaction. \"I can only gauge it from when Manly played Brisbane a few weeks ago. There was some lighthearted crowd involvement and there may well be some more of that, but nothing we're motivating as a club. \"If it motivates people to come to the game, then I will be very happy about that. As long as they behave themselves and do the right thing they can see him play and see how we go against him. That's great for us, we'll gladly accept them.\" Cherry-Evans bought a $1.45 million property in Mermaid Waters in what many believed was a pointer he would honour his commitment to the Titans. While he changed his mind, the Redcliffe product wasn't able to backflip on the four-bedroom house, which settled just days before confirming his Sea Eagles deal. However, he won't be able to stay in it over the weekend, as the tenants are committed for the foreseeable future. The Titans have yet to find a replacement for Cherry-Evans, missing out on Trent Hodkinson and a number of other key targets. They are pursuing boom Brisbane No.7 Ashley Taylor but they could again be thwarted by the Sea Eagles, who are tabling an offer of their own. Out-of-favour Newcastle halfback Tyrone Roberts could be a fallback option for a club still recovering from the DCE debacle. Asked if there was still animosity towards Cherry-Evans, a diplomatic Annesley said: \"Not any longer. Obviously it was disappointing at the time when it happened but we have moved on very quickly. [Coach] Neil Henry was looking at his other options that very same afternoon. \"Coaches don't sit around dwelling on these things, nor do I or the board. It's happened, we need to prepare our roster for next season and try to compete well for the remainder of this season. \"We haven't sat around crying in our Weet-Bix about it.\" The former NSW Minister for Sport said the club would not rush into finding a replacement playmaker to partner Kane Elgey. \"There are a number of options explored already,\" he said. \"I'm not suggesting we've made offers on others at this stage but we won't rush into it. We want to get the right person at the right fit for our club going forward. If that takes a bit more time, so be it.\" Manly utility forward Ligi Sao will return to his hometown and rejoin the Warriors for the next two NRL seasons. Sao, 23, moved to Manly in 2013 and has made 16 first-grade appearances for the Sea Eagles, 15 of them this season. Warriors coach Andrew McFadden says Sao will add depth to the club and increase competition for spots. Sao, who played for the Junior Warriors, including in their 2001 grand final win, said returning to Auckland was a key factor in his decision. He will get an early introduction to his future teammates when he runs out at lock against the Warriors at Mt Smart Stadium on Saturday. Sao had been in danger of missing the match after being charged with a dangerous throw on North Queensland's Michael Morgan. But at the NRL judiciary on Wednesday night, he was found not guilty over the incident in the Sea Eagles' 30-12 loss to the Cowboys on Monday night. The Warriors have already signed Roosters star fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Rabbitohs hooker Issac Luke. Sao's move to the Warriors came as reports emerged of the club's desire to sack players en masse, with up to 14 Sea Eagles said to be in the firing line. Manly coach Geoff Toovey says he knows nothing of the rumours. AAP",

When: 5 to 7 p.m. July 16 Where: Boulder Municipal Building, 1777 Broadway Parking in Boulder, and specifically downtown, can be tough. But those who live near some of the city's most trafficked areas have petitioned for expanded restrictions on drivers visiting residential areas. The city will host an open house next week to inform the public of proposed changes to parking in three neighborhoods — West Pearl, Whittier and Mapleton — as well as a new proposed zone in east Boulder. The changes were requested by Boulder residents who gathered signatures from neighbors and brought forth petitions requesting extra protection in the form of two- and three-hour parking limits on streets that have been free in the past. Next week's event, from 5 to 7 p.m. July 16 at the Municipal Building at Broadway and Canyon Boulevard, will introduce expansions of Neighborhood Parking Permit programs that would require affected residents to pay $17 a year for a permit exempting them from being ticketed for leaving cars in certain areas. The proposed changes affect Pearl Street between Third and Fourth streets (Fourth through Eighth streets are already protected along Pearl), Seventh through Ninth streets along Mapleton Avenue, and Mapleton between 20th and 21st streets. Additionally, the city is considering a petition that would require permits north of East Aurora Avenue between 35th and 37th streets. Detailed maps of affected areas are available online. Molly Winter, director of Downtown and University Hill Management Division and Parking Services, said the city is doing its best to meet the growing needs of a multi-modal, commuting population. \"If you are expecting a bustling urban environment, there's going to be more demand than, say, other kinds of commercial strip centers,\" Winter said. \"We're balancing a lot of different needs.\" The Neighborhood Parking Permit program, adopted in the mid-1990s, prioritizes what Winter calls \"neighborhood livability.\" \"In these areas that are adjacent to traffic generators, like the downtown, high schools and near the university ... it is first and foremost about that,\" she added. \"But there's a lot of variety in people's needs, and the key thing is to provide accessibility to our centers. So, it's a constant balancing of all these different modes and all of these different folks' needs.\" The streets just north of Chautauqua, one of the city's most heavily trafficked areas, may be next in line for expanded parking regulations. Winter said her staff is in talks with residents who live off of Baseline near Chautauqua and are seeking additional protection from the city. Winter did not specify which streets in that area could see changes. \"The neighbors' perspective there,\" she said, \"is that (parking issues) have a lot to do with visitors coming up to that area. ...

    "DiffbotBody": "I WAS SPEAKING with someone on the phone the other day. In the middle of our conversation he began to exclaim about the size of the woodchuck he could see from his front door and lament that he was “not allowed to shoot them.” Despite his wife and I having the same feeling about shooting animals whose territory we basically usurped, I can understand why many people think of woodchucks as “varmints” and would shoot one without second thought. The woodchuck can be seen pretty much everywhere, especially along the highway. My husband and I had been together maybe a year when we decided to take a vacation from our then home in Allentown, Pa., to his family camp in the Shenandoah Mountains of West Virginia. My 100-pound shepherd/husky and our little white cat we had fondly named Cheesemold took up the entire back seat. Our luggage, such as it was, went on the roof. Along long stretches of highway I would constantly say “woodchuck!” as we passed one pudgy rodent after another munching tender greens along the roadside. After each one, my (human) traveling companion would say “What woodchuck? I didn’t see it.” Then, probably over the West Virginia line, we passed a vehicle parked in the weeds along the roadway with a giant plastic horse painted purple sitting on top of it. Perhaps five miles and likely several woodchuck pronouncements later, my husband says, “I suppose now you are going to tell me you saw a purple horse on top of a car a few miles back.” We have chuckled about that drive for 30 years (which included a flat tire). And for 30 years I still say “woodchuck!” at the many roadside grazers I see everywhere here in New Hampshire. I am happy to report that I rarely, if ever, have seen a roadkill woodchuck. Woodchucks are also known as groundhogs and despite their bad rap, they do have their oddly celebrated day in February when Punxsutawney, Pa., and now several other towns drag one out of hibernation to predict the weather and wonder why the darn thing bit someone as the media gathered ’round.They are also known as whistle pigs — I assume because they whistle (do they?) — but searching “whistle pig” online only brings up site after site about a brand of straight rye whiskey. Perhaps it’s not the groundhog doing the whistling. One factoid that surprised me that I found on the Woodchucks Wildlife Damage Management Fact Sheet Series from Cornell Cooperative Extension (copyright 2001) and was corroborated by several other websites is that the woodchuck is “one of the largest members of the squirrel family.” Who knew?Woodchucks, like their squirrel cousins, are apparently highly adaptable. Once not as common as they are today, they actually thrive amidst all the tree-clearing that states like ours have done over the past decades. The woodchucks quickly moved into the small amount of acreage we cleared here at our farm. I used to plug up their holes with large rocks or stumps so the horses wouldn’t break a leg in one. But I quickly found that that just meant more holes as the woodchuck dug a new secondary entrance/exit. So now I just poke a metal fence post in them so the woodchuck can still use it and the horses can avoid the fence post and therefore the hole. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. Another thing I didn’t know that the Cornell fact sheet points out is that woodchucks “are excellent climbers.” Woodchucks are not protected in New York, where Cornell is located. In New Hampshire, woodchucks can be shot at any time of the year, however, according to the UNH Cooperative Extension bulletin “Dealing with Woodchuck Damage,” only by licensed hunters or farmers on their own property (which does not include backyard gardeners unless they are licensed hunters). And that said, you should read the entire Cornell fact sheet (wildlifecontrol.info/pubs/Documents/Woodchucks_factsheet.pdf) because if you are thinking about control of any kind, you might want to think again and put your time to better use. First, even if you can shoot a woodchuck the fact that a lot of woodchuck nuisance problems happen near homes may eliminate the legality of shooting them, not because of the animal but because of the proximity to houses. But even more importantly, the Cornell bulletin says, neither lethal nor nonlethal controls are found to have much success. A study in Pennsylvania removed 1,040 woodchucks from a 600-acre site over the course of four years without any significant impact on the population. They tend to respond by increasing their birth rate, showing a higher rate of juvenile survival, and other woodchucks move in from outside the area. Seems like it might be better to spend your time and ammunition money planting extra of the woodchucks’ favorites such as beans, peas, carrots, broccoli and tomatoes. Or use the best method found of all — electric fence around your garden. Woodchucks, says the UNH Cooperative Extension bulletin, are an important part of the natural environment and provide den sites for many other animals. The bulletin puts it best: Woodchucks “in your yard can be enjoyable. They are part of the natural world that is shrinking at our expense. Enjoy them!” Cheryl Kimball is a freelance writer who lives north of Rochester.

Another thing I didn’t know that the Cornell fact sheet points out is that woodchucks “are excellent climbers.” Woodchucks are not protected in New York, where Cornell is located. In New Hampshire, woodchucks can be shot at any time of the year, however, according to the UNH Cooperative Extension bulletin “Dealing with Woodchuck Damage,” only by licensed hunters or farmers on their own property (which does not include backyard gardeners unless they are licensed hunters). And that said, you should read the entire Cornell fact sheet (wildlifecontrol.info/pubs/Documents/Woodchucks_factsheet.pdf) because if you are thinking about control of any kind, you might want to think again and put your time to better use. First, even if you can shoot a woodchuck the fact that a lot of woodchuck nuisance problems happen near homes may eliminate the legality of shooting them, not because of the animal but because of the proximity to houses.But even more importantly, the Cornell bulletin says, neither lethal nor nonlethal controls are found to have much success. A study in Pennsylvania removed 1,040 woodchucks from a 600-acre site over the course of four years without any significant impact on the population. They tend to respond by increasing their birth rate, showing a higher rate of juvenile survival, and other woodchucks move in from outside the area. Seems like it might be better to spend your time and ammunition money planting extra of the woodchucks’ favorites such as beans, peas, carrots, broccoli and tomatoes. Or use the best method found of all — electric fence around your garden.Woodchucks, says the UNH Cooperative Extension bulletin, are an important part of the natural environment and provide den sites for many other animals. The bulletin puts it best: Woodchucks “in your yard can be enjoyable. They are part of the natural world that is shrinking at our expense. Enjoy them!”Cheryl Kimball is a freelance writer who lives north of Rochester. You can email her at naturetalksck@gmail.com.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The album is the guitarist's first for over 20 years Keith Richards has announced a new solo album, Crosseyed Heart. The album – the Rolling Stones guitarist’s first release under his own name since 1992’s Main Offender – is released on September 18 on EMI, and is reportedly inspired by “reggae, rock, country and the blues”. In a press release, Richards says: “I had a ball making this new record and working with [drummer] Steve Jordan and [guitarist] Waddy Wachtel again. There’s nothing like walking into a studio and having absolutely no idea what you’re going to come out with on the other end.” Crosseyed Heart is Richards’ third solo album, following Main Offender and 1988’s Talk Is Cheap. Wachtel and Jordan have appeared on all the guitarist’s solo work. The new album features a number of other musicians, including saxophone from Bobby Keys, recorded before he died in December 2014.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s time to boycott sanctuary cities because they are not safe. This is not like left-wing boycotts that aim to intimidate us into political correctness. This is about public safety. Local officials should obey the laws that require simple cooperation with immigration authorities. Cities receive millions of federal dollars that supposedly are conditioned on that cooperation. No public safety? Then no conventions or tourism. No law enforcement? Then no federal dollars for make-believe policing. Where laws are ignored, people are not safe. We witnessed that with the murder of Kate Steinle, evidently killed by a five-time Mexican deportee and seven-time felon who kept returning to San Francisco because he knew the city would let him stay. Steinle’s is not the only such story. Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa Republican) has documented 121 murders related to illegal aliens set free by President Obama’s policies since 2010. Illegal immigrants accounted for three-fourths of all federal drug convictions last year and are one-third of all federal incarcerations, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Yet more than 200 cities in 32 states provide sanctuary for illegal immigrants. No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers for personal protection. Those locales grant blanket immunity, accepting the fiction that all illegal immigrants are peaceful and law-abiding. That is no more true of foreign nationals than it is of native-born Americans. Jeb Bush’s description of illegal immigration as an “act of love” is like pretending that every marriage is happy and that abuse does not exist. This is not to accuse all illegal aliens of breaking additional laws. But immigration laws have a purpose: They are designed to screen out criminals, miscreants and people who will “become a charge upon the public,” meaning dependence on public assistance. When those laws are not enforced, the screening process disappears. Sanctuary cities undermine public safety by refusing to distinguish between who is dangerous and who is not. Inquiries about behavior or life history are considered taboo. All of America pays a heavy price when public officials refuse to be law-abiding. Why should anybody else obey laws they dislike when leaders won’t? There should be no sanctuary for public officials who disregard our laws. Their cities rely on the rest of us for tourism, conventions, sports fans and other revenue. Top sanctuary cities include New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago, Houston and Denver. These are among the 200-plus listed at several places online, such as the map from the Center for Immigration Studies. Official statistics are not kept on crimes committed by illegal aliens; those would be too politically embarrassing. But liberals constantly tell us, “If it saves just one life, then it’s worth it.” Examples of lost lives are plentiful. In addition to Kate Steinle, other recent victims include Oklahoma City TV sportscaster Bob Barry Jr., who died in June. Police say Mr. Barry was killed when Gustavo Gutierrez made an illegal U-turn. It was a huge U-turn: Gutierrez had been sent back to Mexico three times but always came back. Reports show Gutierrez had no drivers’ license but did have cocaine on him. The Federation for American Immigration Reform cites other recent examples on its website, including these: July 2015— Ever Olivos-Gutierrez, an illegal visa overstayer, was convicted of second degree murder in Colorado for the death he caused while driving intoxicated. It was the fourth time since 2000 he had been arrested for DUI May 2015— A Salvadoran, Julio C. Saravia, sentenced in Virginia to 29 years in prison for rape of a minor May 2015— Zeng Liang Chen and Dong Biao Lin, illegal aliens from China, were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in New Jersey April 2015— Sergio Quezada Lopez, a Mexican illegal alien who had been deported four times, was sentenced in Oregon to 15 years in prison for a heroin overdose death. His brother, Gerardo Chalke Lopez, also a previously deported alien, was give 18 years on the same charges. Communities should reassure businesses, tourists, convention-goers and others by demonstrating their commitment to public safety. They could certify: “This city cooperates with federal authorities in enforcing all national laws, including immigration laws.” That could be posted on placards like those displayed by many retailers, warning that they cooperate with the local district attorney to enforce laws against hot checks. Several in Congress are proposing new consequences for sanctuary cities. But can they succeed against liberal opposition in the U.S. Senate, plus a potential veto by President Obama? Fortunately, public boycotts of sanctuary cities cannot be vetoed by politicians. Conservatives and all reasonable people should not act like liberals and use boycotts for cheap symbolism or to impose political correctness. Nothing like the efforts to keep the Super Bowl out of Arizona, halt the Final Four in Indianapolis, haul down Confederate flags or to shut down Chick-fil-A stores. But insisting that cities protect us by simply obeying the law is not symbolism; it is public safety. Every community that declares itself lawless becomes a clear and present danger to those who live, work or visit there. • Ernest Istook is a former U.S. congressman from Oklahoma.

After the state Medical Examiner's Office completes an autopsy, officials will determine if Maille's alleged attacker, Robert Girard, 24, of Lowell, will face more serious charges in connection with the June 26 assault, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said. Girard is currently being held without bail on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault after his June 26 arraignment in Lowell District Court. The judge ordered Girard undergo an examination at the jail for psychiatric issues. Craig Maille was badly injured in a fight on Thursday. His sister Melissa, who was wounded several months ago, is now organizing a vigil. (COURTESY PHOTO) Girard's next court date is July 29, but with Maille's death, Girard may be facing upgraded charges, according to the DA's office. One day before the assault on Maille, Girard was charged with assault and battery on a public employee for allegedly taking a swing at a detention attendant at the Lowell Police Station. According to court documents, Girard was under arrest on June 25 for an undisclosed crime, when he began putting toilet paper on the lens of the mounted camera in his cell to obstruct the attendant's view. When attendant Shawn Tetreault told Girard to step away from his cell door, Girard began yelling obscenities and refused to move. The officer entered the cell, Girard allegedly swung at Tetreault and tried to push him backward. When officers tried to grab his arms, Girard swung his arms to break free. Girard was subdued after he fell to the floor. He was released on $1,000 cash bail at his arraignment on June 26 in Lowell District Court . Hours later, Lowell police were dispatched to a fight at the Pace Gas station at the corner of Lakeview Street and Aiken Ave. All the parties had driven off. Lowell police secure the scene on West Sixth Street after the driver of the pickup truck at center, a 42-year-old city man, suffered a seizure following a fight with another man in the parking lot of the Pace gas station at the intersection of Lakeview Avenue and Aiken Street. SUN / AMELIA PAK-HARVEY Sun staff photos can be ordered by visiting our SmugMug site. In court documents, Makayla Rosado, a passenger in Maille's truck, told police she and Maille went to the gas station to meet a man she knows as \"G-money Girard\" to talk to him about a dog stolen the night before in Dracut. Another passenger in the truck was Christopher Sanchez, 17, of Lowell. Lowell police learned that two days earlier, Dracut police responded to a Barker Avenue address for a reported house break. Some electronics and a Yorkshire terrier puppy were stolen. Police suspected Girard and his friend, Sanchez, may have been involved. Sanchez told Lowell police that he and Girard were involved in an incident in Dracut the night before. Girard was angry with Sanchez because he believed Sanchez cooperated with the police, according to court documents. Security video from the gas station shows the fight between Girard, Maille and Sanchez, according to court documents. The video shows Girard exiting his Ford Mustang and approaching Maille's pickup truck. Girard opens the rear door of the truck and tries to hit Sanchez, a passenger in the truck, but Girard misses and begins chasing Sanchez around the truck. As Maille gets out and tries to intervene, Girard begins punching him in the head until Maille holds Girard in a bear hug. The fight ends and the two vehicles leave. While driving on West Sixth Street, Maille appeared to have a seizure, Rosado tells police. She reached over to step on the brake to stop the truck. An ambulance is called. When emergency personnel arrived, Maille was having a massive heart attack, documents state. Maille's pulse was weak and paramedics started CPR while he is transported to Lowell General Hospital, where he died on Thursday. After Girard was arrested, he admitted he punched Maille several times but claimed it was self defense. Maille had been planning a candlelight vigil on June 30 to bring attention to the recent violence in the Centralville neighborhood, where he grew up. As he lay in the hospital fighting for his life, his sister Melissa Maille, who was hit by gunfire as she lay sleeping in her bed on March 1, picked up the torch and organized the vigil.

As he lay in the hospital fighting for his life, his sister Melissa Maille, who was hit by gunfire as she lay sleeping in her bed on March 1, picked up the torch and organized the vigil.

    "DiffbotBody": "Washington's NFL team already knows what its next move is to protect its trademark: appeal to a higher court. But what it's doing and what it should be doing, according to at least one crisis communications expert, may be at odds. Daniel G. Hill, president of Ervin-Hill Strategy in D.C., said his advice to the team and owner Dan Snyder is to \"rip off the Band-Aid'' after U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of the Washington NFL team's federal trademark registrations. \"The team is in a difficult spot,'' said Hill. \"At some point, they are going to have to stop fighting it. The problem with these kinds of issues, race issues and things like that, is you can have great facts on your side. Dan Snyder can do polls of Native Americans and others who support the current name, but you only have to offend a small group for it not to work.'' Ervin-Hill, in the crisis communications side of its public relations business, works with athletes and sports teams, among others, when tricky situations arise. Hill wouldn't name specific clients on the crisis side for confidentiality reasons; Ervin-Hill also works with athletes through the company's Pro Impact service, which consults and advises on image branding (professional boxer Heather \"the Heat\" Hardy is one Pro Impact client). Hill said Washington's NFL team will likely eventually be forced — for financial or other reasons — to change the team's nickname and Hill doesn't see the social pressure letting up any time soon, even as the team has vowed to forge ahead in the court system, and its next step is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. How would Hill handle it? \"The way I like to tackle these things is if I know eventually I have to do something, I do it more immediately, even if it doesn’t fit with what I want or what my client wants,'' said Hill. \"If they eventually have to change the name they should get it out of the way. This is sports; you’re not going to lose your fans. The Wizards are as popular today as they were when they were the Bullets. \"[The team] is treating this like a mundane legal matter. Arguing the name is historic doesn't really do anything in light of what's happening in the country. The name has color and 'skin' in it. And those two things, right now more than ever in the last 50 years, we need to get away from. Them fighting it at this particular moment makes absolutely no sense.\" If the team continues to fight, via the appeals process — the case would be heard by a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit. and it must file within 30 days of Wednesday's ruling — it will be a lengthy battle. Jesse A. Witten, the lead attorney for the Native Americans fighting the trademark fighting the team over the team’s trademark protections, said the appeals process could take 18 months \"plus or minus a few months\" to play out. If the team loses and wants to appeal, it would have to go to the Supreme Court, which picks and chooses the cases it hears.",

But since they’ve made it clear that they aren’t ready to work on whatever is keeping them apart, Cole has managed to find herself in an even worse situationship with Bryan “Birdman” Williams since her marriage started falling apart. She went from fighting other women for him, to grinding on pianos on Instagram for the 45-year-old record producer and entrepreneur. In both cases, I think Cole thought she had found individuals who actually understood her and would treat her right, but alas, people aren’t always what they seem. So now that she’s had time to process some of her decisions when it comes to her relationships, she’s making some changes. She’s allowed her mother, Frankie, and her siblings, including sisters Neffeteria and Elite, back in her life after not being on the best of terms. She’s also going about dating in a different way. According to Cole, she’s going to abstain from sex. It’s unclear for how long, but she seems ready and willing to wait after all her heart has been through: Can you relate to Cole’s decision?

    "DiffbotBody": "With the majority of head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad back in pre-season training, preparations for Tottenham Hotspur's 2014-15 campaign are well underway. For supporters, glimpses of the team's sessions on social media are better than nothing after a month away. But the opportunity to actually see their team in action—players new and old working together for the first time—that is when things begin to feel real again. Over the following pages Bleacher Report looks at Tottenham's announced opponents for this summer's friendlies. We begin with the League One outfit hosting a Spurs XI side (likely consisting of development squad talent and any auxiliary players Pochettino needs to run the rule over), right up to the big-name opposition the first team will face just days prior to the Premier League season opener. Pre-season only tells us so much, but they are nonetheless fascinating steps toward the proper action beginning. Begin Slideshow » Tottenham's first opponents of the summer, Peterborough United, got their pre-season off to a winning start this past week with a 3-2 win over Dulwich Hamlet. On the scoresheet was striker Joe Gormley, signed in June after netting 40 goals for Northern Irish side Cliftonville last season. The 26-year-old's scoring exploits saw him mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by UEFA.com's Darren Fullerton in the spring. Now Peterborough manager Dave Robertson is hoping Gormley can help fire his team out of League One. \"I'm over the moon, he's a fantastic signing for us,\" Robertson told The Posh TV. \"We know that Joe is going to bring goals to the team next season.\" Ninth in England's third tier last season, Posh have also added former West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison to a squad that includes former Spurs goalkeeper Ben Alnwick. The new blood, coupled with last season's experience, has suitably raised expectations. \"Anything but promotion is failure in my eyes,\" defender Michael Smith admitted to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, per BBC Sport. With a game against West Ham already under their belts by then, Peterborough should be in shape to provide Spurs a decent examination of their burgeoning fitness levels. After 2014's three-match North American tour, Tottenham make a briefer visit to the States this year as they participate in the MLS All-Star Game. The eighth English club to be invited to take on the league's best since the old East vs. West All-Star format was abandoned, Spurs follow Bayern Munich who were defeated 2-1 in last year's match. Preferring to keep most of his team's preparations closer to home, the fixture is Pochettino's one pre-season concession to the now-routine activity of Premier League clubs heading overseas to further their global brand. Despite being a primarily commercial exercise, Spurs should find an exacting on-pitch challenge in the form of an MLS select group attempting to again demonstrate their ability against one of European football's famous old names. The still-to-be-confirmed team could well feature former Spurs striker Robbie Keane, in his fifth year with the division's reigning champions Los Angeles Galaxy. For several of Pochettino's team, it will be their first opportunity to get some important minutes in their legs ahead of the Premier League season. Those not making the trip to Colorado will be heading to Hertfordshire as Spurs open August away at . A frequent pre-season opponent over the years, Stevenage's Lamex Stadium also hosts the club's under-21 fixtures that don't take place at the training ground or White Hart Lane. This latest meeting carries extra intrigue in that it is one of the first games for recently installed Stevenage boss and Spurs Hall of Fame inductee Teddy Sheringham. \"The aim is to do better than last season,\" said Sheringham to his new club's official website following his appointment, while understanding that will be difficult given they reached the League Two play-off semi-final. The existing Spurs links at the club did not escape him either. \"I know a few of the boys, the likes of Chris Day were at Tottenham, I think Charlie Lee might have kicked me once or twice when he was coming through the ranks. I know Ronnie Henry too.\" Defender Mark Hughes, midfielder Steven Schumacher and centre-forward Brett Williams have all been drafted in to join those already there. Sheringham told the club's website he intends \"to bring in two or three more players at least\" but also stated \"I like what I have got now, the base of what we have looks really good.\" The Boro first team plays Wealdstone in its first friendly this weekend before visiting St Neots Town next week. Prior to taking on Tottenham in the final warm-up before the season begins, Sheringham's squad will take on another two of his old clubs, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, , have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him. Indeed, the Mirror's Liam Corless reports Real fans were chanting not-so-secret target David De Gea's name during the unveiling of the aforementioned signing from Porto. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid, Tottenham will have one more match in Munich the following day. They will face either or hosts Bayern in either the third/fourth play-off or final. Last season's 10th-place finish in Serie A has prompted change on and off the pitch at Milan. Pippo Inzaghi has been replaced with Sampdoria boss Sinisa Mihajlovic in the San Siro hot seat (almost as toasty as that found at the Bernabeu). Luiz Adriano and Carlos Bacca formerly of Shakhtar Donetsk and Sevilla, respectively, have been brought in to bolster the team's flagging attack. From within Italian borders they have drafted in Andrea Bertolacci and Luca Antonelli to try and improve things in midfield and defence. The Rossoneri would kill for the kind of season Bayern Munich had. Despite a dominant run to the Bundesliga title, the failure to win the Champions League has upped the pressure on Pep Guardiola. Bayern have been brilliant more often than not on his watch. Yet Guardiola's inability thus far to replicate the success enjoyed by the team in Jupp Heynckes' final season two years ago could count against him soon enough, no matter the difficulty of matching 2012-13's extraordinary treble. Should Spurs cross paths with Bayern in August, and depending on the circumstances, they could be witness to a fascinating atmosphere at the Allianz Arena. Iffy performances from the German side in their own tournament do not necessarily mean anything at such an early stage. But Guardiola and his team would prefer to launch their latest pursuit for glory and history in the most positive fashion possible.",
