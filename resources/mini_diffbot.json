    "text": "Survey a group at random and you might find quite a few people who speak a language other than your own. Spanish is common; French, Chinese, Minionese, Japanese, Hindi...\nHmm? Minionese, you say? What is this strange and exotic term?\nIt's a fully learnable language born of Illumination's Despicable Me, its sequel, and newest release Minions. That's right: The adorable, good-hearted, sometimes one-eyed creatures have their own dialect, and we are all invited to jump on that boat.\nJust don't forget your bananas.\nDuring a discussion with Entertainment Weekly, it was revealed that the movie's directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud invented Minionese themselves. Though it's \"more based on sounds and rhythms than the literal meanings of words,\" its rules are not far off from many dialects across the world. The Bantu languages of southern Africa, for example, are based on a series of short clicks.\nEven producer Chris Meledandri has worked with our yellow friends at such frequency that it's become second-nature.\nNow that I’ve lived so closely to the movie for so long, if somebody didn’t remind me that they weren’t speaking in plain English, I’d forget.\nTalk about dedication.\nCoffin wrote part of the language as a mixture of English, Spanish, French, Indian and Italian. Thus, many of the words are intuitive, or sound similar to their English brethren. \"Thank you,\" for example, is \"tank yu.\" \"Toy\" is \"baboi.\" You get the gist.\nThose interested in learning the language of the Minions are in luck. One enterprising YouTuber named Madison put together a lesson plan below.\nIf you do happen to get it down, sincere kudos.\nGru would be so proud.",
