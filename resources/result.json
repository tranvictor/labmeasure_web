Minionese, you say? What is this strange and exotic term? It's a fully learnable language born of Illumination's Despicable Me, its sequel, and newest release Minions. That's right: The adorable, good-hearted, sometimes one-eyed creatures have their own dialect, and we are all invited to jump on that boat. Just don't forget your bananas. During a discussion with Entertainment Weekly, it was revealed that the movie's directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud invented Minionese themselves. Though it's \"more based on sounds and rhythms than the literal meanings of words,\" its rules are not far off from many dialects across the world. The Bantu languages of southern Africa, for example, are based on a series of short clicks. Even producer Chris Meledandri has worked with our yellow friends at such frequency that it's become second-nature. Now that I\u2019ve lived so closely to the movie for so long, if somebody didn\u2019t remind me that they weren\u2019t speaking in plain English, I\u2019d forget. Talk about dedication. Coffin wrote part of the language as a mixture of English, Spanish, French, Indian and Italian. Thus, many of the words are intuitive, or sound similar to their English brethren. \"Thank you,\" for example, is \"tank yu.\" \"Toy\" is \"baboi.\" You get the gist. Those interested in learning the language of the Minions are in luck. One enterprising YouTuber named Madison put together a lesson plan below. If you do happen to get it down, sincere kudos. Gru would be so proud.",

After spending the day giving Hunger Games fans the latest scoop about the fan-favorite franchise, Jennifer Lawrence and her Mockingjay - Part 2 co-stars hit up Conan O'Brien's show. And because she's a queen who can't resist putting on a good show, Jennifer Lawrence ended up singing Cher's \"Believe.\" After Conan gave the Oscar-winner some light ribbing about the surprisingly popular remixed version of Mockingjay - Part 1's \"Hanging Tree,\" Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth cajoled Lawrence into belting out Cher's iconic hit. Hutcherson even joined in with some diva moves of his own. Check out the video below! JLaw also dropped f-bombs left and right during the appearance, and thanks to Conan's special swear jar ended up raising $10,000 for charity. Swearing is caring! And check out more Hunger Games Comic-Con fun below:",
