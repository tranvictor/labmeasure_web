    "DiffbotBody": "Judge halts curtailment of some senior water rights Water users’ lawyer cites lack of due process Ruling could have statewide implications In a significant ruling that could hinder California’s ability to order mass water cutbacks, a judge told state drought regulators Friday they can’t slash the water rights of four Central Valley irrigation districts until each had a chance to defend itself. A Sacramento Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the State Water Resources Control Board from enforcing a curtailment notice against the West Side Irrigation District, Central Delta Water Agency, South Delta Water Agency and Woods Irrigation Co. The judge said the four agencies, all primarily agricultural, weren’t given the chance to defend their rights in front of the water board. While the ruling by Judge Shelleyanne Chang affects only those four agencies, experts said the decision could have statewide implications. The case goes to the heart of what regulators say is a critical tool for allocating supplies in the fourth year of drought. Gov. Jerry Brown in April issued an executive order saying the board can “bring enforcement actions against illegal diverters and those engaging in the wasteful and unreasonable use of water.” Since then, the board has curtailed the rights of dozens of senior water rights holders in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys in a series of mass notices, telling them to stop diverting water from California’s rivers and streams. It is the first time since 1977 that the state has curtailed senior rights, those that existed before 1914, when the state formally set up its complex water rights system. Rights to more than 1.2 million acre-feet of water have been curtailed. Chang’s ruling could affect “everybody that received a curtailment order,” said Stuart Somach, a Sacramento water-law attorney not involved in the case. Beyond that, experts said the decision could grind the state’s drought-management machinery to a halt as regulators are desperate to stretch dwindling supplies through the hot summer months. Instead of issuing curtailment notices to dozens of farmers and other water users en masse, as it has done in recent weeks, the state might have to hold hearings first to sort out their water rights. “It definitely shows that the legal process probably can’t respond as quickly as nature requires it to respond,” said Scott Shapiro, a water rights lawyer at the Downey Brand law firm in Sacramento who isn’t connected to the case. A lawyer for one of the plaintiffs said it’s crucial that water users have the ability to plead their case before the water board. “The court is sending the state board a message that the water users have been trying to send for a few months,” said Jennifer Spaletta, a lawyer for the Central Delta agency, which is based in Stockton and supplies water to 120,000 acres of land. “Water rights are complicated. They cannot send out these broad orders.” Water board officials maintained Friday that the ruling isn’t all that significant. Board staff counsel David Rose said the curtailment notices are “informational” in nature, intended to tell water users that supplies aren’t available to support their water rights. The board would hold a hearing before issuing any fines or taking other enforcement actions against diversions it considered unauthorized. “Before anyone is penalized or deprived of anything, there would be a process,” he said. As a result, the board doesn’t feel hobbled by the judge’s ruling, Rose said. “I don’t think, from the board’s perspective, there is a practical impact” from the judge’s ruling, he said. The judge, however, said the board’s curtailment notices have “coercive” language that goes beyond informational. The notices tell users to “immediately stop diverting water,” she said. Recipients of the notices have to go online within seven days and declare “under penalty of perjury that they are no longer diverting water,” she said. Other experts said the ruling presents a potentially major stumbling block for regulators. “This is very challenging” for the board, said Shapiro, whose firm represents north Delta farmers. “In order for the board to be able to curtail the water rights, it has to go through a more full process.” Somach, whose firm is representing a Delta-area water district pursuing its own lawsuit over curtailed rights, agreed. The state should have held “due process hearings to make sure there is no water available,” he said. “None of that stuff happened.” Close to a dozen water districts have sued the state in response to curtailment notices, arguing that the water board doesn’t have jurisdiction over pre-1914 rights. Chang didn’t address that issue. Rather, the judge’s five-page ruling took issue with the state board’s decision to curtail the four agencies’ water rights “without any sort of pre-deprivation hearing.” She ordered further court hearings on the matter July 30. However the court rules, the dispute highlights the urgent need to determine just how much water is being diverted and how much is actually available during certain times of year, said Jennifer Harder, who teaches water law at University of the Pacific’s McGeorge School of Law. Better data, she said, would allow regulators to make a stronger case when they issue a cutback order. Such studies are underway, but compounding the challenge for state regulators is that very few senior rights holders who pull water directly from streams and rivers precisely track and report how much they use.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "DURHAM Anonymity suited Grayson Allen. Unless he was with one of his instantly recognizable teammates, Allen could move quietly and quickly across Duke’s campus as a freshman, even as a member of the basketball team. He liked it that way. Despite his status as a high school basketball star and top recruit, he never sought attention. He preferred to move through the world as Grayson Allen, not Basketball Star Grayson Allen. That comfort zone is gone. It disappeared in April, evaporated instantly the moment he became an unlikely Final Four star. “I can kind of go under the radar, 6-foot-4, a pretty average-looking guy,” Allen said. He could go under the radar. “I could,” Allen acknowledged. “After that game, not so much anymore.” Grayson Allen hasn’t changed much, but the world around him has. It knows who he is now, and he’s constantly reminded of that fact. By the kids back home in Jacksonville, Fla., who stopped to point at him as he drove by. By the golf fans who spotted him walking through the galleries at The Players Championship and whispered his name loud enough for Allen to hear. By the pair of young girls stopping him for a picture before he can get outside of the shadow of Cameron Indoor Stadium on an otherwise deserted Duke campus in the summer. By the people who constantly interrupted while he was trying to have lunch with his high school coach. “His life has definitely changed,” said Jim Martin, the coach at Providence School in Jacksonville. “It was difficult to get through lunch.” There was Grayson Allen’s life before he helped Duke win a national title and there is Grayson Allen’s life now, and this is one person with two very different lives. He is a star now, suddenly the face of a very different Duke team that will take the court this fall, and he has still yet to start a game at Duke. ‘An adjustment’ The wallpaper on Allen’s phone is a Bible verse from Romans: “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” It was good advice for Allen during his freshman year, when he was the fourth amigo among Duke’s freshmen and didn’t play minutes of consequence for much of the season. Allen’s teammates and coaches raved about what they saw in practice, the soaring dunks and scrambling hustle, but it never translated to the court, at least not where anyone else could see. For this, Allen takes the blame. “I think I became a spectator,” Allen said. “At the beginning of the season there were games I would get in, our exhibition games, the first couple games I got in the game really early and it was easy for me to adapt. As the season went on, you kind of wondered, ‘Am I going to get in? Am I not going to get in?’ “You just kind of fall into that, just like someone watching the game, a spectator. You’re not really into it. You’re physically into it, but mentally you’re just kind of clapping and cheering your team on. You’re not ready to go. It’s an adjustment.” The people around him counseled patience, as did Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who told him over and over again, “Grayson, be ready.” Krzyzewski gave Allen his first real shot in a blowout home win against Wake Forest in March, and when Allen started banging in 3-pointers, he kept taking them. He went 4-for-5 from long range, 9-for-11 from the floor and finished with 27 points. It was the first public visual evidence of what his coaches and teammates had seen in practice. He saw more playing time after that, including an 11-point game in a win against N.C. State in the ACC tournament, but no one, not even Allen’s family, expected what happened in Indianapolis. He played 17 minutes in the national semifinal against Michigan State, more than all but four other games the entire season, retrieving his own 3-point miss and slamming it home as Duke pulled away early in the second half to put the game away. A rematch with Wisconsin awaited, and the moment Allen’s mother remembers above all others from the national championship came early in the game – when Allen entered. “That was a big shock, that he even got in the game,” Sherry Allen said. “Oh, my goodness.” He didn’t just get in the game. As he learned over the second half of the season, Duke didn’t need him to score when he got off the bench. It needed energy. And he delivered. In the second half, with Duke down nine and looking weak, Allen hit a 3-pointer, then outfought Traveon Jackson for a loose ball in a midcourt scramble, what Krzyzewski would later call the turning point of the game, as important as any of his 16 points. “Grayson put us on his back,” Krzyzewski said afterward. When the game ended, as Sam Dekker’s final shot ricocheted away, as his teammates stormed the floor, Allen was still going after Dekker’s rebound, long after the buzzer sounded. The reality of what had just happened had not sunk in. Nor has it yet, really. Someone who averaged 4.4 points per game, who didn’t play at all in four games and played three or less minutes in nine others, scored 16 points in the title game was named to the Final Four all-tournament team. “As far as outside people go, they remember the last thing they saw and that was our national championship game where I played really well,” Allen said. “For me, I look at the whole season. I don’t just look at that game. I look at the first time we played Wisconsin and I didn’t get off the bench.” A new world Allen has been back on Duke’s campus for two weeks, taking a neuroscience class in summer school, minus the teammates who won the national title with him and have moved on to the NBA. He has an almost entirely new group of teammates now, in the strange position of leader and mentor to new freshmen who are as raw and curious as he was a year ago. If he can pass on just a little of his experience as a freshman, perhaps their transition will be easier than his. As for Allen, just what he can contribute remains a mystery. He worked with his high-school coach on his ball handling this summer in the expectation that he’ll be asked to play at least a little bit of point guard, but the tantalizing glimpse of explosiveness Allen showed in Indianapolis raised hopes among Duke fans that even without Jahlil Okafor, Justise Winslow and Tyus Jones, that freshman class still has an impact player to offer. “It’s very different for me, having not that much game experience last year but feeling like the old guy on the team because there’s only four guys returning and I’m just a sophomore,” Allen said. “We’re a young team just like last year again. “It’s a different kind of feeling to be on this side of it, having a season under your belt, coming in knowing what to expect. It’s kind of flipping the role, taking the freshmen under your wing. As it’s going forward, I’m going to try to tell them as much as I can so they figure it out earlier than I figured it out.” Allen demonstrated late in the season that he is what he was expected to be coming out of high school: an athletic dunker and excellent shooter who can score in bunches when he gets hot. But there’s a big difference between doing that in spurts and doing it on a nightly basis. That landscape has changed for him. Just as he has become more recognizable in public, he should have more responsibilities on the court for Duke, but there are no guarantees. Those around him have cautioned him not to assume anything. Just because he’s one of only four returning players – Amile Jefferson, Marshall Plumlee and Matt Jones are the others, along with transfer Sean Obi, who redshirted last season – does not mean he’s guaranteed to start, or even play. High expectations Just as Allen earned his playing time in Indianapolis over the course of the season, he faces the same imperative to earn a starting role as a sophomore. “I didn’t want him to think he had arrived, what he did helping Duke to a national title,” said Martin, his high school coach. “Duke signed some great players. The best players who come to practice every day are going to play. I wanted him to understand he needed to continue what he’s always done.” Still, after what happened in Indianapolis, expectations will be high – as high as his profile has become. Allen’s mother knew things had changed when the family drove back to Jacksonville from Durham together, in two cars, after Duke’s basketball banquet in April. They stopped at a Chick-fil-A outside Fayetteville, and while they were in the drive-thru lane, a man jumped up in the picnic area pointing and yelling. When they pulled into the parking lot of a mall with their food to change drivers, it happened again. “For him now to embrace being recognized, that’s something he’s had to work on and come out of his shell a little bit,” she said. “It’s been good for him, actually, to be able to do that and be a little bit more outgoing.” So after exiting Cameron this past week, he cheerfully posed for a photo with two high school girls from New York who were on Duke’s campus for a tennis camp. Nicole Vereczkey and Kenlie Cerull spotted him from afar, and with no hesitation, ran up to him and asked for a picture. How often does that happen to him now? “All the time,” Allen said. This is his new reality. In one game, one night, he became a star. Three months later, he’s still learning how to be one.",

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

    "DiffbotBody": "Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single. Its ornate but in-the-pocket production is as silky and flawlessly orchestrated a track as Quik has made since the late '90s, and it boasted one of the best lead-off lines for a rap verse this year: \"Now what they want to go cancel Arsenio Hall for?/ Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for.\" Hall’s talk show rose to prominence in the early '90s, around the same time that Quik was finding commercial success, and he appeared on \"Arsenio\" a few times both to rap and DJ; last year—on a newly resurrected version of the show—the rapper announced the release of The Midnight Life. In a song that mostly celebrates living in the present—more focused on the narrative of maintaining than reclaiming glory—the nostalgic line feels poignant; like second-time-loser Arsenio, the perpetually \"most underrated\" Quik has been declared down for the count more than once, and may now be winding down himself. But as in the case of most of Quik’s work, the complaint is just a point in the rapper’s tangled constellation of talking points (mainly, taunts and come-ons to adversaries, fair-weather fans, and the female population of South Central at large), which are as full of ingenious contradictions as his beats. —Winston Cook-Wilson DJ Quik: \"Pet Sematary\" There was a time when the killing in a Lauryn Hill song was done softly and figuratively, through the power of music. That time was long ago. In the late 1990s, a false rumor about the singer/songwriter who would become perhaps rap's most gifted recluse supposedly saying she'd rather die than have white people buying her albums spread so widely there's a Snopes.com page dedicated to debunking it. Over the years since the former Fugees member's sole solo studio album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as she has drifted in and out of the public eye, her self-aggrandizing statements and unfortunate habit of showing up late for live shows have continued to divide, in ways that still say more about the culture than about her. When Hill went to prison to serve a three-month sentence for tax evasion in 2013, she opened herself to further miscomprehension by discussing her conviction in terms of slavery, colonialism, and institutionalized racism. It might not have played well in Peoria, but she was bringing up a legacy America has yet to escape, in ways that became tragically obvious this year. In the same pre-prison pronouncement, Hill said, \"You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\" In 2012, she had premiered a spoken-word piece titled \"Black Rage\", which turned the lyrical framework of Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein's \"My Favorite Things\" into a prolix litany of the crimes that one group of people have perpetrated against another, and a stinging endorsement of anger as an antidote to fear; in later live versions the interpolation became, like John Coltrane's classic cover, a musical one, as well. When the artist, now known professionally as Ms. Lauryn Hill, shared \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" in late August, with a call for peace in Missouri, the times had caught up with her song. She once told an interviewer, \"If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children,\" and this sketch, recorded in her living room, benefits by couching its broad social themes in family-like intimacy; her kids' voices can be heard behind her deepening, huskier roar, along with acoustic guitar and a murmuring rhythm. Some will share Hill's fury, some won't, but her unexpurgated message of focused resilience points toward part of what has been missing all along: A mutual understanding. To promote a new pay-for-view concert video, Hill recently shared a clip of herself performing the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" live in Brooklyn. In the song, as on the original, she raps, \"While you're imitating Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone.\" Simone, the subject of a controversial upcoming biopic, prefigured aspects of Hill's career trajectory in her own evolution toward racial confrontation. Simone reportedly warned Martin Luther King Jr., on meeting him, that she wasn't nonviolent. \"Not to worry, sister,\" King responded; she even later insisted upon being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" You'd never guess it by the ongoing rounds of backlash against Hill, which prompted Talib Kweli to write an essay defending her this year, but this mere Ms. has yet to go as far in her radicalism as the late legend, who, singing the then-new \"Mississippi Goddam\" at Carnegie Hall in 1964, blithely informed a mostly white audience, \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies/ You're all gonna die and die like flies.\" But \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" belongs to that tradition, one of righteous indignation in the face of injustice, speaking to the persecuted wherever they may be, whatever they might look like. And it shows that, for all the actual death and cruelty in the headlines, the sound of music can still be quietly devastating. —Marc Hogan The other side of \"Chorus\", a 12'' single issued at the start of the year by the globally minded electronic producer Holly Herndon, sounds like an audition tape for the relatively esoteric sound-art label Editions Mego. During \"Solo Voice\", slivers and snapshots of her voice twist into pointillist spires—chirpy and more musical than the most recent experiments of clear inspiration Florian Hecker, but only by degrees. Even Herndon’s most kinetic work has always seemed as driven by ideas as approachability, and \"Solo Voice\" is an unabashed expression of the former. Could a disembodied and dissected human voice be built into something new with computers? \"Chorus\" explores a similar line of inquiry. Herndon splits her simple, fetching melody into bits, so that her words seem sung by a cyborg programmed with a speech impediment. Syllables end abruptly, stand alone, and stretch over open space. But Herndon twists those samples of herself around beats that sometimes boom and burst like dubstep and sometimes stutter and sprint like IDM. In the space between the two, Herndon laces a panoply of fragments gathered piecemeal as she browsed online. The result, vividly illustrated in a subsequent video collaboration with Japanese artist Akihiko Taniguchi, blurs the relationship between web and browser, machine and user, data and devourer. Herndon becomes the principal input in a system bigger than herself, and she tries to be altered without being absorbed. It’s a canny reflection on our digital lives, rendered with a physicality that pulls it back into our own mainframe. —Grayson Haver Currin \"I Am Not Afraid\", the track that kicks off the gorgeous In Conflict, is as much a riddle as it is a song. Those who may have arrived at Owen Pallett’s music by way of his theoretical explications of pop tracks wouldn’t have been surprised at the obvious intelligence of the writing here, or the foreboding and beauty of the music behind it. It would have been more discomfiting to reckon with the intense strangeness of lyrics that seem several worlds away from the crush-love-heartbreak-repeat cycle of the pop music Pallett clearly understands so well. Pallett has said that In Conflict is the first of his records on which he tried to write lyrics that were both non-allegorical and autobiographical. But even if the material \"I Am Not Afraid\" draws upon comes from Pallett’s own life, the song is extraordinarily rich in imagery and metaphor, whether it’s Pallett leaving his \"violin unattended in a cab or restaurant\" or sharing lyrics like \"They told me to chew on a toothpick/ They told me to take a deep breath.\" These are depictions of anxiety and anger—heady emotions clashing with the record’s central message that its subject is not afraid and salvation may be found in discipline. So while there’s clearly that eponymous conflict in effect here, the idea motivating the song remains fleeting. The music of \"I Am Not Afraid\" is mostly gorgeous as it transitions from violin to piano and back, but it is also strange, and sometimes frightening (a result of Pallett dropping what he calls \"black notes\"—i.e., the exact wrong note for the melody—into the mix). Accepting the discomfort of the very music here, and accepting the discomfort of the lyrics, becomes both a metaphor and a microcosm of the experience that those born into any of the groups that hold dominion (whites, males, cisgenders) must undertake to reckon with their unearned status. To draw on what Pallett has said directly, this musical and lyrical confusion also functions as a metaphor for his own \"displacement and dysphoria.\" By taking the political and rendering it both personal and deliberately inscrutable, Pallett has managed to confound in the best way possible and create a relatable pop experience for voices that are too often ignored. —Jonah Bromwich It’s been an art from blues to Britney: the song as extended double entendre, one that can come off either unassailably clean or unspeakably filthy depending on the listener’s life experience and cleanliness of mind (or nearness to a Google searchbox). \"Love Me Harder\" is sort of the opposite: even when it’s clean it sounds teasingly off, and even when it’s dirty, it sounds so disarmingly spit-shine clean. Much of it’s the premise: pairing a singer who was a babysitter on Nickelodeon less than half a year ago with a singer whose discography contains endless variations on permanently corrupting young ingenues, with no apologies and no inclinations to change that. Even more of it’s the execution: organ peals timed like winks after each line; Grande switching emotional beats like poses, her voice either knowing beyond her years or just polished to sound like it, with no indication as to which; Tesfaye revisiting the sturdy nocturnal electro-house of his Kavinsky collaboration (a sound that’s been fast adopted by the pop trickbook, from megastars to newcomers), leering about his rep and finding a way to describe hardcore porn acts in PG terms. When these tracks fail, they’re the most embarrassing failures an artist can have; when they succeed, the sleight of song can be breathtaking. Here’s to a generation of kids realizing horrifying things in 2020 about their teenage jam—and what lodged it in their mind. —Katherine St. Asaph Ariana Grande: \"Love Me Harder\" [ft. The Weeknd] Tobias Jesso Jr. isn't the first guy to have his heart squashed by Los Angeles. After failing to make it as a pop songwriter, breaking up with his girlfriend, getting hit by a car, and—icing on the cake—moving to to Vancouver to help care for his ailing mother, balloons fell from the ceiling as Jesso became the world's one billionth failed songwriter. So he dusted off his sister's old piano, wrote a few heart-stricken ballads, and posted them to Youtube. What happened next was unlikely: An email to Chet \"JR\" White (whose band Girls had just broken up) led to a True Panther signing and bam—Jesso's back on his feet, with a debut tiled Goon slated for next year. His breakthrough track, \"True Love\", is perhaps an even less likely success. About as bald-faced and hopelessly romantic as music in 2014 comes, Jesso calls on the spirits of the underdog singer-songwriters of the '70s (think Randy Newman circa Good Old Boys), nicks the melody from Nelly's \"Dilemma\" almost wholesale, and delivers one of the best lump-in-your throat choruses of the year. Which isn't to mention that it sounds like a half-tempo version of the saddest '80s sitcom theme song ever recorded. But there's something so worn and natural about it, it's hard to think of it as anything but the purest declaration of the heart. Call up the YouTube video for \"True Love\", and you'll find a family photograph of Jesso at maybe seven or eight-years-old, looking up at the camera with his fingers poking at a cheap Casio keyboard. It's hard not to believe the kid would make it after all. —Zach Kelly Tobias Jesso Jr.: \"True Love\" Beyoncé hasn’t been a traditional singles artist for years—4, her 2011 opus, didn’t even put anything in the top 10. And when you Beyoncé not only an album into the world but over a dozen songs with prime-time-ready videos, the formula’s bound to be shaken even further. The obvious industry singles—Ryan Tedder collab \"XO\", erstwhile Katy Perry song \"Pretty Hurts\", whatever “Standing on the Sun” was supposed to be in the months Before Knowles—floundered; even \"Drunk in Love\", a bona fide hit that rode the pomp and TV performance circuit to No. 2, seemed more like a populist underdog fighting chart trends than a preordained smash. Yet there were alternatives: 14 songs, all different, yet each personality-packed, like a personality quiz without any of the data-mining malaise—except the sort that produces people’s-choice singles. And the people’s choice, it turns out, was \"Partition\". If Beyoncé-the-statement was reducible to a single track, this would be it. Jay-Z asserts his presence without actually commandeering the track to rap about breastses and breakfast. Beyoncé thoroughly enjoys her reverie, fetishizing their own celebrity because who else gets to do it? And the track balances no-nonsense hitmaking—the hook’s her most traditionally urban radio-ready since B’Day, the beat roaring from simmer to insatiable and back within seconds—and nonchalant trolling. If you think \"Partition\" is a load of oversharing in a cab seat, Beyoncé is mocking you via a French Big Lebowski lecture. If you think \"Partition\" is a big cameras-flashing FEMINIST TRIUMPH, Beyoncé will make you frame that around a goofy Big Lebowski quote, knowing you’ll share it on all platforms anyway. It’s provocative, let’s say; it gets the people going. —Katherine St. Asaph It wasn’t so long ago that being a Young Thug fan felt like you were in on rap’s most rewarding secret. Revelling in the unpredictability of his I Came From Nothing mixtape series, I can honestly admit that, no, I didn’t see his success coming: even at his poppiest, Thug felt way too weird to transcend cult status. Even on his breakthrough release, 2013’s 1017 Thug, the bits that rose to the top were highly tweetable but barely marketable; keep in mind, this was still pre-\"Versace\", a song that would be used as a punchline by \"serious\" rap fans as often as it would be celebrated later that year. That feels like ages ago. Thug closes 2014 as, if not quite a household name, an unavoidable presence in the rap landscape. A short list of stars who co-opted his once-singular swag this year includes Nicki Minaj, T.I., Gucci Mane, and Lil Wayne (his closest spiritual progenitor, who at this point feels prudish in relation), not to mention the dozens of impressionable ATLiens who’ve practically made his yelps and chirps into its own subgenre. It isn’t that Thug’s succeeded in spite of his quirks: they’ve become the hook. The odder he gets, the more people respond, his endless idiosyncrasies feeding the insatiable demand for clicks that’s come to reshape online media. Such a near-sighted focus on the \"weirdness\" sells Thug short. Of his three major singles this year, each highlighted a distinct facet of his skill set. \"Danny Glover\" was peak zaniness, probing the outer limits of what constitutes catchiness; \"The Blanguage\", in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin, presented Thug as a deft lyricist and effective balladeer. But best of all was \"Stoner\", in which words fell short as descriptors and functioned instead as measurements of rhythm and space. If anything, it made more sense as a grime song than a rap song, with Dun Deal’s spare beat challenging Thug to find new ways to make himself comfortable within it. It struck a precarious balance between restraint and release: an unsure hand could've sent the whole thing toppling. It wasn’t weird—it was masterful. —Meaghan Garvey Young Thug: \"Stoner\" There are qualities about Mike Hadreas that make him seem heroic: His songbook takes on themes of trauma and addiction, the body and identity, all in a way that seems designed to protect us—a reminder that we're not alone in our otherness. This year, Hadreas has been selling T-shirts depicting an emasculated Eminem, a proper jab at one of popular music's most problematic living artists. On the shirt, Slim is clad in coral lipstick, just a few shades lighter than the tint Hadreas wore on his watershed \"Letterman\" performance in October, contorting a slow, sultry sway through \"Queen\". Indeed, Hadreas' work as Perfume Genius has opened a crucial dialogue over the past half decade. Recall the 2012 incident with his 16-second YouTube ad for Put Your Back N 2 It getting censored for \"promoting mature sexual themes\" because it featured two shirtless men hugging. As there's no shortage of topless folks on YouTube, the message from Google was clear: it was the queerness that was unsuitable and—as the corporation wrote in a statement—\"not family safe.\" And so, should you need convincing, the quaking \"Queen\" is empirically necessary. \"No family is safe/ When I sashay,\" Hadreas asserts through expressive breaths on the refrain of the year, channeling personal rage into a surreal energy, addressing gay panic—the idea that one's visible otherness as a gay individual makes people uncomfortable, that it’s perceived as a threat to the straight world. Hadreas sounds just as defiant and poetic in 2014 as Patti Smith did in 1975 telling us how Jesus did not die for her sins. And like Smith's earth-shattering subversions of the female archetype, Hadreas' provocations are confident, uncompromising, epic—he appoints himself \"queen\" and owns the supposed flaws of his sexuality (\"cracked, peeling, riddled with disease\") with a deviant wink and demonic smirk. One would expect music that is both radically politicized and universal from someone who grew up listening to \"a lot of badass feminist music\" and who says he's seen Sleater-Kinney at least 13 times. His words alone have such inspired power—imagine them publicly broadcast on a marquee in LED lighting, like a Jenny Holzer installation—but \"Queen\" does not just illuminate the potential of explicit language. It has few aesthetic precedents, though it pushes the borders of pop and avant-gardism in a way Arthur Russell would have appreciated. The cool drag of a drum contribution from PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish morphed the song into what has been aptly described in interviews as \"stoner glam.\" There is a tornado swirling—a deep, booming low-end; abrasive synths rolling into an ecstatic dreamscape; passing clouds made of soul—and Hadreas is at the eye of the storm, a light steadily beaming from the chaos of the world, stepping into the future. \"Queen\" is a gay anthem, but it also empathizes broadly with all people who biologically have less direct access to the top seats in society. In a year that rendered the world's rampant, widespread injustice so depressingly apparent, what could keep us believing that all this music stuff matters so much? It's songs like \"Queen\" and the sea changes they summon that give it purpose. The future of pop belongs to people like Hadreas, who will take us forward to new places we didn't know we needed to go. Surrounded by this loud, extreme music, it sounds like nothing can hurt him now. —Jenn Pelly Perfume Genius: \"Queen\"",
    "LabBody": "In one of 2014’s quietest revelations, Gainesville quartet Hundred Waters transcended one of pop music’s most shopworn clichés. An upstart group emerged from nowhere in 2012 with a polished, wholly unique debut record, is subsequently chased by every noteworthy major-indie, chooses instead to take Skrillex’s money…and succeeds on all counts. The Moon Rang Like a Bell expands on the promise of their debut album without sacrificing anything about what made it good. They upgrade their IDM faerie-queene origins to the oddball electro/R\u0026B mainstage of FKA twigs, Purity Ring, and How to Dress Well, in other words, but on \"Murmurs\", singer/songwriter Nicole Miglis still manages to sneak in the word \"thee.\" The group sets \"Murmurs\" in the kind of ice palace pioneered by the Cocteau Twins or Homogenic, but Miglis pitches her voice to a pained upper register that Björk or Elisabeth Fraser never went. It’s a breakup song themed around a missed birthday—images of candles and wishes abound—but the production’s combination of churchly solemnity and far-off, slow-motion industrial clamor suggest something much more universal: the consistent drone of modern life co-existing with timeless cycles of loss and rebirth. Above all, though, is the song's devotion to \"thee,\" that constant, all-too-human desire to view experience through someone else’s eyes. —Eric Harvey. Hundred Waters: \"Murmurs\" (via SoundCloud)",

    "DiffbotBody": "N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore was hired this week as the new county attorney for Cleveland County, where he lives. Moore, a Kings Mountain Republican in his first term as speaker, will advise the Cleveland County commissioners during their twice-monthly meetings and represent the county in any legal action. His contract, signed Tuesday, calls for him to receive a $25,000 annual retainer and bill at $250 per hour he spends working for the county. “The county was looking for an attorney, and they know that I’ve represented different government units over the years,” Moore said Friday, adding that he sought an ethics opinion from legislative staff, who he said assured him the new role wouldn’t be a conflict. “When I was approached about my interest, I checked to make sure it was ethically OK to do so,” he said. “I would recuse myself from any legislative deliberations or votes” in which Cleveland County government has a direct interest. Lawmakers in North Carolina are part-time officials, and almost all have other sources of income, many from full-time jobs. Cleveland County’s commissioners ended their relationship with the previous contract attorney, Bob Yelton of Shelby, who was paid under the same terms. A few weeks before contracting with Moore, the county hired its first full-time staff attorney, whose job title is assistant county attorney. That employee will “be handling the day-to-day legal work,” said commission chairman Jason Falls. “We are expecting to see less hours billed by the county attorney because we hired a staff attorney,” he added. Still, Moore’s contract requires him to attend the board’s meetings, which take place on Tuesday evenings twice a month. The House typically meets on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when legislators are in session. “I’ll try to be at as many of those meetings as I can,” the speaker said. “I’ve driven down in the afternoon and turned around and driven back that night.” Falls said Moore’s powerful role as House speaker wasn’t the reason he got the job. “It’s hard to separate out the fact that he is speaker of the House,” Falls said. “That is definitely not a negative on his qualifications, but we chose him because of his expertise, because of his integrity and his familiarity with Cleveland County.” According to the Shelby Star – which first reported Moore’s new job – the speaker joked to Cleveland commissioners this week “about having another job that gave him ‘some insight’ about what is going on in the state.” Cleveland County isn’t the only government agency Moore’s firm represents. It has advised the Cleveland County Water public utility for 15 years. Moore pointed out that he’s not the first legislator to serve local government. Former Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton, a Democrat, was the county attorney for Rutherford County while he was a state senator. Rep. Susi Hamilton, however, had to turn down a town manager job offer from Carolina Beach in 2013. The Wilmington Democrat discovered that state law prohibits managers of towns with a population over 3,000 from holding elected office. Jane Pinsky, director of the N.C. Coalition for Lobbying and Government Reform, said Moore’s dual role is legal but could raise eyebrows. “I think the issue here is just that people’s perception is going to be that there’s a conflict of interest,” Pinsky said. “Tim Moore is a smart enough attorney that he’s not going to cross the line.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Same-sex couples will now be eligible for federal marriage benefits, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced Thursday. “I am proud to announce that the critical programs for veterans and elderly and disabled Americans, which previously could not give effect to the marriages of couples living in states that did not recognize those marriages, will now provide federal recognition for all marriages nationwide,” Lynch said in a statement. The Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 ruling last month that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and that all states must grant gay and lesbian couples marriage licenses. Before the ruling, 13 states did not recognize same-sex marriage. Many federal marriage benefits were available to same-sex couples after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal ban on gay marriage. Some benefits, though, including Social Security and veterans benefits for spouses, were still unavailable to these couples if they lived in states that did not recognize their marriages. “With the Supreme Court’s new ruling that the Constitution requires marriage equality, we have now taken the further step of ensuring that all federal benefits will be available equally to married couples in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories,” Lynch said. The Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs said they were still working to implement the ruling, with the Social Security Administration issuing a statement that same-sex couples should apply for benefits right away, if they believe they qualify. The VA said that it will be issuing new guidance shortly, but in the meantime it will temporarily wait to rule on claims that were not covered previous to the Supreme Court ruling. Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney for Gay \u0026 Lesbian Advocates \u0026 Defenders, a legal advocacy group, told AP that there are still questions to be resolved regarding the implementation of the ruling. Issues of couples needing to re-apply if they had already been denied benefits have been raised. \"With this terrific statement from the attorney general, the devil is in the details,\" Henry said. \"Marriage benefits are available to same-sex couples nationwide, and that's as it should be. I think that is what the Supreme Court ruling requires. But what does that mean?\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Who is the best player in the ? Not based on the last 10 years or one game, but over the last year: Who was the best? Good luck answering that one without starting a fight, right? Well, that's what the NFL 1000 aims to do by scouting, grading and then ranking the best players at each position before putting them in order and breaking ties to come up with the top 1,000 players. No narratives, no fantasy football points, no quarterback rating: This is cold, hard scouting. You can find rankings for all other positions on our B/R NFL 1000 main page. The B/R 1000 metric is based heavily on scouting each player and grading the key criteria for each position. The criteria are weighed according to importance for a possible best score of 100. Potential is not taken into consideration, nor are career accomplishments. Cornerbacks have many responsibilities—and those vary depending on the individual scheme. With that in mind, we graded them on run defense (10 points), coverage (75) and tackling (10), plus five points for their value as a starter or backup. In that category, we're looking at whether the player is a consistent starter, a spot starter, a top-level backup or simply a backup-only player. In the case of ties, our team asked, \"Which player would I rather have on my team?\" and set the rankings accordingly. Subjective? Yes. But ties are no fun. Each player was scouted by me and a team of experienced evaluators (Dan Bazal, Cian Fahey, Dan Hope, Marshal Miller, Justis Mosqueda) with these key criteria in mind. The following scouting reports and grades are the work of months of film study from our team. Players' heights, weights, seasons played and coverage stats from NFL.com unless otherwise noted. All other statistics from Pro Football Focus. Begin Slideshow » Coverage: 51/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 5/5 Greg Toler (6'0\", 190 lbs, 5 seasons) has big potential and has flashed top-tier talent at times, but he was far too inconsistent in 2014 as both a cover man and a tackler. On the ground, he saw 14 of his tackle attempts go for naught—a number that puts a huge damper on his run and tackle scores. In coverage, Toler played largely in man schemes while allowing nine touchdowns and letting 56 percent of attempts thrown his way go for a completion. Coverage: 53/75; Run Defense: 5/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 4/5 Coming off the best season of his career in 2013, Will Blackmon (6’0”, 204 lbs, 8 seasons) crashed back down to earth with a rough 2014 campaign. Working as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ slot cornerback for their first eight games, Blackmon was picked on in coverage and did not record a single pass deflection. After missing the second half of the season with a broken finger, Blackmon was released by the Jaguars this offseason. He was picked up by the Seattle Seahawks, where he is competing to be their slot cornerback, but the injury-prone 30-year-old is truly best suited for playing on special teams. Coverage: 56/75; Run Defense: 2/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 Melvin White (6’1”, 215 lbs, 2 seasons) began the 2014 season as a starter for the Carolina Panthers but lost playing time over the course of the year due to poor performance. A big but slow cornerback, White makes some plays on the ball with his length but does not play with enough physicality or fluidity to make up for his athletic shortcomings. He is inconsistent both in coverage and as a tackler and does not make the impact a cornerback of his size should in run defense. Coverage: 52/75; Run Defense: 6/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 At one point, Robert McClain (5’9”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) looked set to be one of the better slot cornerbacks in the NFL. However, his performances since that point have dropped off significantly. McClain struggles with his footwork, something that is a major issue for cornerbacks who play inside, and he can’t make up for that with length or ball skills. While he is a good run defender in terms of reacting to plays and aggressively forcing his way to ball-carriers, he must become a better tackler to truly show value there. Coverage: 55/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 5/10; Starter: 3/5 Chris Owens (5’9”, 180 lbs, 6 seasons) is one of many players across the NFL who is immediately thought of as a good slot cornerback simply because of his size. It’s true that Owens had proved to be adequate in the past, but his skill set doesn’t allow him to handle the two-way game that comes with playing inside. Owens doesn’t have the foot speed or balance to consistently contain the faster inside receivers in the NFL, which showed during the 2014 season. Coverage: 57/75; Run Defense: 4/10; Tackling: 2/10; Starter: 3/5 While Cassius Vaughn (5’11”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) has good long speed, he is slow coming out of his stance and flipping his hips, which enables receivers to beat him off the line frequently. He does not play physically and is a poor tackler. After one unimpressive season with the Detroit Lions, Vaughn signed this offseason with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he will have to fight just to make the 53-man roster.",

    "DiffbotBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway. Separately, P\u0026G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P\u0026G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P\u0026G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P\u0026G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter \u0026 Gamble shareholders could exchange P\u0026G shares for shares of Coty. P\u0026G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P\u0026G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P\u0026G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P\u0026G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P\u0026G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P\u0026G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. “This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,” Lafley said. “We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.” Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P\u0026G’s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal “is a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,” said Ali Dibadj, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. “The timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,” Dibadj told me. “Feels a little amateurish in terms of process by P\u0026G.” The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger, an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. “Sales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P\u0026G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,” Strebinger told me. The brands that P\u0026G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P\u0026G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P\u0026G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head \u0026 Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. “Procter \u0026 Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we’d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,” Erin Lash, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. “However, we don’t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.” The beauty category “has remained a challenge for P\u0026G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,” Lash wrote. “We suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.” The other brands included in P\u0026G’s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice \u0026 Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. acted as financial adviser on the transaction, and Cadwalader, Wickersham \u0026 Taft LLP acted as tax counsel. Jones Day acted as legal counsel, and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P\u0026G.",

    "DiffbotBody": "About 15 to 20 residents crowded New Market’s town hall Thursday night to comment and question representatives about the planned development for the 262-acre property, which was annexed into the town in 2014. Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "DiffbotBody": "It is a natural reaction for us to punish ourselves when we are suffering from heartache. Here's why that's a bad idea, and what to do instead. Emotional pain can be worse than physical pain. When we feel physical pain, we can do something about it; we clean the wound, put on some sterile dressing and give it some time to heal. Whether it is a muscle cramp, a broken bone or a laceration, there is a remedy that will facilitate the healing process. Heartache is different The pain of heartache stings to our very soul. Our hopes and dreams have been dashed to pieces. Like Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall, all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put him back together again. When our heart breaks, it feels as if we have lost a part of ourselves. Read: 10 ways you are ruining your own happiness Our first response is to blame, criticize or condemn. First, we turn against the person who is gone. When we realize that doesn't solve the problem, we turn on ourselves. We argue that we deserve it, for surely we are not good enough! We feel vulnerable and find ourselves susceptible to every look and comment. In order to mask the vulnerability, we adopt self-defeating behaviors. We sleep in, overeat, withhold positive self-talk and make ourselves do things that are difficult, scary or cruel. We think that if we inflict enough emotional pain on ourselves, either we will feel better or perhaps someone will come to our rescue. They will feel sorry for us, bind up our wounds and give us the love that we desperately need. Unfortunately, these types of relationships don't solve heartaches; they create more of them! Healing is possible \"One day while I was lying in bed, nursing my heartache and waiting for the world to end, I heard a knock above my head. I looked up, but there was nothing on the headboard that could have fallen to make the sound. I knew it was God. He was telling me, 'Get up! Stop moping around and do something!'\" Although time may assuage the pain, a heartache does not heal itself. The heart is the very center of the soul; it is the connecting link between the spirit and the body. The person we love becomes a part of us. When they leave, we feel a deep sense of loss, and the pain may seem unbearable. The only way to fill the hole left by a heartache is to turn to God. This requires that we become humble, willing, obedient and serve others. Humility The pain of heartache brings us to our knees. We realize our dependence upon God, and acknowledge that we cannot overcome this difficulty on our own. We need Him to help us. We give Him our burden of weakness and imperfection, and express our desire to be healed. Willingness We accept our imperfect state, and open our minds and hearts to God's healing power. We give all that we have to Him in exchange for His unconditional love. Our souls are bathed with the peace \"which passeth all understanding\" Philippians 4:7. Obedience We truly can feel whole and complete once again. The bitterness of the heartache will subside. We can show our gratitude to God by taking His hand and walking with Him, knowing that no matter what happens, He is there for us. Service As we serve others, our feelings of love for them will increase and we will desire to help those that are in pain. Finding ways to give helps fill the emptiness that our heartache left behind. We will feel a renewed sense of purpose, joy and happiness in life. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Heartaches are not the end of the world if we don't allow them to be. They are simply one more way for us to become closer to God. As we do so, we find that there are many others who walk similar paths, and that our experience can be used to help them.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Strike up the band! The resistance band that is. Whether you are on the road, or barricaded in your home recovering from the death of your favorite Game of Thrones character, a total body workout is always accessible due to the portability and convenience of the resistance band. These flexible flab fighters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making them perfect for your daily exercise routine or assisted stretching (or to sling shot water balloons at that noisy neighbor). Here’s how to make the most of this one-man resistance band show: Chest to Impress. Find a sturdy support beam or column and evenly wrap your band around it at shoulder height. With your back turned away from the supporting structure, grab each handle and take a large step forward. The beauty of the band is that you can adjust its resistance simply by removing slack from the tube. The further you step away from the column, the harder the exercise becomes. With palms at shoulder height, push through your chest until your arms are completely extended. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions. Reverse Gears. The next exercise requires a similar setup, however you will be facing your support column rather than having your back to it. With a handle in each hand, take a big step backwards while pulling your hands in towards either side of your ribcage. Bring your feet back to center, and perform the same exercise with the opposite foot. The reverse lunge row is a powerful movement in that it targets major muscle groups and aids in bettering your balance. Balancing exercises should be incorporated into every workout routine, as they are crucial in strengthening your core, improving the integrity of your spine and preventing injuries from falls. Complete 15 repetitions per side. Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head. Crank out 12-15 repetitions. Repeat each exercise 3-5 times to guarantee a good burn, baby burn. Sometimes the best cure in the fight against fat is to apply a little resistance band-aid. Earn it.

    "DiffbotBody": "Omar Sharif, the Egyptian-born movie actor of virile good looks who became an international heartthrob in “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Doctor Zhivago,” and who made off-screen conquests as a bridge champion and consummate playboy, died July 10 at a hospital in Cairo. He was 83. A son, Tarek Sharif, announced in May 2015 that his father had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Omar Sharif’s agent, Steve Kenis, confirmed the death and said the cause was a heart attack. Born into an affluent family with Lebanese and Syrian roots, Sharif developed an affinity for acting at an English-style private school in Cairo modeled on Eton. With his macho build and soulful appeal – liquid brown eyes, cleft chin, brilliant, gap-toothed smile and (later) a rakish mustache – Sharif quickly found a place for himself in the thriving Egyptian film industry. He caused a sensation in one of his first movies, “The Blazing Sun” (1954), in which he kissed 23-year-old Faten Hamama, a popular Egyptian actress whose reputation for unsullied beauty earned her comparisons to Shirley Temple. They wed they next year – after he converted from Greek Catholicism to her Islamic faith – and they prospered for years as one of the most glamorous couples of Arab cinema. Sharif’s career ascended to even higher levels when British director David Lean cast him as tribal chief Sherif Ali in “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962), an epic about the British adventurer T.E. Lawrence and his efforts to unite Arab tribesmen against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. The film made a star of the previously obscure Peter O’Toole in the title role, became a commercial juggernaut and won seven Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. “Lawrence of Arabia” also provided Sharif, making his Western screen debut, with a spectacular entrance. Cloaked in black, on camelback, he materializes in the shimmering desert heat, as if in a mirage. When Lawrence’s Bedouin guide breaches a desert code by drinking from Sherif Ali’s oasis, the tribal chief cuts him down in a blast of rifle fire. “He was nothing,” Sherif Ali later explains to Lawrence. “The well is everything.” Sharif, who learned to ride a camel for the part, received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Critics found him an intriguing blend intensity and charm. The actor spoke derisively about many of his subsequent movies – “rubbish,” he later called them. But he retained a strong affection for “Lawrence of Arabia” because of the bonds he formed with O'Toole, a companion in drinking and carousing, and Lean, whom he admired for the audacity of his vision. “I also never thought anyone would go to see the film – three hours and 40 minutes of desert, and no girls!” he later told the London Independent. Sharif collaborated again with Lean as the title character in “Doctor Zhivago” (1965), based on Boris Pasternak’s novel about an idealistic physician-poet amid war and revolution in early 20th century Russia. The movie was a box-office smash, but many reviewers felt that the film’s emphasis on Zhivago’s doomed affair with Lara (Julie Christie), no matter how attractive the protagonists or lushly romantic the theme song, was little more than a banal love story. Sharif, who spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Greek, continued to play strong, masculine roles across the ethnic spectrum. He was an Armenian king in “The Fall of the Roman Empire” (1964), the title conqueror of “Genghis Khan” (1965) and a Yugoslav patriot in “The Yellow Rolls-Royce” (1965). In “The Night of the Generals” (1967), a Nazi-era thriller that reunited him with O'Toole, Sharif was a German military intelligence officer hunting down a serial killer of prostitutes. The same year, he played a medieval prince to Sophia Loren’s peasant girl in the panned comedy “More Than a Miracle.” Sharif’s movie roles became increasingly wobbly and beyond his admittedly modest range. While starring as an Austrian archduke in “Mayerling” (1968), a historical romantic tragedy co-starring Catherine Deneuve, he told an interviewer: “If a director wants Omar Sharif to play a part, he gets Omar Sharif, not the reincarnation of some nutty prince. I play Rudolph like I play all my parts. … All I care about is getting to the studio on time and remembering my lines.” He was painfully miscast as the Argentine-born revolutionary in “Che!” (1969) and as Nicky Arnstein, the Jewish gangster boyfriend of showgirl Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) in “Funny Girl” (1968). News of his romance with Streisand onscreen – and off – caused a backlash against Sharif in Egypt amid the Arab-Israeli War. There was a media campaign to revoke his citizenship. “You think Cairo was upset?” Streisand later was said to have quipped. “You should’ve seen the letter I got from my Aunt Rose.” Sharif was ungallant about most of his affairs, which by many accounts included dalliances with actresses including Ingrid Bergman, Tuesday Weld, Barbara Bouchet, Diane McBain and Anouk Aimée (his co-star in the 1969 bomb “The Appointment”). “One month here. One month there,” Sharif later said. “When you’re working in films, you find a lady and you flirt with her instead of being bored.” He also played bridge to pass time on the movie set. Once ranking among the 50 best players in the world, he formed the Omar Sharif Bridge Circus to perform exhibition matches before such spectators as the shah of Iran. Sharif shared a byline on a syndicated bridge column for decades, first with Charles Goren and later Tannah Hirsch. Asked why he spent so much time at bridge when he could have been making movies, he once replied: “The real question is why I spend so much time making movies when I could be playing bridge.” Omar Sharif, a name he adopted for the movies, was born Michel Demitri Shalhoub on April 10, 1932, in the seaport of Alexandria. He grew up in Cairo, where his parents were part of a social circle that included King Farouk, a cardplaying companion of his mother’s. She sent Sharif at 10 to private school, mostly because he was chubby, he told the London Guardian. “My mother, who didn’t speak any English at all, said: ‘I know, the only thing is to put him in an English boarding school. The food will be so horrible that he'll lose his weight.’ ” The school also had a theater, which piqued his interest in dramatics. After graduation, he played billiards and professional soccer and spent a brief, miserable spell working for his father’s precious-wood business. He chanced into an audition for a film under the direction of a friend and starring Hamama. With his boost in stature after making “Lawrence of Arabia,” Sharif asked for a separation from Hamama and eventually a divorce because he lacked the willpower to remain faithful as a major star in the swinging ‘60s. “It was Sodom and Gomorrah,” he explained. Besides Tarek Sharif, his son with Hamama, survivors include a son from a New Year’s Eve indiscretion with a reporter in Rome in the late 1960s. He was not close to that child, telling the publication Guernica in 2012, “Sperm for me is not fatherhood.” Sharif’s movie career went into decline starting in the 1970s with a range of forgettable fare he took to pay off his gambling debts. They included “Juggernaut,” “The Tamarind Seed” and “Oh! Heavenly Dog,” the last starring Chevy Chase and Benji. Bypass surgery in the early 1990s forced him to quit his 100-cigarette-a day smoking habit. Sharif had brief burst of acclaim in “Monsieur Ibrahim” (2003), an art-house film about a Muslim shopkeeper (Mr. Sharif) in Paris who befriends a Jewish teenage boy in 1960s Paris. He won a best actor César, the French equivalent of the Oscar. Off-screen, he often was described as mercurial and found himself at the center of altercations and ugly disputes. He was fined in 2003 for head-butting a French police officer at a casino. Two years later, he brawled with a Beverly Hills parking attendant. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery and was sent to anger-management counselling. In 2011, he was caught on camera slapping a woman at a film festival in Qatar. In later years, his waning health and cash flow forced him to relinquish certain pleasures. He stopped living in the luxury hotels of Europe. He also gave up bridge, gambling, breeding racehorses and squiring beautiful women. “It’s very bad to underperform, as it were, like in bridge,” he told the Guardian in 2004. “The reason I quit is because I wasn’t as good as I used to be. And now it’s the same thing with girls, so why the aggravation?”",

Keep this list handy whenever you need some backup. Note: Resources are listed alphabetically by type. Mental Health Apps Designed by therapist Rosemary Sword, this app uses Time Perspective Therapy, a method developed to unglue us from unhelpful or obsessive thoughts. Chock-full of visual aids to encourage relaxation and self-soothing, AETAS also arms users with a time perspective inventory that helps them understand how they view the past, present, and future will either help or hinder their happiness. ($4.99; iOS) Sometimes, all we need to de-stress is take a few deep breaths. Created by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, this app teaches users how to do diaphragmatic breathing. Features include educational videos on the stress response, logs to record stress levels, and customizable guided breathing sessions. (Free; iOS and Android) This app works as a daily mood and thought diary. But it also has a coaching module that gives tips on sticky emotional situations, like how to ask for what you need without drama or how to successfully resolve conflict. And users get positive reinforcement when they're consistent with their entries. The app also includes a super helpful DBT reference section for more info on coping skills—all backed by research. ($4.99; iOS) Implementing some of the many strategies of cognitive behavioral therapy, this app helps users assess their stress levels, practice mindfulness and relaxation skills, and connect their thoughts to feelings and behaviors. The end result is more calm in your everyday life and more awareness of your actions and emotions. ($0.99; iOS) Want to kick negative thoughts, nix worry, and dial down stress? The array of engaging games, activity suggestions, and gratitude prompts makes Happify a useful shortcut to a good mood.

That's the premise behind this app. But as a bonus, it also allows you to compare your mood with worldwide averages, see which emotions you feel the most, and export your mood tracking data so you can share it with a mental health professional or trusted friend. ($9.99-$12.99; iOS and Android) This mood tracker and resource locator was designed by Emory University researchers to aid in suicide prevention.

(Free; iOS and Android) If you’re a smoker, you probably already know all about the nasty health consequences. But it probably doesn’t stop you from lighting up. But this app's approach is different. It shows you the hit your wallet takes every time you get another pack. Even better: Quit It calculates how much money you save each time you don’t smoke.

From education about mental illness to updates on insurance coverage, NAMI offers a slew of resources. People who want to get informed about the workings of the mind and our government’s recognition of mood and behavioral disorders will get the full scoop here. But arguably the most helpful resource is the heart-wrenching and hopeful personal stories from individuals across the country sharing their accounts of living with mental illness. One of the most comprehensive and trusted sources for information about mental illness, the National Institute of Mental Health's site is packed with educational tools designed to promote awareness and provide funding for research. It serves as a hub on a variety of topics: the latest news on a range of disorders, updates on new treatments, and reports on insurance coverage.

    "DiffbotBody": "The state Board of Land and Natural Resources might restrict nighttime, nonvehicular access to Mauna Kea. Ikaikamaiki Keone-Kinimaka visited Mauna Kea on June 26. State officials released Thursday a long list of issues and problems linked to Thirty Meter Telescope protesters ahead of Friday’s state Board of Land and Natural Resources meeting to consider restricting nonvehicular nighttime access to the Mauna Kea summit region. A proposed emergency rule would restrict access to anyone not traveling in a vehicle on Mauna Kea Access Road from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. The rule would also prohibit camping gear, including blankets and tarpaulins, within 1 mile of the road at any time. Friday’s 9 a.m. meeting is the Land Board’s regularly scheduled meeting in Conference Room 132 of the Kalanimoku Building, 1151 Punchbowl St. While state officials have said the emergency rule is designed to promote safe access to the summit and is not necessarily aimed at any one group, the protesters contend the rule is specifically targeted at them and intended to prevent them from blocking construction of the $1.4 billion TMT project near Mauna Kea’s summit on land they consider sacred. On Thursday the state released three months of activity logs maintained by the University of Hawaii’s Maunakea Visitor Information Station and Office of Mauna Kea Management rangers, along with some highlighted incidents that officials say illustrate the need for the emergency rule. Incidents recorded at the visitor center include bomb threats, theats of violence against TMT workers, glaring and staring at center staff members, yelling in the visitor gallery, harassing visitors and staff, vandalizing the bathrooms, suspected shoplifting of souvenirs from the gift shop, disrupting center operations, smoking marijuana and blocking the road. Incidents observed by the Mauna Kea rangers include the illegal construction of shelters and cultural features in the forest reserve near the visitor center, plus the discovery of invasive ants and plant material — including black bamboo, ti leaf plants, a monkeypod tree seed pod and guava sticks — identified as high risk for introduction of invasive species. According to their logs, rangers also reported hostile and intimidating comments and gestures directed toward observatory workers and visitor center staffers, plus damaged and defaced property. In addition, they reported a drop in the number of commercial tours visiting the summit. Dan Meisenzahl, UH spokesman, said the hostile incidents are not representative of all the protesters. On several occasions, he said, some of them have helped to defuse some situations. Leaders of the “protectors,” as they call themselves, maintain that their three-month presence on the mountain has been generally courteous and respectful, required only by the need to prevent desecration of the sacred mountain. They also say the group practices kapu aloha and aloha aina in a tradition of nonviolent protest and respect and integrity for the land. Mauna Kea Access Road and the Maunakea Visitor Information Station have been closed to the public since a June 24 clash with a TMT work convoy that resulted in 12 arrests. With the help of rocks and boulders placed on the gravel road above the 9,200-foot level, protesters turned back the TMT work crews ascending the mountain to try to restart construction of what’s expected to be one of the most powerful optical telescopes in the world.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

    "DiffbotBody": "With Microsoft making significant layoffs in its phone business this week, it seems to outsiders like an uncharacteristic misstep. How did the tech giant misunderstand the mobile market so badly? As CEO Satya Nadella pulls the company away from unprofitable ventures launched by predecessor Steve Ballmer, it’s worth taking a look at some of the other major blunders that have hit the company. Did you know Microsoft made an MP3 player? Or that Windows Vista’s development was going so badly at one point that they hit the reset button? And that's just the beginning. Nokia With Nokia one of the few companies actually making Windows phones, Microsoft officials were a bit spooked that Nokia might switch platforms and move into the Android camp. Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analysis, explains that Microsoft paid a “strategy tax” by buying Nokia’s devices division in 2013 to make sure the hardware existed to run its software. “Why Microsoft paid over $7 billion for a money-losing business is mind-boggling, but what really hurt was the timing: Microsoft paid the strategy tax after Windows had already lost the mobile platform fight,” Greengart said. Tablet PC Nokia wasn’t the first time Microsoft pushed into the mobile sphere, nor was the iPad the first tablet computer. No, the snappily named Windows XP Tablet PC Edition helped define what Microsoft saw as the future of computing: computers that were more like books, except they had pens and you could touch the screens. The company had eight years between launching the tablet PC and the iPad arriving, and in that time hardware improved, laptops got lighter, and operating systems became more streamlined. None of that mattered in the end. Microsoft had fundamentally misunderstood how people would use tablets, and the iPad set the world alight from the word go. Zune Remember the Zune? If so, you’re one of the few who do. Five years after the iPod came out, Microsoft finally decided it had an answer to Apple’s runaway success. Available at launch in black, white and, er…brown, the Zune had some interesting features like Wi-Fi and a marginally bigger screen to set it apart from the iPod video. None of that mattered, and the launch of the iPhone a few months later did little to help. In 2009, three years after launching, it had a 2 percent share of the market according to NPD. The company finally pulled the plug in June 2012. Ad Tech In 2007, Microsoft decided it was time to jump into another industry it had waited far too long to join. And so it was advertising’s turn, an industry dominated in the online sphere by Google, with Microsoft buying aQuantive in 2007 to make its entry. In 2012, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion write-down on its ad tech investments. In 2013, the company sold Atlas Solutions, part of the aQuantive buyout, to Facebook. The Q4 2014 financial results showed display ads made up 15 percent of total ad revenue, and sure enough last month Microsoft finally pulled the plug. Windows Vista Vista started off life in May 2001 as “Longhorn,” named after a bar at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort. “Whistler” and “Blackcomb” were the codenames for Windows XP and 7, respectively, with “Longhorn” intended as a stopgap release for 2003. Over time, Blackcomb features made their way into Longhorn, and more and more ideas were thrown into the mix. At the same time, Microsoft was doubling down on security updates for XP, pulling resources from Longhorn. In August 2004 it was clear Microsoft had no idea what the plan was, so they started over. Vista finally launched in January 2007, more than five years after XP. It was the longest timespan between releases, cost $6 billion, and was replaced by Windows 7 in around half the time it took Vista to arrive. Windows 8 Unfortunately, the Windows success would soon slip away again. Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows division, was able to implement his vision of how Windows should be. It should work with touchscreen interfaces, kickstart a new app ecosystem and set out bold new ideas. Turns out, enterprise users don’t care about any of that stuff, and consumers don’t want touchscreen controls for their keyboard and mouse. Microsoft was disappointed by sales, and even today Windows 8.1 has a market share of 13.12 percent (compared to 60.98 percent for Windows 7), according to NetMarketshare. Sinofsky, CEO Steve Ballmer’s most likely successor, was eventually forced out in November 2012. Satya Nadella instead took over from Ballmer in 2014, and the rest is history.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Ships. Opium chests. Choppy waters. Warring continents. Flood of Fire, the much-awaited finale to the Ibis Trilogy is packed with all of the above, and much more. Recently, Amitav Ghosh gave Mumbai fans a taste of this heady adventure. Fiona Fernandez met with him to get the back-story of his epic work of historic fiction George Wittet's Gateway of India has a grey hue to it. After all, it's pouring outside. The monsoon is here, we're told. Call it timing or otherwise; we couldn't help but imagine similar brushstrokes paint a vivid picture from 1839-40, in the torrential waters around south China — the area where Amitav Ghosh's Flood of Fire ends in fine form. \"Yes, River of Smoke was launched around this time, too,\" smiles Ghosh when we remind him of the monsoon connect. Our introductions revisited, we are ready to set sail. Pun intended. \"I love being on water,\" when we prod early on, about why a ship forms such an integral part to the trilogy. \"It's such a wonderful thing to write about. It provides you with classical elements like time, place and action. So much can happen in a concentration of space. No wonder Agatha Christie wrote several titles centred on ships,\" he says, with a twinkle in his eye. Despite a packed, superhit launch (Aamir Khan was in the audience) the previous (Friday) evening, there's no trace of fatigue. This, even if we were to factor in an engaging one-hour interaction (Meeting Amitav Ghosh) with nine mid-day readers, barely an hour earlier. Easing into the conversation, he's happy with the way the Ibis Trilogy turned out. \"As I came to the end, it felt satisfying. I am glad with the way it worked itself out. I felt as if I was taking dictation from the book! It was on its own track,\" he quips, to which I ask, \"…like a boatman?\" Ghosh agrees, and we can gauge sea connect. Little wonder then, that when we speak a few moments later about the wondrous mix of languages and dialects in the trilogy, he shares about how nautical language was easy to incorporate — \"I grew up in Sri Lanka, where it's spoken freely. Sri Lanka (Ceylon) was an important stop for wayfarers and traders. Interestingly, I came across similar phraseology in Mauritius as well,\" he elaborates, helping me join the dots. By now, we're soaked in a socio-cultural lesson. The interview must make a re-entry, we realise, before our scheduled time slot runs out. Of characters and challenges So, we ask Ghosh to pick favourites from the trilogy. With a bunch of eclectic, insightful characters, each with their set of quirks, \"It's tough for me,\" he grins. \"They've all been difficult to create. A short pause later, he reveals, \"Bahram Modi was a great challenge. He was a businessman from Bombay who was dealing with opium. I had to enter a world that I was not accustomed to. It was a rewarding experience, especially from a sympathetic standpoint. In fact, he was the second character (Deeti was the first) that I thought of, when I began work on the trilogy. He has a very vivid presence, and is one of the most interesting characters in my entire writing life.\" When we nudge a bit, on whether he missed Bahram in the final book, he adds, \"He was there in spirit. But his wife Shireen was an interesting character as well. It's easy to relate to her, isn't it?\" As we carry on our discussion of the book's central characters — Mr and Mrs Burnham, Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesri and Neel, it's insightful to listen to (and read, earlier) the wizardry with which the reader goes on a seamless ride that pans continents and cultures, separated by water. \"How do you manage to balance the pace of one story such that it doesn't outdo the other?\" we quiz the Kolkata-born author. \"Well, I wish I had the answer!\" he shrugs, sharing a grin. \"At some basic level, it's about instinct. Besides, while working on such a long book, one cannot merely depend on the flow.\" Anybody who has read the trilogy will vouch for the imagery that takes over almost immediately. Like it did in our case. So when talk veers to these intrinsic elements to his craft, he replies, \"I think in a visual way. To be able to write a scene, I need to see it. It's the best compliment if my reader can also do this, while reading it.\" This, we were able to — from the moment we walked into our interview, forty minutes earlier, when dark clouds gathered over the Arabian Sea, in the picture postcard-like view from the hotel window. Just as Ghosh had imagined, possibly, when Bahram, and later, Shireen had set sail, as they stood on the threshold of rewriting their destinies. Quick bites On sailing the seas: I love to head out on sail ships. Most recently, my wife and I did this wonderful trip on an Indonesian cruise called Bugis Schooners. These cruise boats were originally made by a seafaring community called the Bugis. I found it was fascinating to experience Indonesia via water, what with thousands of islands that one encounters along the way. This included a visit to the Komodo Islands too, where we were greeted by many Komodo Dragons! On mastering languages: (laughs) I'm familiar with English, Bengali and Hindi, of course. Then, there's Arabic, and also Bhojpuri, which I learnt from my father who lived in those parts. This helped while writing Kesri's story. As for the language of the boat people, I researched from the archives in China. What's next? There are two non-fiction works. One of these is based on the research that emerged from the trilogy. The second will be based on a series of lectures that I conducted back in the United States. Climate change matters: What I would like to see is large-scale renewable energy sources that are easily possible and available in India. Instead of subsidising gas and power, why not offer subsidies for solar panels? After all, India is blessed with adequate sunlight. This strikes me most viscerally. Even in my home in Goa, I've tried to install solar panels, but have been plagued by so many obstacles. (Amitav Ghosh is a leading world voice who speaks on environmental issues and impact of climate change) Will there be a TV or film series based on the ibis trilogy? Yes, people have approached me in the past. But I don't think about it (smiles). Meeting Amitav Ghosh Malabi Das, one of the nine mid-day readers who participated in a Meet the Author contest held by the newspaper, won her a chance to interact with Amitav Ghosh yesterday. She narrates the experience The Ibis trilogy is complete; the Flood of Fire is on the stands; and, I am going to meet Amitav Ghosh! I could hardly believe it. And, there I was shaking hands with him; sharing a table with a bunch of very informed fans of the celebrated author. I went to the reader's session with Amitav without any expectation, but I came out smiling like a cat who got the cream. Did you know that Amitav Ghosh writes his first draft with a pencil on a sketch pad and the second draft with pen on ruled paper? And that he probably writes 30-40 drafts by the time his novel was done? In the warm, friendly atmosphere of the Business Centre at the Taj Mahal Hotel, Ghosh let us peep into his world — the world of Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesari, Shireen Modi, and Neel. So, how did he go about completing this colossal project — how did he handle the enormous historical data and weave it into these amazing works of fiction? \"Writing is like mediation. Every morning I sit on my writing desk and let my mind calm down, till it is like still water, and then I start to write,\" explains Amitav. Now that the Ibis trilogy is complete what can we expect from Amitav's desk next? It may not be another work of fiction for some time, but we can look forward to some non-fiction that he is currently working on. I must admit, I like his non-fiction as much as I enjoy his works of fiction. Thank you, mid-day! Signing off to return to my autographed copy of Flood of Fire (I am abandoning my copy on Kindle in favour of the hardbound courtesy, mid-day and Penguin Random House.)",

    "DiffbotBody": "Prime minister takes 11 million Greeks to the edge of catastrophe Alexis Tsipras gambles Europe will not abandon Athens As with all gamblers, Tsipras could walk away having lost everything ATHENS, Greece The audacity of no hope creates strange and interesting political behaviors and a willingness to take on unimaginable risks. Today, Greece seems to be surrendering to a debt agreement that will stop the drama, but not entirely end the country’s seemingly hopeless economic situation and debtors’ prison. A few days ago, the unanswerable question was if Greece would leave the euro and the European Union. Political analysts are now asking: What kind of existential game was Greece playing during the six-month standoff with the EU? As of late last week, it was not at all clear that it would end this way. Why? Game theory gives us some insight. Game theory is a formal study of strategic decision-making. It is how mathematicians, political scientists, defense specialists, economists and others try to predict or create desired outcomes. The recently deceased John Nash was a master game theoretician who, as depicted in the movie “A Beautiful Mind,” showed that “every man for himself” was not the way a group of guys could pick up women in a bar. How was this relevant to Athens’ predicament? Game theory shows a way. In my most recent column, I wrote that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras lied, promising to open Greek banks 48 hours after last weekend’s national referendum that rejected European loan terms. I said the banks would not open. They still have not. Yes, Tsipras lied about this. One thing I did not understand, however, is that in high-stakes poker, “lying” is not the same as lying in daily life. In cards it is called “bluffing.” Game theories tell us that poker players raise the stakes, play bad hands, fold good hands and regularly take things to the limit and beyond in order to win. I am not a poker player. Alexis Tsipras is. Big time. Tsipras took 11 million Greeks and the European Union to the edge of disintegration and catastrophe, gambling Europe would not abandon Athens. “There is no Europe without Greece,” said Gianni Pitella, the leader of the European Socialists. Tsipras wagered most Europeans felt that way and would sacrifice to prove it. When Greek banks shut down June 28, I agreed with analysts and German newspapers that declared it “game over” for Greece. For Tsipras and former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, an academic and author of a game theory text, negotiations were just entering a more intensive, higher stakes, all-or-nothing endgame phase. In fact, the Greek negotiating team brashly stated that the moment they walked away from the deal on the table, negotiations had really only just begun. An IMF default was only a few days away. ATM and gas lines grew. Elderly pensioners were stuck without monthly stipends. The political pressure was on. Game over? With an exasperated populace and a radical left leadership calling EU politicians blackmailers, extortionists and terrorists, Tsipras raised the rhetorical temperature and inflamed his negotiating partners’ ire. The prime minister further raised the stakes and held a referendum – a rare and risky political gambit that gave him 61.3 percent of the country’s popular support. The decisive referendum victory for Tsipras both supported his insistence for debt relief and, absent credible domestic political opposition, solidified his leadership in Greece. Gambling so much, so cavalierly, was certainly unfathomable and frustrating for EU leaders like German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble. Such astronomical risk-taking is incomprehensible to most. Tsipras went as far as playing a geopolitical card by flirting with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. His team filibustered meetings and flustered EU partners. He incessantly called and texted Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Tsipras’ actions denied all European leaders a real summer vacation. Affably, Tsipras and company came to summits seemingly unprepared and refused to budge on pension “red lines” or debt forgiveness. Tsipras then doubled-down that the EU would be the first to fold. EU leaders called his team “clowns.” Polls showed about 80 percent of Greeks opposed abandoning the euro or the EU, and strengthened the prime minister’s hand. Tsipras recognized this and used EU rules against a decision-averse, consensus-driven EU itself. He exploited constitutional European rules prohibiting the removal of countries from the eurozone. What was once a European potential safeguard against nationalist anti-euro sentiment became a noose around the necks of 18 other currency union partners. Tsipras tightened that noose to improve his odds. The winner of this “game” is now clear. Tsipras unexpectedly and suddenly raised his stature to statesman and finally acquiesced to the onerous demands of the Europeans, capitulating to a rigged financial system that rewards banks and punishes people. All this happened very late in the game. Prior to this, most calculated that Tsipras had little leverage over his creditors. What he tried to exploit instead was a gambler’s leverage, betting that Europe would not call his bluff up until the last moment when he backed down. Prior to blinking, this gambler politician felt he had leverage by exploiting EU rules binding everyone tightly together. If Greece went over the cliff, Tsipras reasoned and argued, he was ready and willing to take everyone else with him. The U.S. engaged diplomatically to make sure that this outrageous proposition would not be tested. Politics, as Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi has said, “is not for the faint of heart.” Tsipras’ actions for half a year proved this and also provide deep insight into a gambler’s heart. Tsipras will likely walk away with an agreement that buys his country time, but also political and financial pain, with Greek economic growth and debt relief seeming far off. The good news? Tsipras walked his country away from the ledge and back into the EU house. In January, Tsipras pulled out a political revolver, a single chamber loaded with a silver bullet – a threat against EU unity and global stability. The Greek leader’s gamble was a game of Russian roulette. America’s allies should be thankful the gun did not go off.

    "DiffbotBody": "Type 2 diabetes may have consequences not only on the body, but on the brain as well. According to a new study, those with type 2 diabetes experienced negative changes in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, which was associated with lower scores on memory and cognition tests. \"Normal blood flow regulation allows the brain to redistribute blood to areas of the brain that have increased activity while performing certain tasks,\" said study author Dr. Vera Novak, of Harvard Medical School in Boston in a press release. \"People with type 2 diabetes have impaired blood flow regulation. Our results suggest that diabetes and high blood sugar impose a chronic negative effect on cognitive and decision-making skills.\" The study, published in Neurology, involved 40 people — 19 of which had type 2 diabetes and 21 that did not. The average age of participants was 66, and those with diabetes had been treated for an average of 13 years. The participants were tested at the beginning of the study and then two years later. In addition to the cognition tests, subjects underwent an MRI scan of the brain to observe blood flow and a blood test to measure control of blood sugar and inflammation. After two years, the participants with type 2 diabetes collectively had decreases in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, down by about 65 percent. They also scored 12 percent lower on memory and cognition tests than they had two years ago, while those without diabetes scored the same. \"Early detection and monitoring of blood flow regulation may be an important predictor of accelerated changes in cognitive and decision-making skills,\" Novak said. She also added that additional studies with larger sample sets and a more extended follow-up time would be needed to better understand the relationship between blood flow regulation and changes in memory and thinking skills. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95 percent of diabetes cases in adults, and several studies have shown that regular physical activity and a healthy diet can prevent or delay the onset. Past studies have identified links between the condition and problems with blood flow in the brain, but the effect it has on cognition is only now being investigated.

    "DiffbotBody": "ROCK HILL A drug suspect jumped out of a moving vehicle Thursday night at the busy Manchester Village shopping center in Rock Hill. At about 8:15 p.m., while working I-77, officers with the York County Multijurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit stopped a 2014 Toyota Camry rental car with Tennessee tags at the Dave Lyle Boulevard off ramp for speeding. The driver, identified as Gary Snow, 46, of Rembert, stepped out of the vehicle. But then the passenger jumped behind the steering wheel and sped away, said Marvin Brown, commander of the YCMDEU. “The officers chased the rental car with blue lights and sirens activated,” Brown said in an email. The rental car turned into the shopping center and sped through the parking lot. The suspect then jumped from the moving vehicle and ran. The car continued to roll and ran over the curb. “The shopping center was very busy and several persons witnessed the event,” Brown said. The suspect then reportedly threw a kilogram of cocaine into the bush line behind a business. Officers recovered the kilogram of cocaine and seized approximately $2,000 in cash. After a chase, police arrested Gregory Lee Hunter, 32, of Rembert. He was charged with trafficking cocaine and failure to stop for a police vehicle, Brown said. Snow was also charged with trafficking cocaine. Both men have three prior drug convictions. They were were transported to the York County Detention Center, where bond has been denied. The current price for a kilogram of cocaine, Brown says, is $40,000. It retails for an average street value of $100 a gram, totaling $100,000.",

Now 31, he has been cast as a kind of brash hero of our cash-obsessed era on \"Million Dollar Listing San Francisco,\" Bravo's new reality show. It premiered Wednesday. If you watch, you will get to know him, fast: He's the one who refers to his two competitors -- agents Roh Habibi and Justin Fichelson -- as amateurs who were \"going to the prom\" when he was already a seasoned professional. In conversation, Greenwell -- based in Pleasanton, where he founded and runs Venture Sotheby's International Realty, which has 60 agents -- turns out to be less confrontational. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Andrew Greenwell, CEO and principal of Venture Sotheby's International Realty, is photographed July 8, 2015, in San Francisco. Greenwell is one of three Bay Area real estate agents who star in the San Francisco edition of Bravo's \"Million Dollar Listing\" reality show. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) Q Are you surprised to find yourself on this new show? It presents you and your two competitors as if you were pop culture icons. A I don't know if I'd call myself that. I'm just a real estate agent with a camera following me around. Q Tell me about the drama of the deal. Why does it translate to TV? A When you're dealing with someone who has large assets, the emotions run raw and there are no rules. It's a no-rules game. It's one of the most stressful and crazy things about the business, but it's also what makes it exciting. You can get up in the morning and close a deal by noon, but you can also totally lose that deal by noon. Q On the show, you come across as unusually competitive. A You have to be. This is a high-stakes game. There's no messing around. Q Is the show already bringing you new business? A Yeah, I think it's really going to ramp up. People come through an open house and the cameras are there -- it adds a little extra level of desire for them. People want to feel close to the show, close to the brokers. Q Do you feel any remorse over being someone who helps drive this crazy real estate market? The region is becoming unaffordable for most people. A I don't think that brokers and Realtors encourage the crazy market. We simply facilitate transactions. I think one of the things that differentiates me is that I have a business background. My brokerage will do close to $500 million in sales this year, but I actually don't like crazy markets. It's not healthy. You can't sustain it. I have not enjoyed the markets of the last few years in the city and it's actually been slowing down and that brings me great joy. null FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT Andrew greenwell 1 He married Paal Salvesen in April; they celebrated for a week with 40 guests on a 330-foot yacht in the Caribbean. 2 In December, he and Salvesen will travel to Cambodia and visit a rescue, rehabilitation and employment center for survivors of sex trafficking. It is affiliated with 3Strands Global, a charity they support. 3 He cites \"work\" as a hobby: \"I don't know what I'd do without real estate. I might implode.\" 4 He was selling real estate in Seattle when the stock market crashed in 2008: \"I was literally flat broke. I was stealing toilet paper from my condo building.\" 5 His mother is one of his heroes: \"For 30 years, she was CFO of an incredibly large construction company. ... She's a force to be reckoned with. Imagine being a woman in construction in the '70s.\"",

'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By Jonah Goldberg Friday, July 10, 2015, 8:57 p.m. Poor Donald Trump. It wasn't supposed to be like this. For years, wherever The Donald went, he met people who told him he should run for president. His retinue of sycophants surely saw little to gain from explaining that “birthers,” celebrity worshippers and devotees of “The Apprentice” are not a statistically meaningful sample of the electorate. In the past, Trump always pulled back from the brink. Why risk his beloved TV show? Why endure the embarrassment of revealing he's not as rich as he pretends? Flirt but don't commit was the rule. But something changed. One too many Twitter followers said, “Do it!” One too many valets whispered, “America needs you” — probably just before asking for a raise. And Trump took the leap — though he hasn't provided the required financial disclosures yet, which inclines me to think that he will either suddenly find an excuse to retreat or that he has a team of accountants trying to figure out how he can simultaneously save face and avoid perjury. In his announcement speech — the brevity and discipline of which were impressive only by the standards of Fidel Castro or Joe Biden — Trump shouted his certainty that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals to America, but he could only “assume” (sotto voce) that “some” of those Mexicans are good people. Trump's commitment to the GOP has often been situational. Sure, he has put his money where his mouth is, but he's as promiscuous with his mouth as he is with the Trump brand. He's given money to Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Andrew Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and the Clinton Foundation. Asked to explain why, he said, “You're gonna need things from everybody.” (One does wonder what Trump hoped to get from the Clinton Foundation.) This attitude helps explain why Trump is such a fan of eminent domain. The man seeking the tea party's support loves to use the government to seize private land he can't — or doesn't want to — buy fairly. Given the fetid swamp of sanctioned corruption that passes for commerce in New York, it's no wonder he sees nothing wrong with greasing the skids by funding liberal politicians. The great irony is that the man who made his fortune playing the game of influence-peddling and celebrity-mongering forgot that the other players get a turn. Trump has lost his TV show. Macy's will no longer carry his menswear. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who governs like a banana republic demagogue, has declared that he is reviewing Trump's contracts with the city. Meanwhile, too many of Trump's GOP primary competitors, afraid of angering his fans, stand mute or mumbling. Republicans are fielding the best candidates in a generation, but Trump is poised to make them chumps by association. He has no chance of becoming president, but he has the huge potential to deny his alleged party a White House victory in 2016. And when that happens, he will of course stay a celebrity, but he will have traded his fame for infamy, even among those now cheering him on.

While there are certainly pros to a job that immerses you in the lives of the rich and powerful, it can also reveal the ugly side of humanity. Assistants see everything — from their employer’s daily schedule to their most intimate moments. It can feel like a roller coaster, with a boss acting like a demon from hell one minute and gifting their assistant an expensive bag the next. Bosses everywhere have their quirks, but a town like Los Angeles — with its abundance of celebrities and moguls — can breed a particularly terrifying species. Being an assistant might as well earn you a degree in the psychology of human behavior. And while some former assistants would prefer to leave their traumatizing employment experience in the past, there are the ones who have felt scorned enough to write a juicy memoir. Read on for seven scary stories from former assistants with bosses from hell, from a germaphobe actress to a Miranda Priestly wannabe.

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Check out McGregor's exclusive training camp workout and start training like a fighter now. THE WARMUP Dynamic Stretching Duration: 10-15 min. For the workout: Perform exercises 1A-1C as a circuit, then do the heavy bag and grappling.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. And with that, here is how I view the first round. 1. Tampa Bay Bucs - QB Jameis Winston, FSU - I still think Marcus Mariota has a chance to be selected here, much more than given credit for. As Yahoo's Charles Robinson reported, the Glazers have final say in signing off on Winston. But mocks are for what I think will happen, and most signs still point to Jameis. Winston can be a quality starter in the NFL. 2. Tennessee Titans - WR Amari Cooper, Alabama - A shocker, I know. No QB, no trade - I think the connection between Jacksonville and Cooper is permeating to push the move into fruition. My twitter friend Thomas Gower thinks Cooper would be the receiver pick over Kevin White. From a receiver style this does not make a ton of sense, but from a “safe” and projectable traits stance it does. 3. Jacksonville Jaguars - DL Leonard Williams, USC - Everyone is mocking an edge rusher here. I bet the Jaguars think they can get their edge rusher, for the role he will play, in the second round (Eli Harold, for example). Yes, the team signed Jared Odrick to play either the big end or 3 technique. I think the team is concerned with Sen’Derrick Marks’ availability early in the season. Marks’ contract is also very easy to move on from, if necessary. Adding another versatile piece up front that could be viewed as “safe” makes sense. 4. Cleveland Browns (via Oakland Raiders) - QB Marcus Mariota, Oregon - This one is going to get a bit complicated, but stay with me. The first part of the deal is obvious. Here is the hypothetical trade, via Alan Dandar: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. Yes, I know the Jimmy Johnson chart is outdated. But for this purpose, let's use it. Some teams still refer to it as a comparable. For the Browns: After the GM and owner made the wrong quarterback choice last year, there is pressure to make the decision right. Mariota will do just that. 5. Washington Redskins - OL Brandon Scherff, Iowa - Mimicking the recent approach of a division rival. I bet many teams will think Scherff is this year’s Zack Martin. Some might think this is early for a guard. Maybe, but acquiring prospects with traits that translate is paramount. 6. New York Jets - T Andrus Peat, Stanford - Links have sprouted in recent days placing Peat to the Jets as a long term replacement for D’Brickashaw Ferguson. It makes sense. The question is where Peat plays in 2015 before moving to left tackle in 2016. The Jets have had guard issues. 7. Oakland Raiders (via Chicago Bears) - EDGE Alvin Dupree, Kentucky - After trading down, the Raiders trade back up to land their target. Again, via Alan Dandar, here is the second hypothetical trade: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. This leaves the Raiders with picks 7, 19 and 71 in the first three rounds, basically converting a second round pick into pick No. 19 by just moving down a few slots. Dupree’s play on the field does not warrant a selection this early, but due to the “upside” I would be surprised if Bud isn’t a top three edge rusher selected. 8. Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Dante Fowler, Florida - There are plenty of connections here. Namely, the position need and Dan Quinn’s history with Fowler. Fowler is very active with his hand and length use to create separation. I bet he is the standard top edge rusher on most teams’ boards. 9. New York Giants - WR Kevin White, WVU - Another WR for the Giants? It seems the team focuses on OL, WR and pass rushers early on. The prospects left at two of those positions do not fit the Giants’ types.Rueben Randle is average and has one year left. Victor Cruz is coming off injury. The team did give a large contract to Dwayne Harris, but he would be best inside. White and OBJ would be quite a tandem. 10. St. Louis Rams - OL La’El Collins, LSU - I have no idea how to approach La’El’s projection. So, I will just keep it where it is. If the Rams select Collins, who plays LT? Either way, you have two powerful blockers along the offensive line in an offense that will need to keep its quarterback clean in the pocket and open running lanes. 11. Minnesota Vikings - CB Trae Waynes, Michigan State - Everything points to the Vikings selecting a cornerback. So will it happen? I could see one of three names: Waynes, Byron Jones and Kevin Johnson. Waynes is a press corner (or man in his zone) who uses length and frame to stick with receivers and combat the catch point. 12. Chicago Bears (via Raiders and Browns) - DT Danny Shelton, Washington - The Bears drop down only a few spots and exchange a third for a second and a six for a five. Look at pick No. 7 for more details. The team does not have a natural fit at nose tackle, and Shelton has consistently said the Bears have Browns have displayed the most interest in him. 13. New Orleans Saints - EDGE Vic Beasley, Clemson - My buddy Tony Pauline recently stated the Saints are very interested in Beasley. Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16. Houston Texans - CB Byron Jones, UConn - When I look at the Texans I see a glaring need at corner with Johnathan Joseph likely entering his last year with the team. But why is it not frequently mocked in the first round. The NFL like Jones more than I do.

Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. 17. San Diego Chargers - RB Melvin Gordon III, Wisconsin - Two running backs in the top 20? Let’s destroy the narrative, NFL. Again, I’ll bring back the “foundation piece” logic. A team could look at other non-RB talents in this class and view them as role players. Then they could look at a ball carrier. 18. Kansas City Chiefs - LB Eric Kendricks, UCLA - The Chiefs have to improve their inside linebackers. With so much talent up front, Kendricks would thrive in Kansas City. Add in the fact Derrick Johnson is in a contract year coming off injury, and it makes a lot of sense. 19. Oakland Raiders (via Cleveland Browns) - WR Breshad Perriman, UCF - Receiver is still a need for the Raiders. If they want Derek Carr to stretch the field more this year, they need a receiver with those intermediate and downfield skills. Perriman has them. 20. Philadelphia Eagles - OL Donovan Smith, Penn State - Surprise? Smith checks all the boxes the Eagles (apparently) look for: Senior Bowler, athletic and visited the team’s facility. I don’t love Smith’s game, but teams who do likely think he can play guard and tackle. They must be able to unpack the traits he offers. 21. Cincinnati Bengals - T D.J. Humphries, Florida - I don’t love this fit. However, both of the Bengals’ tackles are entering contract years. Humphries, Cedric Ogbuehi, Ereck Flowers, etc. are all options. Humphries has added weight during the draft process and now sits above 300 pounds. 22. Pittsburgh Steelers - CB Kevin Johnson, Wake Forest - Kevin Johnson could be selected much earlier. The Wake Forest corner has awareness and finds the football in both man and zone situations. There is little wasted movement to his game and he attacks the catch point. 23. Detroit Lions - DT Grady Jarrett, Clemson - Grady is not just a 1 technique. Yes, he can play it in the NFL and di at Clemson, but expect him to play a lot of 3 technique in the NFL. He will be an upfield disruptor from either spot while also holding his own against the run. He should be a first round pick, and the Lions have a need now and in the future. 24. Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Shane Ray, Missouri - This is a tough call, as Ray could easily land in the second round. He tested as a bad athlete (in the 22nd percentile for his position) but does maximize it on the field and possesses a great motor. Does that tape compensate for poor athleticism, a toe injury which might need surgery and a recent marijuana citation? I think Preston Smith and Owamagbe Odighizuwa are more talented prospects, but this isn’t an exercise in what I would do. 25. Carolina Panthers - LB Shaq Thompson, Washington - I know, where is the tackle? Cedric Ogbuehi makes a lot of sense. So does an edge rusher like Owa or Preston Smith. But Shaq’s comparison has been Thomas Davis all along, and the team needs TD’s long term replacement. Shaq can fill a coverage role early on in high percentage passing situations. 26. Baltimore Ravens - DL Arik Armstead, Oregon - Personally, I think Ozzie gets another great talent here. CB Marcus Peters is an obvious possibility. Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith. continue story »",

The NFL like Jones more than I do. ~ Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. 17. San Diego Chargers - RB Melvin Gordon III, Wisconsin - Two running backs in the top 20? Let’s destroy the narrative, NFL. Again, I’ll bring back the “foundation piece” logic. A team could look at other non-RB talents in this class and view them as role players. Then they could look at a ball carrier. 18. Kansas City Chiefs - LB Eric Kendricks, UCLA - The Chiefs have to improve their inside linebackers. With so much talent up front, Kendricks would thrive in Kansas City. Add in the fact Derrick Johnson is in a contract year coming off injury, and it makes a lot of sense. 19. Oakland Raiders (via Cleveland Browns) - WR Breshad Perriman, UCF - Receiver is still a need for the Raiders. If they want Derek Carr to stretch the field more this year, they need a receiver with those intermediate and downfield skills. Perriman has them. 20. Philadelphia Eagles - OL Donovan Smith, Penn State - Surprise? Smith checks all the boxes the Eagles (apparently) look for: Senior Bowler, athletic and visited the team’s facility. I don’t love Smith’s game, but teams who do likely think he can play guard and tackle. They must be able to unpack the traits he offers. 21. Cincinnati Bengals - T D.J. Humphries, Florida - I don’t love this fit. However, both of the Bengals’ tackles are entering contract years. Humphries, Cedric Ogbuehi, Ereck Flowers, etc. are all options. Humphries has added weight during the draft process and now sits above 300 pounds. 22. Pittsburgh Steelers - CB Kevin Johnson, Wake Forest - Kevin Johnson could be selected much earlier. The Wake Forest corner has awareness and finds the football in both man and zone situations. There is little wasted movement to his game and he attacks the catch point. 23. Detroit Lions - DT Grady Jarrett, Clemson - Grady is not just a 1 technique. Yes, he can play it in the NFL and di at Clemson, but expect him to play a lot of 3 technique in the NFL. He will be an upfield disruptor from either spot while also holding his own against the run. He should be a first round pick, and the Lions have a need now and in the future. 24. Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Shane Ray, Missouri - This is a tough call, as Ray could easily land in the second round. He tested as a bad athlete (in the 22nd percentile for his position) but does maximize it on the field and possesses a great motor. Does that tape compensate for poor athleticism, a toe injury which might need surgery and a recent marijuana citation? I think Preston Smith and Owamagbe Odighizuwa are more talented prospects, but this isn’t an exercise in what I would do. 25. Carolina Panthers - LB Shaq Thompson, Washington - I know, where is the tackle? Cedric Ogbuehi makes a lot of sense. So does an edge rusher like Owa or Preston Smith. But Shaq’s comparison has been Thomas Davis all along, and the team needs TD’s long term replacement. Shaq can fill a coverage role early on in high percentage passing situations. 26. Baltimore Ravens - DL Arik Armstead, Oregon - Personally, I think Ozzie gets another great talent here. CB Marcus Peters is an obvious possibility. Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith.",

    "DiffbotBody": "'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Tuesday, July 7, 2015, 9:00 p.m. I love grilling vegetables because doing so concentrates their natural sugars and amps up their flavor. During the summer, the usual suspects are zucchini, eggplant, onions, peppers and corn. They're all delicious this way and — Bonus! — they all become tender in an agreeably short amount of time. But it recently occurred to me that a number of the veggies I love roasting in the oven — broccoli, cauliflower and carrots — might also shine if cooked on the grill. Turns out, they do! The first problem was to figure out how to cut these vegetables so they wouldn't fall through the slats of the grill grates. The solution was to keep them in big pieces; I cut the carrots in half lengthwise, left the broccoli attached at the stalk, and sliced the cauliflower head straight down into half-inch cutlets (or “steaks”). These precautions kept the vegetables from falling into the flames, which allowed me to discover that it took forever for them to become tender. To speed up the process, I started by blanching them. After this quick bath in boiling water, I popped the vegetables in ice water to stop the cooking, then made sure they were dry before oiling, seasoning and grilling. Suddenly, these guys took no time at all to get tender. And they browned nicely along the way. Yay! Also, sure enough, their flavor became concentrated, just as it does when roasted. Indeed, it was assertive enough to pair up with a tahini sauce and spicy panko crumbs. When the vegetables are this robust, you may even decide you don't need the grilled steak. Chef Sara Moulton writes this column for the Associated Press. Grilled Vegetables With Tahini Sauce and Spicy Panko Start to finish: 1 hour 1⁄4 cup tahini, well stirred 2 1⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons water, plus more if needed for sauce 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt 1⁄2 cup panko bread crumbs 1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper Water for cooking and cooling vegetables Ice 1 head broccoli, quartered down the center 1 small head cauliflower, sliced into 1⁄2-inch-thick “steaks” 6 large carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise Vegetable or canola oil, for brushing the vegetables Freshly ground black pepper In a medium bowl, stir together the tahini, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the water, lemon juice, garlic and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt. Add additional water if necessary to achieve a pourable consistency. Set aside. In a large skillet over medium, heat the remaining 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the crushed red pepper and a hefty pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the bread crumbs turn golden, for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a grill to medium. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice and water and place it next to the pot. Add the broccoli and cook it for 2 minutes. Use tongs to remove the broccoli from the water and place it in the ice water. Cool it completely, then pat dry with paper towels. Repeat this process with the cauliflower and carrots, cooking the cauliflower for 2 minutes and the carrots for 3 minutes. Brush all of the vegetables well on both sides with vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper and, working in batches if necessary, grill them on direct medium heat, with the grill covered, until they have distinct grill marks on the bottom, for about 5 minutes. Turn them over and grill on the second side until they have distinct grill marks on the second side and are tender, for about another 5 minutes. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, drizzle with the tahini sauce and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s been a rough few weeks for Sarah Palin… Last month, the country was shocked when her daughter Bristol Palin called off her wedding to Sgt. Dakota Meyer just days before it was set to take place amidst claims he had been married to a “secret wife” years before. Weeks later, it was revealed that Bristol is currently pregnant with her second child out of wedlock, and she has no plans to get married anytime soon. In the middle of those scandals, Fox News parted ways with Palin when they decided not to renew her million dollar contract last month. Now, Palin has just quietly announced that she will be shutting down the subscription-based sarahpalinchannel.com just a year after it debuted. According to Mediaite, the site offered exclusive Palin content for an annual subscription fee of $99.95, and they will now be giving a refund for the remainder of the year to all customers. Here’s the full statement the Palins put on the website: Effective August 1st, the Governor will be making all of her content free on her Facebook page and at SarahPac.com. • If you are a monthly subscriber here on SarahPalinChannel.com, you will not be charged anything after this month. There’s nothing that you need to do. • If you are an annual subscriber, you can have the balance of your subscription refunded to your credit card or you can roll your subscription into one of the other channels on our network. If you choose this option, you’ll get an EXTRA month absolutely FREE. Our networks include: – New Life TV – Recharge your relationships and grow closer to God – Alive with Joan Lunden – A vibrant community for women’s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors – K-Love TV – Christian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values Palin also issued a video message in which she did her best to make the change look like a positive thing. “It’s starting August 1st, everything’s free, and just to let you know, that it is an honor to have you subscribe, really it’s been so illuminating and still is so illuminating to read and to respond to many of your insightful comments about current events, about so many things going on in our world today,” Palin said in her video message. She went on to claim that this decision to make all content free stems from a desire to, “make sure that your voices and mine are heard by the widest possible audience across this great land of ours” during the next election. While this sounds nice, it also reveals that Palin was not getting the amount of subscribers she was looking for. She would not be making all the content free if she was making a good amount of money with subscribers, so this change reveals that Palin is not doing as well business-wise as she might have thought. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the entire Palin family. We need to keep them in our prayers!",

    "DiffbotBody": "The accolades continue to roll in for Merced softball star Madilyn Nickles. The soon-to-be senior was named a first-team All-American as a multipositional player by FloSoftball on Thursday. Nickles was also named to the MaxPreps second-team All-American on Thursday. “I’m actually surprised,” said Nickles, who was also the Sun-Star Player of the Year. “I’ve never gotten this many awards or had my name on so many lists. I think it’s really amazing.” Nickles went 22-6 with a 1.18 ERA this season as a pitcher for the Bears. She finished ninth in the state with 287 strikeouts in 1782/3 innings, according to MaxPreps. She also hit .526 with eight home runs and 46 RBIs this spring. Nickles was named second-team All-American by USA Today earlier this summer. Pacheco’s Gia Rodoni earned second-team All-America honors by FloSoftball earlier this week as a multipostional player. “It’s awesome,” Rodoni said. “All my hard work and dedication have been recognized. I was thinking about it last season when a lot of the players I play travel ball with got this type of recognition. It’s cool to get it, too.” Rodoni was named the Western Athletic Conference MVP after leading Pacheco (13-15) to a conference title with a 10-2 WAC record. Rodoni was 13-6 with a 0.58 ERA as a pitcher with 256 strikeouts in 121 and 1/3 innings. Rodoni only gave up 47 hits all season. The University of Baylor-bound hurler hit .324 and led Pacheco with three home runs and 22 runs. “It’s quite an accomplishment,” Panthers coach Charlie Pikas said. “Any time you throw around the words ‘All-American’ you did something pretty good at a high level. Since I’ve been in town, Gia is the only player I’ve seen named to the first team Western Region and the only player to get any type of All-American recognition.” Rodoni is spending her summer playing for the California Grapettes. She just returned from a tournament in Boulder, Colo. She leaves for Baylor on Aug. 15. “I’m so excited,” Rodoni said. “I have a countdown going. I’m excited to go to a new state and meet new people and coaches. I’m going to a college and playing softball, which is something I’ve dreamed of doing since I was a kid.” Nickles, who has verbally committed to UCLA, has spent her summer playing on the ASA/USA Junior Women’s National Softball Team as the youngest member. “It’s been cool,” said Nickles, who is home in Merced for 10 days before returning to Ohio with the junior national team. “We’ve traveled a lot and met a bunch of people. I’ve had little girls come up to me and tell me they want to do what I do when they’re older. It’s really inspiring and makes me want to be a better player.” One thing Nickles has improved on is signing autographs for the girls at the games and the youth clinics the team has participated in. “I’ve learned the messier the better with autographs,” she said. Nickles has traveled to Oklahoma, Texas and Ohio before competing in the World Cup X softball tournament in Irvine last week, where the junior national team went 3-4 against older teams from other countries. Nickles had at least one at-bat in the six of the seven games, going 4 for 14 with three runs and two RBIs. Her big game came in a 10-4 win over Venezuela in which Nickles went 3 for 4, including a double and a triple, with a run and two RBIs. “I had a lot more family and friends at that game,” Nickles said. “I think them being there made me more comfortable and confident.

    "DiffbotBody": "With the majority of head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad back in pre-season training, preparations for Tottenham Hotspur's 2014-15 campaign are well underway. For supporters, glimpses of the team's sessions on social media are better than nothing after a month away. But the opportunity to actually see their team in action—players new and old working together for the first time—that is when things begin to feel real again. Over the following pages Bleacher Report looks at Tottenham's announced opponents for this summer's friendlies. We begin with the League One outfit hosting a Spurs XI side (likely consisting of development squad talent and any auxiliary players Pochettino needs to run the rule over), right up to the big-name opposition the first team will face just days prior to the Premier League season opener. Pre-season only tells us so much, but they are nonetheless fascinating steps toward the proper action beginning. Begin Slideshow » Tottenham's first opponents of the summer, Peterborough United, got their pre-season off to a winning start this past week with a 3-2 win over Dulwich Hamlet. On the scoresheet was striker Joe Gormley, signed in June after netting 40 goals for Northern Irish side Cliftonville last season. The 26-year-old's scoring exploits saw him mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by UEFA.com's Darren Fullerton in the spring. Now Peterborough manager Dave Robertson is hoping Gormley can help fire his team out of League One. \"I'm over the moon, he's a fantastic signing for us,\" Robertson told The Posh TV. \"We know that Joe is going to bring goals to the team next season.\" Ninth in England's third tier last season, Posh have also added former West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison to a squad that includes former Spurs goalkeeper Ben Alnwick. The new blood, coupled with last season's experience, has suitably raised expectations. \"Anything but promotion is failure in my eyes,\" defender Michael Smith admitted to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, per BBC Sport. With a game against West Ham already under their belts by then, Peterborough should be in shape to provide Spurs a decent examination of their burgeoning fitness levels. After 2014's three-match North American tour, Tottenham make a briefer visit to the States this year as they participate in the MLS All-Star Game. The eighth English club to be invited to take on the league's best since the old East vs. West All-Star format was abandoned, Spurs follow Bayern Munich who were defeated 2-1 in last year's match. Preferring to keep most of his team's preparations closer to home, the fixture is Pochettino's one pre-season concession to the now-routine activity of Premier League clubs heading overseas to further their global brand. Despite being a primarily commercial exercise, Spurs should find an exacting on-pitch challenge in the form of an MLS select group attempting to again demonstrate their ability against one of European football's famous old names. The still-to-be-confirmed team could well feature former Spurs striker Robbie Keane, in his fifth year with the division's reigning champions Los Angeles Galaxy. For several of Pochettino's team, it will be their first opportunity to get some important minutes in their legs ahead of the Premier League season. Those not making the trip to Colorado will be heading to Hertfordshire as Spurs open August away at . A frequent pre-season opponent over the years, Stevenage's Lamex Stadium also hosts the club's under-21 fixtures that don't take place at the training ground or White Hart Lane. This latest meeting carries extra intrigue in that it is one of the first games for recently installed Stevenage boss and Spurs Hall of Fame inductee Teddy Sheringham. \"The aim is to do better than last season,\" said Sheringham to his new club's official website following his appointment, while understanding that will be difficult given they reached the League Two play-off semi-final. The existing Spurs links at the club did not escape him either. \"I know a few of the boys, the likes of Chris Day were at Tottenham, I think Charlie Lee might have kicked me once or twice when he was coming through the ranks. I know Ronnie Henry too.\" Defender Mark Hughes, midfielder Steven Schumacher and centre-forward Brett Williams have all been drafted in to join those already there. Sheringham told the club's website he intends \"to bring in two or three more players at least\" but also stated \"I like what I have got now, the base of what we have looks really good.\" The Boro first team plays Wealdstone in its first friendly this weekend before visiting St Neots Town next week. Prior to taking on Tottenham in the final warm-up before the season begins, Sheringham's squad will take on another two of his old clubs, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, , have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him. Indeed, the Mirror's Liam Corless reports Real fans were chanting not-so-secret target David De Gea's name during the unveiling of the aforementioned signing from Porto. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid, Tottenham will have one more match in Munich the following day. They will face either or hosts Bayern in either the third/fourth play-off or final. Last season's 10th-place finish in Serie A has prompted change on and off the pitch at Milan. Pippo Inzaghi has been replaced with Sampdoria boss Sinisa Mihajlovic in the San Siro hot seat (almost as toasty as that found at the Bernabeu). Luiz Adriano and Carlos Bacca formerly of Shakhtar Donetsk and Sevilla, respectively, have been brought in to bolster the team's flagging attack. From within Italian borders they have drafted in Andrea Bertolacci and Luca Antonelli to try and improve things in midfield and defence. The Rossoneri would kill for the kind of season Bayern Munich had. Despite a dominant run to the Bundesliga title, the failure to win the Champions League has upped the pressure on Pep Guardiola. Bayern have been brilliant more often than not on his watch. Yet Guardiola's inability thus far to replicate the success enjoyed by the team in Jupp Heynckes' final season two years ago could count against him soon enough, no matter the difficulty of matching 2012-13's extraordinary treble. Should Spurs cross paths with Bayern in August, and depending on the circumstances, they could be witness to a fascinating atmosphere at the Allianz Arena. Iffy performances from the German side in their own tournament do not necessarily mean anything at such an early stage. But Guardiola and his team would prefer to launch their latest pursuit for glory and history in the most positive fashion possible.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. \"Brown Sugar\" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, \"all the nasty subjects in one go\"). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R\u0026B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of \"Wild Horses\" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of \"Dead Flowers\" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (\"You Gotta Move\") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R\u0026B of \"I Got the Blues\" to the crunchy boogie of \"Bitch\" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on \"Dead Flowers\" is obviously played for laughs, but \"You Gotta Move\" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. \"I Got the Blues\" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. \"Sister Morphine\" and \"Moonlight Mile\" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of \"Brown Sugar\" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on \"Miami Vice\" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.",

    "LabBody": "Las Vegas • The Las Vegas 51s erupted for two four-run innings in their 8-4 win over the Salt Lake Bees on Friday night. The Bees grabbed a 1-0 lead in the second inning on a sacrifice fly by Jett Bandy, but the 51s came back with two runs in the bottom of the second on a two-run homer by Brandon Allen. Las Vegas would also score two runs in the third and again in the fourth to take a 6-1 lead. Salt Lake would chip away with one run in the fifth on a single by Josh Rutledge and two in the sixth on a two-run single by Kaleb Cowart, but the 51s would get a two run homer by Alex Castellanos in the bottom of the sixth to close out the scoring in the game.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday is Comic-Con's sucker baby — a day so easy you don't know what everyone was warning you about. We pretty much walked into the infamous Hall H on the first morning of Comic-Con 2015 — no wristbands and little waiting required. But there were already people camped out in line for the next day's panels, the wristbands for which wouldn't get handed out for 12 hours. The first panel of the day was reserved for Open Road, the distributor behind such films as \"Dope\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" With no description in the schedule, most, if not all, of those in attendance were just waiting around for something else later in the day — the \"Hunger Games\" panel or \"Doctor Who.\" When its start time came and went, some in my section speculated that it'd just been canceled. Then Bill Murray entered the room. Open Road used its hour in Hall H to promote \"Rock the Kasbah,\" a comedy in which Murray stars as a rock music manager who discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice in Afghanistan. It co-stars Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan and Danny McBride, but all the movie needs to drum excitement is Murray, and the marketers know that. He entered through the crowd and answered the moderator's first question in character. The name cards on the dais often give away who's on-hand, but his read, \"Richie Lanz.\" In his first-ever Comic-Con appearance, Murray played to the crowd. \"I feel like I fit in,\" he said. \"I feel like I could fall down in any of these aisles right here and be left alone until I woke.\" What followed was a master class in fan appreciation. By turns funny and gracious, he flirted back when one woman offered to let him spend the night with her on the convention-center lawn. He encouraged a young man who was so nervous that his knees were shaking to move the shaking up to his hips and then to his arms; the kid did, dancing in front of thousands. He was philosophical and sincere, greeting even the most awkward and rambling questions with wit and grace. “I must say it feels wonderful to be in this room,” Murray said. “I like when people get excited about something. There’s a lot of people who don’t get excited about much at all.” With no warning that he’d even be there, it’s likely that no one in Hall H on Thursday morning was there to see Bill Murray. And “Rock the Kasbah” isn’t your typical Comic-Con film. But the move got some of the world’s most rabid pop-culture fans some face-time with one of the industry’s most personable stars — and got Open Road’s little movie in front of them.",

    "DiffbotBody": "If you are at Chicago's Midway Airport or on board a Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) flight in the days ahead, don't be surprised if you see a lot of smiling Southwest flight attendants in your midst. Midway is Southwest's largest hub, and home base for many of the carrier's flight attendants. Late last week, the executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, who represent more than 13,500 Southwest flight attendants altogether, voted to approve a tentative new contract, which over the next several weeks will be presented to the full membership to ratify. A spokesman for Local 556 today said the vote on the new contract should be completed by the end of July. If, as expected, the contract is approved by the full union membership, Southwest flight attendants would, according to Local 556 President and lead negotiator Audrey Stone, \"continue to be the highest paid in the (airline) industry through 2019.\" The new contract also would be retroactive to 2013 when negotiations began. A spokesman for Local 556 said the contract does include pay raises for flight attendants, who in turn would agree to work rule revisions in exchange for the higher pay. Full details of the tentative new collective bargaining agreement will be released soon, the Local said. Southwest's tentative new contract with its flight attendants, however, still leaves the low-fare behemoth without new contracts with three major units in its workforce — pilots, mechanics and ramp agents who handle baggage and other crucial plane servicing functions at the gate. Southwest flight attendants were in negotiations for two years on their new contract. But ramp agents, who are growing increasingly restless, have been without a new contract for some four years. A large group of ramp agents recently picketed Southwest's annual meeting, and ramp agents who were unhappy about the excruciatingly slow progress of contract talks are believed to have been a key factor in the historic Southwest Airlines meltdown at Midway Airport in early 2014 that left 16 Southwest planes filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. The recent picketing and other rumblings about labor unrest at Southwest may have prompted Southwest CEO Gary Kelly to speed up efforts to get new contracts with all of the various unions who comprise his airline's workforce. Any major concerns about possible employee strikes could cause Southwest customers to consider booking flights with competitors instead.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A joint letter sent by human rights groups to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of enhanced interrogation techniques revealed by a Senate report released late last year. The letter, signed by Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International, asked Lynch’s office to investigate “torture and other violations of U.S. law” in connection to the programs. A petition with 111,788 signatures was attached to the joint letter. In the six months since the Senate report was released, the letter says, the Obama administration hasn’t taken any steps to criminally investigate the interrogation practices. “The Justice Department has a clear responsibility to carry out a credible and comprehensive criminal investigation into the overwhelming evidence that U.S. officials used torture in violation of U.S. law,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a press release. “The Obama administration’s continued failure to act in the face of this mountain of evidence risks sending the message that torture is a valid policy option rather than the crime that it is.” The Department of Justice, in a statement provided to International Business Times, said that it looked into the programs in both 2009 and again after the torture report was released. \"In 2009, the Attorney General directed a preliminary review of the treatment of certain individuals alleged to have been mistreated while in U.S. Government custody subsequent to the 9/11 attacks. That review generated two criminal investigations, but the Department of Justice ultimately declined those cases for prosecution because the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain convictions beyond a reasonable doubt,\" a spokesman said in an email. \"Those investigators have also reviewed the Senate Committee’s full report and did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination. This inquiry was extraordinarily thorough and we stand by our previously announced decision not to initiate criminal charges.\" The Senate report, released in December, detailed a program that began soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. An initial memo authorized the CIA with considerable discretion over whom to detain in intelligence-gathering operations. From there, and through subsequent memos, the CIA and U.S. intelligence operations were able to establish secret detention centers. Under the rationale that the combatants captured in the war on terror were not protected as prisoners of war under the Geneva convention, a set of so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding were used to force information from prisoners. The interrogation techniques were discontinued through executive action soon after President Barack Obama took office. The report set off a heated public debate, and critics of the program pointed to scant evidence that the interrogation techniques, which were often characterized as torture, had led to significant, reliable intelligence. Earlier this month, the Senate voted to ban waterboarding and \"rectal feeding,\" which would permanently extend Obama’s executive order. “We must continue to insist that the methods we employ in this fight for peace and freedom must always, always, be as right and honorable as the goals and ideals we fight for,” said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a former of prisoner of war. The torture ban was part of a bigger National Defense Authorization Act that the Senate ultimately passed overwhelmingly. A final version of the bill could be passed in early July.",

    "LabBody": "Martin O'Malley wants the U.S. to accept as many as 13 times the number of Syrian refugees it currently plans to take in. The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "DiffbotBody": "COLUMBIA, SC Active duty personnel at Fort Jackson will be reduced by 180, but the number of job losses for civilian workers remains unclear, a senior member of Congressman Joe Wilson’s staff said Thursday. The number – which amounts to a 6 percent reduction in soldiers – is far fewer than what post officials had anticipated as part of a drastic, 40,000-soldier drawdown by the U.S. Army following 14 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Wilson’s spokeswoman said the congressman is seeking details from Army officials, including how many civilian jobs might be lost. However, whether specifics will come soon, next week or even in September have yet to be determined, the spokeswoman said. Post commander Maj. Gen. Roger Cloutier made his first public remarks about the cutbacks. “The specifics with respect to civilian positions has not been announced,” he said in a post news conference. “I don’t think the final decision has been made so we’ll have to wait and see. “The impact on the Fort Jackson, Columbia, Midlands community will be negligible. We’ll be OK,” he said. “We’ve been anticipating the reductions coming. But that 180 positions represents soldiers and families and we have an obligation to take care of soldiers and families as we go through this process.” The Army-wide cuts will affect the post’s mission, however, Cloutier said. “The thing to remember is as the Army is drawn down, potentially the Army will have to recruit less. And if we have to recruit less, we will have to train less. There could be an impact on the number of soldiers that come through. We really haven’t figured that out yet.” Carl Blackstone, the chief executive of the Greater Columbia Chamber of Commerce, which lobbied strenuously for the post said, “We are grateful that ... Fort Jackson will endure minimal impact over the next several months.” In notable reductions, Fort Benning in Columbus, Ga., will see a net loss of 3,402 soldiers – a 29 percent cut – and Fort Stewart, in Hinesville, Ga., will lose 947 soldiers, a 5 percent reduction. Fort Gordon outside of Augusta, Ga., will lose 41 soldiers, or a 1 percent cutback. Fort Bragg near Fayatteville, N.C., is losing 842 soldiers, a 2 percent reduction. The cuts at Fort Benning, which became public Wednesday, seemed to bode good news for Fort Jackson because the Georgia post has a basic training contingent, albeit much smaller than Columbia’s post. Fort Jackson trains 54 percent of the Army’s soldiers – about 47,000 a year, more than the Army’s three other basic training bases at Benning, Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., and Fort Sill, Okla., combined. Fort Jackson commanders and boosters have said the post has the capacity to absorb the basic training functions of each of the other three posts. Benning provides basic training for infantry; Sill for artillery; and Leonard Wood for military police. The Congressional delegations of states who have seen significant cuts were notified first, according to media reports, and it appeared that those with the highest number of reductions were contacted in descending order. Job cut projections at Fort Jackson, the nation’s largest training base, were as large as 3,100 lost in a worst-case scenario that post commanders planned for beginning last year. On Wednesday, The State newspaper reported the post’s reduction would be as few as 200 military and civilian jobs. Staff Writer Bertram Rantin contributed. Reach Wilkinson at (803) 771-8495. Reach LeBlanc at (803) 771-8308. The Army is reducing the number of soldiers from its ranks over the next two years, a reduction that will affect 30 major installations, according to published reports. An additional 17,000 Army civilian employees also will be laid off under the plan, the report said. The nation’s largest service would drop to 450,000 soldiers by the end of the 2017 budget year from a high of 570,000 during the peak of the fighting in 2008 and 2009. With the end of the ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military is in the process of drastically cutting personnel and budgets. That likely will have profound effects on military installations in the Midlands and the state. For instance, the number of new soldiers trained at Fort Jackson would have dropped to about 17,000 a year from 45,000, former post commander Maj. Gen. Bradley Becker said last fall. Another 27,000 soldiers receiving advanced training in other schools at the post, such as the drill sergeants and chaplains, also would be heavily affected. But despite the apparent loss of 200 jobs in this round of cuts, uncertainty could continue for a year until Congress decides whether to let kick in $1.2 trillion in budget cuts – half to the military, half to domestic spending, called the sequester. If those automatic budget cuts – set to begin in October – take place, the Army would have to slash another 30,000 soldiers, according to published reports. Experts have said that the Army then would not be able to meet its current deployments and be able to ship troops to other regions around the globe. Fort Jackson has already seen some cuts. The U.S. Army’s Recruiting and Retention School and its 92 employees moved in October from Fort Jackson to Fort Knox, Ky. The shift relocated 67 military and 25 civilian workers, and their paychecks, from the post. The fort’s basic training graduations alone draw an an estimated 200,000 people a year who come here from across the nation for three or four days and spend that time eating, drinking, celebrating and visiting Columbia’s sites. Another 50,000 a year come for graduations from the fort’s various other schools, be they chaplains, truck mechanics, drill sergeants or even polygraph analysts. Together, those 250,000 annual visitors pump an estimated $45 million a year in direct spending into the Midlands economy. That’s a big chunk of the fort’s estimated $2 billion a year in overall economic impact, when you consider payroll for the fort’s 7,000 employees, supplies, contractors and other cash flow.",
    "LabBody": "Announced cuts only refer to active-duty military. Cuts to civilian employees haven’t been announced yet. Cuts will affect Fort Jackson’s mission. Fewer recruits means less training.

    "DiffbotBody": "Today, it starts to get really real for the more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants that work for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV). Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue. In years 2016 and 2018, flight attendants would instead get a 3 percent annual bonus, that would subsequently be taxed at 40 percent. And some flight attendants are upset about the new way vacation benefits will be calculated under terms of the proposed contract — a complicated system that will create a more defined two-tier culture of full-time and part-time employees at the airline. The new contract also calls for longer duty day hours for flight attendants in some instances, rising from 10.5 hours to 12 hours — which was not what many flight attendants were hoping to see in a new contract. But even much smaller things in the proposed contract are being viewed as losses by some flight attendants. They include a new provision that requires flight attendants to report for duty 45 minutes before the schedule departure of flights on Southwest's new — and much larger — Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that seats approximately 30 more passengers than the Boeing 737-700 series model. Previously, flight attendants were required to be at the plane 30 minutes before departure. Southwest Airlines is expected to add many more 737-800 aircraft to its fleet starting next year. One truly veteran Southwest Airlines flight attendant who has clocked well over 30 years with the carrier had this to say today after reading through the new proposed contract: \"I have seen enough and compared to our previous contract language to know for certain this is a concessionary contract. Also, even though there is no defined contract language for retroactive pay, it has always been negotiated for our flight attendants going back to the date the contract expired (in 2013 in this instance). There is no retro pay, just a signing bonus (in the proposed contract). The bonus is taxed at 40 percent.\" Other flight attendants I heard from today point the finger directly at Southwest management, including CEO Gary Kelly, for all the angst the new proposed contract is generating among flight attendants as they prepare to vote on it. Noted one flight attendant: \"The negative publicity Gary Kelly is getting in the media is exactly what he wants to sweep under the rug. He thrives on feeling everyone is behind him 100 percent. I really think he has lost contact with the real world.\" A spokesman for Local 556 did not return a call seeking comment today or provide a copy of the tentative contract agreed to by Local 556's executive board and Southwest Airlines management.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The trio of brothers running Sunshine Market in Lynnwood, at the corner of 212th Street SW and 44th Avenue W, are serious about their fruits and vegetables.They stand behind their products, support local farmers and try to be there for their customers nearly every day of the year, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and until 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, said Noor Almtowaq, 29. And they'll stay open later if a customer drives in at closing time, he said.He's the eldest brother and the driving force behind the purchase of the stand, which they opened in September 2013.“Noor's the heart of the entire business,” said 26-year-old Alex.Yet Noor now works at Microsoft, finding time mainly on weekends and some nights for Sunshine Market, and it's Alex who's hooked on produce.“He has so much passion for the business,” said younger brother Josh, 22. “It's like he fell in love with produce.”Alex agreed and said he's not likely to fall out of love anytime soon either. In fact, he's searching for a site for a second, bigger store where he can expand the selection. He dreams of a string of stores offering both conventional and organic produce. He said there's a science to understanding how fruits and vegetables work — “for example, potatoes hate light, bananas love heat, asparagus loves water” — and in understanding how to sell produce.“When you put tomatoes, basil, eggplants and ginger next to each other,” he said, “it's a guarantee you're going to sell them all.”He's always been interested in how things work. Younger brother Josh said Alex was the kind of kid who was forever taking things apart and putting them back together. He studied at Edmonds Community College and earned an engineering degree from the University of Washington, because he wanted to understand the technology behind materials like concrete.“I'm an inventor and my imagination was limited because I didn't understand the materials, so it limited me,” Alex said. Understanding materials “grew my imagination,” he said.The brothers didn't start out planning to go into the produce business.“I didn't even know what cilantro was, to be honest,” Josh said.Prodded by Noor, they were just looking for a business. And they liked the Lynnwood location. Perched on a hilltop at a busy intersection with three corners anchored in Mountlake Terrace, the site overlooks a Lynnwood business district and streets leading to the Alderwood Mall and I-5. It's housed a produce stand at various times in the past, as well as a coffee stand, sometimes both at once. But there were few, if any, improvements to the building and nothing seemed to last for long. That changed when the Almtowaq brothers took over the site. It was Alex who almost singlehandedly rebuilt the building, doing everything the city would let him do by himself. He redid the electrical and plumbing, built the shelves and an awning for shade. He installed new siding and garage doors that can slide up to open an entire side of the building. “He built this whole entire building all by himself,” Josh said. “He's really smart. I used to come down and watch him.”Todd Hall, planning manager for the City of Lynnwood community development, said the brothers made “significant modifications” to the building and their business is apparently running smoothly.“Since they've come in, we haven't had any complaints or anything,” Hall said. “It seems to be going really well.”The brothers said they made a lot of mistakes and their first customers didn't expect Sunshine Market to last long.At first, they didn't have proper coolers and their produce wasn't being sprayed with water to keep it fresh. So Alex installed coolers and bought the software for a state-of-the-art sprinkler system. “My spinach now lasts two weeks,” he said. “I won't leave it in the store two weeks, but it lasts two weeks. When I first opened, I couldn't even get it to last three days.”Customer Kainitra Crammer, who lives in Bothell but works near Sunshine Market, said she loves the freshness of the produce. She can put it in her fruit bowl and it won't attract fruit flies because it's not spoiling right away, she said. “It's not the grocery store's produce,” she said, “and you can clearly tell, because of the way it lasts.”The brothers order from independent local farmers and smaller outfits like Peterson Fruit Co., a family-owned business in Mukilteo. Often it's a customer request that brings a new product into the store. That's how the brothers started carrying raw milk from Jackie's Jersey Milk in Bellingham. They started out selling 18 bottles a week and now sell 90.They also sell fresh goat milk, which is even harder to find; theirs comes from Lucky Hook Farm in Moses Lake.“People drive from like, Arlington and stuff, just to come buy it,” Josh said.They also sell organic eggs from Stiebrs Farms in Yelm, fresh every three days, he said. And duck eggs, which he described as “a very rich egg” beloved by Asians. Another big seller is their raw honey, purchased from a beekeeper with 46 beehives ranging from Mill Creek to Walla Walla, Josh said.“It is like, the best honey out there,” he said, adding, “We believe 110 percent in our honey.”There are also familiar items like chocolate milk from Twin Brooks Creamery in Lynden, coconut water, Bulgarian feta cheese and Beechers Cheese. Other jarred and canned products give a nod to the brothers' Middle Eastern roots. There's olive oil from Lebanon and Tunisia, coriander from Pakistan, Turkish figs, dolmas and cornichons, tahini paste and dates.Although they consider themselves Americans, the brothers fled with their family from Iraq in 1992, in the wake of the first Gulf War. Aided by Red Cross and United Nations workers after crossing into Saudi Arabia, the Almtowaqs made their way to Washington state, living in Everett for a time and then Lynnwood. His family history may explain in part why Alex has studied philosophy and history and seems just as prone to discussing Plato, Socrates and Galileo as he is to talking produce.Indeed, the conversation at Sunshine Market seems to be part of the customer service.“One of the coolest things here is being able to meet with the brothers,” said store regular Doug Clark, maneuvering through the market in his wheelchair. “And since I'm disabled, they actually have excellent customer service.”He's also partial to the produce, he said.“I've gone up to the Yakima fruit stand, just to compare prices and quality,” he said, “and I just turned around and came back here.”Retired media-arts teacher Claire Beach, of Edmonds, called Alex's impassioned explanations his “TED talks,” referring to the short, powerful talks made popular by the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences.She chatted with Alex on a recent visit, but that didn't distract her from the produce, which she said has helped her recover from a serious illness. She's been following an anti-inflammatory diet, including cutting down on carbs, and has lost 40 pounds and regained her vigor, she said.“This is the first time in my life I'm eating what my body wants,” said Beach, adding that she grew up in the South. “I was raised in Betty Crocker Land.”Customers like Beach are inspiring, Alex said.“When people come back and they tell you they feel better, healthier, stronger — it's a good feeling,” he said. “It keeps you going.”He could be making a lot more money as an engineer, but said he doesn't like sitting behind a desk.“Engineering is a hobby,” he said. “It's something I do because I love it.“But selling produce is different. You're selling something that feeds the entire world.”",

Although they're certainly not a popular choice, ducks make fun and unique pets. Ducks don't have the reputation for it, but they are intelligent, playful and cuddly. They enjoy playing with toys and can be trained to engage in easy games. Their feed is also relatively cheap, and they are also quite the weed eaters. However, like with any other pet, it's important to consider the commitment a duck requires. Different breeds of ducks have different amounts of energy. They also need to be sheltered from predators, such as foxes, dogs or even cats.",

Kelsey Schwenker, library aide at the Millard Library, suggests a book that features a music student whose summer job turns out to be dangerously deceptive. “City of Dark Magic” by Magnus Flyte. This novel involves the mysterious city of Prague, a music student helping to catalog Beethoven’s manuscripts and the suicide (or possible murder) of her mentor. With intrigue, romance and music. What more could you want? Aura Sewell, library specialist at the Abrahams Library, listens to music in a new way thanks to her pick. “Bug Music: How Insects Gave Us Rhythm and Noise” by David Rothenberg. You don’t need to be a bug or music expert to enjoy “Bug Music.” The author’s passion for the topic is contagious. I never realized how many sounds I have been ignoring. Mark Sorensen, library specialist at W. Dale Clark Library, recommends books that explore connections made through music. “The Hum and the Shiver” by Alex Bledsoe. Pvt. Bronwyn Hyatt returns home from Iraq to the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee wounded in body and mind. She’s lost her connection to the songs of her kinfolk and gained a spectral “haint” that warns of tragedy to come. This is a totally unique contemporary fantasy — a love song to Appalachian music and folklore, richly layered, sexy, with a touch of the supernatural dancing just under the mandolin strings. “Bel Canto” by Ann Patchett. A world-class operatic diva, a Japanese millionaire, a youthful translator and a rebel soldier are thrown together in a South American villa when a coup attempt becomes a protracted hostage crisis. Dreamlike, hilarious and heartbreaking, this novel explores the power of music to unite us across languages and battle lines. Patchett modeled the heroine on soprano Renee Fleming. Read along with an album of her singing to complete the experience. Copyright ©2015 Omaha World-Herald. All rights reserved.

    "DiffbotBody": "The attorney for the parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, said the decision not to prosecute the veteran sergeant seemed “preordained.” Mawuli Davis, the Thomases’ layer, said the investigation into the March 24 shooting was tightly controlled from start to finish by Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds, who presented his findings Thursday to a grand jury that concluded Sgt. Kenneth Owens’ use of deadly force was justified. “There has not been a level of transparency,” as Reynolds promised, Davis said. Felicia Thomas, mother of Nicholas Thomas, speaks as her son Triston “TJ” Thomas comforts her during a press conference at Davis Bozeman Law Firm in Decatur on Friday. The parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, felt “disrespected and discouraged” by the process that culminated Thursday with a grand jury’s recommendation not to prosecute the veteran sergeant, the family’s lawyer said. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM Nicholas Thomas’ mother said she learned Owens would not face charges on television, “the same way I found out my son was” killed. Davis blasted the Cobb D.A. for meeting with the media Thursday before reaching out to his clients. “Rather than have a private meeting with the family, they had a private meeting with the media,” said Davis, adding the Thomases felt “disrespected” by Reynolds. Felicia Thomas, mother of Nicholas Thomas, speaks as her son Triston “TJ” Thomas comforts her during a press conference at Davis Bozeman Law Firm in Decatur on Friday. The parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, felt “disrespected and discouraged” by the process that culminated Thursday with a grand jury’s recommendation not to prosecute the veteran sergeant, the family’s lawyer said. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM “This is an absolute effort to control messaging,” he said. And the message delivered to reporters was not altogether factual, said Davis, noting that a press release announcing the grand jury’s decision stated that Smyrna and Cobb police “attempted to arrest Mr. Thomas on a felony probation violation warrant.” Thomas was actually being sought for a probation violation stemming from a conviction on a misdemeanor charge of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana. Davis said he is eager to find out what evidence was presented to the grand jury. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has submitted an open-records request and was informed it would receive the entire case file sometime next week. Of particular interest will be any information explaining why Owens felt compelled to shoot. Of the five officers dispatched to the Cumberland Parkway Goodyear, where Thomas worked, Owens was the only one to draw his gun. Thomas tried to elude the officers, jumping into a customer’s Maserati, a detail neither side disputes. With the only exit blocked by police, Thomas drove around the building twice. Owens told investigators he shot at the Maserati because he feared Thomas was going to run over an officer who was behind him. It’s a different narrative than the one provided immediately after the shooting, when Smyrna police told reporters Owens shot at Thomas to save himself. Davis said it’s no coincidence Owens’ story changed after it was revealed the fatal bullet entered through Thomas’ back. Co-counsel Rob Bozeman said he wants to know whether that other officer feared for his safety and, if so, why he didn’t feel the need to draw his gun. “It seems obvious that officer could’ve defended his own life,” Bozeman said. The Thomases’ lawyers said they have notified Smyrna police and Owens of their intent to file civil litigation. Felicia Thomas said she will continue to pursue justice for her son, who left behind a young daughter. “God has the last word, not Vic Reynolds,” she said.",

What’s Happening: The Error on Dylann Roof's Background Check The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans.

A close look at the period in the past 40 years when living standards did improve, in the second half of the 1990s, reveals that the improvement was driven by a (temporary) pause in healthcare cost inflation. When the cost of employee benefits rises more slowly, employee pay can rise more quickly.

The figures also show that on average, Valley commuters have some of the shortest travel times to get to work compared to their counterparts in other parts of the state, largely — but not entirely — without the gridlock that can turn freeways into parking lots in California’s larger urban center. The region enjoys those shorter commutes even as the number of drivers grows faster than new roads are being built. And through it all, the region’s highways, streets and roads are being subjected to an ever-increasing pounding. In Fresno County, for example, less than 200 miles of new roads were built between 2000 and 2013, according to the California Department of Transportation. But during the same 13-year span, the number of vehicle miles piled up by drivers in the county grew from 19.3 million to almost 23 million — a whopping 19% increase. All those miles add up to additional wear and tear on roads that cities, counties and Caltrans are hard-pressed to maintain. Maintenance challenge “Our biggest challenge isn’t capital construction of brand new roads,” said Scott Mozier, Fresno’s public works director. “Pavement condition is the big challenge.” Most new roads are built to last about 20 years before they need to be resurfaced, and in between they need to have a coat of slurry seal every seven to 10 years, he said. But in recent years, both roads and the budgets to maintain them have deteriorated, forcing managers to postpone a significant number of street maintenance and repair projects. “This year in the budget discussions, we told the City Council that it requires an average investment of about $22 million a year just to maintain our pavement in the condition it’s in now,” Mozier said. In the 2014-15 budget year, the city’s share of state, federal and local funds available for road maintenance add up to $11 million — about half of what is needed “just to keep running in place.” As a result, there are “more streets that should have been slurry sealed and are ultimately at risk of failing,” Mosier said. And that’s on top of other deferred road maintenance that, if the city were to try to catch up over the next five years, would require about $224 million. Road quality is measured on something called a pavement condition index (PCI) on a range from 0 to 100. An index score of 71 or higher indicates good average road conditions; anything below that shows that roads are at some level of risk for failure. A road-needs assessment issued last fall by a consortium of city and county transportation agencies statewide reported that across the Valley, PCI scores range from the 60s in Fresno, Tulare and Kings counties — where the average road conditions are estimated to be at lower risk — to 47, or poor condition, in Madera County. Among California’s 58 counties, only five had average PCI scores above 70. “What we’re facing here isn’t just a Fresno issue,” Mozier said. “It’s a state issue and a national issue over the condition of our infrastructure.” The U.S. Department of Transportation reported this week that 65% of the nation’s roads are in less-than-ideal shape. In California, the federal agency added, 68% of roads are in either poor or mediocre condition. Statewide, the cost to make up for the maintenance backlog on roads, overpasses, ramps and bridges is estimated at more than $78 billion over the next decade. Commuter habits In Fresno and the Valley, most of the roadway wear and tear is likely being rolled up by solo commuters. In Fresno County, the number of people alone behind the wheel on their way to and from work grew from about 218,800 in 2000 to more than 278,400 in 2013 — an increase of more than 27%. In neighboring Tulare County, where the numbers aren’t as large, the growth is even more pronounced: about 94,300 solo commuters in 2000 to almost 124,600 in 2013, or an increase of almost 32%. Not surprisingly, people who drive their own vehicle to work also reported the shortest average commute times in Fresno and Tulare counties: about 20 minutes. “We are blessed here to have the mobility that we have,” said Tony Boren, executive director of the Fresno County Council of Governments, a panel of city and county government representatives who deal with countywide transportation and planning issues. “People can get around this county and this region like most folks in the state can’t, and we take it for granted because we’ve always had it.” Boren noted that with a few rush-hour exceptions on Fresno’s freeways and surface streets, traffic manages to flow pretty smoothly. “But I have a friend who lives in the Bay Area who says if you hit some of those freeways at the wrong time, just forget it,” he said. “You’re going to burn two hours just sitting there.” Mozier said that on a congestion-grading scale of A to F, “the city’s historic level-of-service policy goal is a D.” While a D grade on a student’s report card is a bad thing, “a D is actually a pretty good level of service in terms of people’s expectations on traffic congestion,” Mozer said. “What that means is that during peak traffic periods, we can clear the traffic on each approach” to a stop light on surface streets, he added. Commuting is more of an ordeal for those who ride the bus. In Fresno and Tulare counties, only about 1% of commuters use public transit — buses or trolleys — to get to work, and it took them a whole lot longer than if they’d driven, according to the Associated Press figures derived from the U.S. Census Bureau. In Tulare County, the average commute time for public transit riders was about double that of solo drivers, at about 39 minutes. In Fresno County, which boasts a more robust transit system within the Fresno-Clovis urban area, the average ride to work on public transit was more than 53 minutes. Fourteen of California’s 18 largest metropolitan areas had a greater percentage of commuters using public transportation than Fresno County. The average was just over 3%, and the proportions were highest in the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward area at more than 16%, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim at almost 6%, and San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara at more than 4%. The Bay Area communities have extensive bus and train services, including BART and Caltrain, while the Los Angeles Basin includes Metro subway and bus services and Metrolink commuter trains. Boren said his agency realizes that Fresno County lags in public transit. “We recognize the need to facilitate a shift from streets and roads to other modes of transportation,” he said. “But that’s easier said than done, because we have land-use patterns that are auto-centric. The Fresno-Clovis urban area is served by a half-mile street grid system that is built for cars.” Measure C, a half-cent sales tax to support transportation improvements, is an example of that recognition. When voters first approved it in 1986, all of the money raised was directed to streets and roads. “When the voters renewed it in 2006, 25% was directed to transit,” Boren said. “We can do what we can to encourage people to use public transit or alternative modes,” he added. “The folks who run FAX (Fresno Area Xpress, the city bus system) are doing a great job, doing the best they can. But if you have a job and it takes three times as long to take the bus to get to work, in a world where everything is ‘go, go, go,’ people just can’t afford to blow three times as much time on a bus.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "The world is sometimes a difficult place, and sometimes while we suffer in darkness, we wonder if God has left us alone. When you find yourself questioning if God has abandoned you, remember these seven important comforting truths. Difficulties and trials are a part of every traveler's journey in life. Sometimes they make us and other times they break us and piece us together into something different. Either way, we come out of these difficulties a different person than we were when we went in. That is the nature of trials. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Some may turn to God in their difficulties, but what happens when we feel that God has abandoned us and forced us to face the darkness alone? Here are seven things to remember when you feel like God has abandoned you. God loves you God is your father, and He loves you with a love that is perfect and unending. You can trust in that. Because you are His child, He cares for you, watches over you, protects you and even mourns with you. We are put here in families with parents so we can understand the bond between parent and child. That love is only a fraction of the love your Heavenly Father feels for you. In the scriptures we are told that charity never faileth. Charity is pure love, and God's love will never fail you. Learn to love Him too so you can more fully feel His love around you. Sometimes a good cry is necessary Sometimes the anger and hate of the world is so painful that we harden our hearts so we can't feel the pain. The trouble with closing our hearts to pain is that once it's closed, love is also locked out. A good cry can help fix what sometimes needs to be broken. The pain and sorrow of a broken heart leaves spaces that God can fill –- that you can feel. A broken heart allows you to cry over the pain and sorrow of your trials, and allows God's love to heal the broken parts. In order for you to know God is there, you have to be able to feel His presence. God will come to you if you ask Often when we feel abandoned, the last thing we want to do is talk to the one who we feel has betrayed us. When it comes to God, however, the best thing you can do is talk to Him and tell Him how you feel. As your father, He wants to hear from you as often as you are willing to let Him be a part of your life. Not only will God listen to every prayer you speak, but He will come to you every time you ask for Him. He may not answer every prayer exactly the way you would like Him to, and He may not answer them immediately, but He will sit with you and comfort you while you wait. If you want God to walk with you, it's important that you talk to Him. Just ask. God sees the end from the beginning Because we are small human beings in a big world, we are so limited in our ability to see beyond what's right in front of us. God, on the other hand, is a supreme being, the creator of the universe, and more importantly, the creator of us. He knows where you're broken and where you need mending. He also knows the experiences needed to heal you. Each trial is part of the perfecting process so when we stand before Him, we can be our best selves. We do not see what He sees nor can we know what He knows. What we can do is trust that each experience He gives us is given to help us grow, to give us experience and to point us in the direction we need to go. Trust Him. God is a God of goodness Everything that is good comes from God. By the same token, everything that comes from God is good, even the hard things. If God is asking you to walk a certain path, know that it is for your good, for your better understanding and for your learning. God wouldn't require you to do something that was going to damage your soul. He is a God that desires to lift you up and make you better than you are. Sometimes, it is our own choices that put us in situations that are dangerous. When you find yourself in any situation that is not good, get out! God will not be there. God is a God of goodness and you will find Him in places of light. If you want to find God, look for those places of light and walk there. We're not meant to suffer alone Isolation can cause loneliness, discouragement and depression. It can rob people of their hope, their will and their self-worth. Trusted friends, on the other hand, can encourage, support, and ground us. They can guide us through troubled waters, offer a hand to hold and cheer us up when our hearts are heavy. A trusted friend can remind us of who we are and where we want to be. Some have been where we are before and can give us a far better perspective on how to travel safely to the other side. A good friend is God's way of sending an angel. Read: 4 reasons atheists and Christians both need to be extremely concerned about this new study God never abandons His children God is a God of love and a God of light. He is also our true father, a father who will never abandon His children. Although the world's fathers may, at times, fail their children, God is perfect and will never ever fail you. You are his precious, beautiful child and although He may at times test you, He will never, ever forsake you. Of this promise you can be sure. Believe in Him and keep moving forward.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The streets surrounding Chukchansi Park were eerily quiet early Friday afternoon, but within a few hours were taken over by thousands of soccer enthusiasts, eager to witness the oldest rivalry in the history of the Mexican league make a stop in Fresno. First came the vendors, lining the streets by 4 p.m., hawking jerseys, flags, shirts, bandanas, scarves, Lucha Libre masks, noisemakers and more. Shortly thereafter, the fans followed en masse, with the lines to get into the park overflowing into Fulton Mall and surrounding streets ahead of the exhibition between Chivas de Guadalajara and Club Atlas. Though 1,800 miles away from the teams’ hometown of Guadalajara, the Clásico Tapatío was alive and well in Fresno. They bring their sports and passions with them and it plays out on a day like this. An announced crowd of 16,821 finally made its way in, setting a stadium record, while another 11,000 joined online via livestream — all of them treated to a tightly fought scoreless draw that spurred a nonstop celebration through the night. The previous stadium record of 16,125 was set in 2012 when Club America played Chiapas. Official fan clubs from Las Vegas and Los Angeles helped boost Friday’s crowd, with Club Atlas supporters nestled into the northeast corner of the stadium and a rowdy Chivas section in right field. Though there were no goals, the atmosphere stayed on full throttle for the full 90 minutes. 16,125 Previous mark, set in 2012 when Club America played Chiapas Fans cheered at plays made by Chivas forwards Omar Bravo and Miguel Ponce. Atlas fans got their chance to raise the decibel level on big saves from goalkeeper Miguel Pinto. And along with the cheering, there was singing and dancing in the aisles. Among those on hand was Carlos Ruiz, who lives in Parlier but was born in Guadalajara. Ruiz and his son Jesus try to come to all of the Mexican League friendlies, but Friday by far rated as their favorite. “(Chivas) is my team,” Ruiz said while brandishing a faded tattoo of Guadalajara’s team crest. “It’s not every day you have the chance to watch your favorite team.” Ruiz and his son could consider themselves part of the majority, with what appeared to be more than 80% of the crowd clad in Chivas’ red-and-white stripes. Jaime and Jessica Lopez, a husband and wife duo, didn’t mind. They proudly donned Club Atlas’ black-and-red jerseys. The Lopezes made the drive from Fowler to catch their Zorros. “Atlas is the best team,” Jaime Lopez said in Spanish while pumping his fist, indirectly returning some trash talk from Chivas fans a few rows above. For nearly everyone in the stadium, it was about much more than the rivalry or even the sport itself. The match also brought a piece of their native Guadalajara to the central San Joaquin Valley. “Coming here is great, the atmosphere is so alive,” Lopez said. “It almost feels like we’re back home in Mexico.” The match also drew community leaders, including Fresno County Supervisor Henry Perea. “It's always great to bring the community together,” Perea said. “You’ll find people from all different parts of Mexico that have relocated to Fresno County. They bring their sports and passions with them and it plays out on a day like this.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J. She began working for museums in earnest in 2002 when she became administrator of the Readington museums, where she oversaw three 18th-century buildings depicting Colonial life in New Jersey farming communities. Hollander helped with several restoration efforts and spent a great deal of her time making history accessible to the public. She developed Hands-on History programs centered on themes such as health and hygiene in the Colonial era and traditional crafts such as barrel-making. She would also take on the persona of Vrouw Maritje Bouman, a 36-year-old mother of five in the Colonial era. Donning a white bonnet, embroidered apron and red linen bedjacket, Hollander would tell school groups what life was like in 1755 as she performed daily chores. \"I would show them that I was cooking on a hearth and ask them if they help their moms cook on a hearth,\" she recalled. \"They would say we don't have a hearth. We have a stove. I would ask them what is it? How did it get hot? Wood? Most didn't know, but by asking them questions, if forced them to think about their world.\" Hollander played the part so seriously that a student once stopped her on the street to tell her she looked just like Vrouw Bouman and ask if she was her descendant. \"She got the kids to appreciate history,\" said Margaret Smith, program director at Readington. Hollander kept their attention, she said, through hands-on activities and stories. Hollander left Readington in 2010 when the board made her job part-time and soon after started working at Clinton's Red Mill Village. With 40,000 artifacts and a 10-acre campus along the scenic south branch of the Raritan River, the mill is well suited for exhibits and special events. Hollander tapped that potential, hosting Civil War Days and Revolutionary Days, weekend festivals that featured re-enactors. She also got a quick lesson in crisis management there. The Halloween before she was hired, the nonprofit that runs the mill had transformed the historic spot to the Asylum of Terror, haunted by \"wretched souls\" tormented by \"dementia, paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviors, physical abnormalities and deformities.\" The theme drew criticism from the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma and prompted the National Alliance on Mental Illness to alert the public about the Clinton mill. Mill officials approved a safer \"zombie\" theme the year Hollander came on board and issued a public apology in the newspaper. The board would have left it at that had it not been for Hollander, said Pat Bower, a former mill board member. Hollander reached out to the alliance and the council, creating a history exhibit on how the state had treated the mentally ill. \"She used it as an opportunity to highlight the issue and engage public discussion,\" Bower said. Hollander said some didn't want the exhibit to include the state's mistreatment of the mentally ill and the prejudices held against people with mental illness. But Hollander was insistent that a full story be told, and that the mill was the right place to tell it. \"You can't learn to do things right if you don't recognize the things that happened in the past,\" she said. Hollander left Clinton three years ago for a job as assistant director of communications and outreach at the New Jersey regional office at American Jewish Committee, an advocacy nonprofit. There, she said, she learned about building connections with people and partnerships to advance a cause. Considering just a third of the National Museum of Industrial History's budget will be covered by museum tickets, she said building partnerships — in the form of sponsors, grants and memberships — will be key. She also learned at AJC that history is more significant to people if you can show its impact on people today. She believes she can do that at the National Museum of Industrial History by showing how the machines and innovations that built America continue to have an impact on the world. And here, she'll also have an opportunity to develop programs that inspire the next generation. \"That's where the truly, truly open minds are,\" Hollander said. \"To them, the sky's the limit, anything can happen.\" It takes, she said, just one historical figure, artifact or idea to inspire a future. Just as Grover's Mill did for her.

The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Forgiving isn’t easy. However, if you know, and understand, the principles of Christianity, and you try to live based on those tenets, it’s something you must do. The recent shootings in Charleston, where nine churchgoers were killed, has pulled emotional reactions from most people – whether you’re a person of faith or not. But, as Christians, we’ve had to face the mandate to forgive Dylann Roof. The mandate was put in the spotlight when the families of Daniel Simmons, Ethel Lance and Myra Thompson stood in the courtroom mere days after the slayings, looked Roof in the face and forgave him. I’m not sure I could have done that – at that moment. However, I understand where their grace and strength came from. I was raised in the Missionary Baptist Church and had strong ties, through my mother, to the AME Zion Church. I’ve never heard those church leaders equivocate on the issue of forgiveness. I’ve listened to them in Bible study as they created hypothetical events of wrongdoing. I heard the strenuous, and at times heated, debates. Then I’ve heard the leaders end the discussion by saying “you must forgive.” The killings and subsequent reactions have given many of us a life-lasting challenge. If you believe in God, and are a follower of a faith based on the teachings of Jesus, or if you label yourself a Christian, then you must forgive. From Sunday school as a child and into adulthood, these scriptures have echoed: Romans 12:19: “Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’ says the Lord.” Matthews 18: 21-22: “Then Peter came and said to Him, ‘Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?’ Jesus said to him, ‘I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven…’” I can’t say I’ve always trusted or lived up to that concept. Fact is, there have been times I failed so badly that it’s embarrassing to admit. But the teachings, from my parents and those old deacons, gave me a standard. That standard is that we absolutely forgive, and not cry for justice as a veiled quest for revenge. Obviously, family members of the Charleston victims understood that standard. They’ve firmly held to it. If they can do it, that gives us no excuse. We all must be forgiving – daily. Failure to do that puts us on a path we’ve seen all too often – more wars, more violence, more senseless killing.",

    "DiffbotBody": "While being single may seem difficult, we can find happiness in the dating process as we improve ourselves and our outlook on life. Last year, it was reported that single people in America now outnumber married people. There are many theories and ideas about why this is. One might think that it would be easier to find a soul mate because of online dating sites, but it seems that this has changed our millennial mindset, making us pickier than ever. Read: The most overlooked characteristic of who you want to marry The research group Euromonitor even predicts that by 2020, there will be 48 million new single residents, an uptick of over 20 percent of the current number. Notwithstanding, many of us still crave companionship, a void that nothing else in life can seem to fill. The dating game can be exhausting and frustrating, especially when we experience repeated breakups, which causes real, actual grief. Once this grief is properly addressed, which can include therapy, we still may be left asking ourselves, \"Why am I still single?\" My experience has shown me that usually it's not other people; it's me who needs to change. When I say this, I don't mean that we need to change who we are; rather, change what we're doing and why we're doing it. 1. Make it a matter of prayer Communing with God to better understand His plan for you can help you find peace in a brutal world. Consider that God's ways are higher than ours; He has a plan for each of us. God wants us to talk with Him. By putting Him at the forefront of our dating lives, asking Him questions, and turning to holy scripture for answers, we'll perhaps find some of the answers to why we haven't married yet. God does want us to marry, have families and learn to become like Him. Seek His guidance in what it will take to get to that point. 2. Meet as many people as possible Years ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a goal to go on dates with 50 girls. I remember exclaiming that was a lot. He then told me that he wanted to go out with as many people as possible to learn what he did and didn't like. He kept a journal of these dates, and started to notice a consistent theme in his preferences. My friend never made it to his goal of 50, because along the way, he met his wife. By the time she came along, it was apparent to my friend that this wonderful woman would make an excellent companion. He moved quickly and asked her to marry him. She accepted, and they have a wonderful life and a cute little boy. From this experience, it's apparent that putting ourselves out there will broaden our opportunities. If my friend hadn't been going places where he knew he could meet quality girls, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet and date his wife. Use every avenue possible to put yourself in front of people. As you are out there, remember that you may get rejected from time to time. That's OK. Take those experiences, learn from them, then move on to meeting more people. If you follow this pattern, you'll find rejection happens less and less. 3. Make a list of qualities you find attractive Also, make a list of things that aren't attractive to you. From these two lists, pick three things you absolutely must have, three things you absolutely can't stand and then discard the rest. No one is perfect, so simply focus on the values and attributes in a person that are most important to you. Finally, make a third list, but make it about you. What do you need to do to be deserving of this ideal mate? Only you can answer these questions, but seeking out the advice of family and close friends in this regard will help you narrow down your best and worst qualities. From this final list, make any necessary changes in your personal behavior, and hold yourself accountable to someone (such as a parent or best friend) to measure your progess. During this time, it's important that you keep dating, because this will give you realtime feedback about your improvements. 4. Be kind and stay positive Kindness goes a long way, especially in the dating realm. This isn't to say that you should go on a pity date with everyone who shows interest; rather, politely declining an invitation in a kind way will do a lot for your personal self worth, and it will make it easier to stay within your preferences. Read: 10 signs you’re in the right relationship Staying positive can be tough, especially if it's been a while since you've been in a relationship, but focus on the good things in your life. Keep your friends and family close; exercise; read; expand your hobbies and talents. Eventually, for most of us, the right person does come along. Until then, if you are the very best person you can be, you can find happiness in the single life.

    "DiffbotBody": "SEATTLE — No woulda/coulda/shoulda laments Friday night from the Seattle Mariners. This was a simple beatdown administered by the Los Angeles Angels, who hit four home runs in a 7-3 romp at Safeco Field. C.J. Cron and Mike Trout each went deep twice, one apiece against starter Mike Montgomery and reliever Danny Farquhar. “We didn’t give ourselves much of a chance tonight,” manager Lloyd McClendon admitted. “The long ball hurt us.” The Mariners, meanwhile, followed up Thursday’s 19-hit deluge by mustering little against Angels lefty Hector Santiago after scratching across one run in the first inning. “He spotted up really well,” right fielder MarkTrumbo said, “and he had a lot of movement, too. You had to cover a lot of area.” The Angels carried a 7-1 lead into the ninth inning before Trumbo’s two-run homer tightened the score. It meant little on this night; going forward…who knows? “It felt pretty good,” Trumbo said, “but you’ve got to keep going. Hopefully, it’s one of many. The cliche is I’m not trying to do too much, but that’s pretty much what it is right now.” Montgomery (4-3) was probably overdue for regression after compiling a magnificent 1.62 ERA over his first seven career starts and yielding just one run in 26 1/3 innings over his previous three outings. Trout supplied the statistical correction with a three-run bomb in the third inning. Cron then opened with fourth with a homer for a 4-1 lead. “I was trying to go up and in (to Trout),” Montgomery said, “and it ended up down and in. He likes the ball down there. That home run was the difference-maker. “The other (homer by Cron) was a first-pitch fastball.” Montgomery pitched out a two-on, no-out jam in the fifth that stemmed from an off-line throw and a booted grounder but exited after David Freese’s leadoff single in the sixth. In came Farquhar, who needed to be bailed out Thursday after inheriting a six-run lead in the ninth inning. That was after being recalled earlier in the day from Triple-A Tacoma. This wasn’t much better. Cron hit Farquhar’s first pitch over the right-center wall, and the Angels led 6-1. That closed the book on Montgomery at five runs and eight hits in five-plus innings. The book remained open, though, on Farquhar, who surrendered a leadoff homer to Trout in the seventh. “The pitch to Cron wasn’t very good,” Farquhar said, “but the pitch to Trout was right where I wanted it. It was a fastball up and away….Look at the video. It would have smacked (Mike) Zunino’s glove. “It didn’t there.” Santiago (6-4) gave up three hits in the first inning but limited the damage to one run by stranding runners at second and third. Thereafter, he never permitted more than one runner in any inning before exiting after seven. “That might have been the best game he’s pitched all year,” Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. “The first-pitch strikes were off the chart…Everything he wanted to do he did…really it was a terrific job.” Trevor Gott worked a scoreless eighth before Vinnie Pestano served up Trumbo’s two-run bomb in the ninth. That brought Fernando Salas into the game of the final three outs. Montgomery worked around a jam in the first inning after Kole Calhoun grounded a one-out single past first baseman Jesus Montero and went to third on Trout’s single to right. Calhoun broke for home on Albert Pujols’ grounder to third and ran into the second out. Erick Aybar ended the inning with a grounder to third. The Mariners then hustled their way to a 1-0 lead later in the inning but missed a crooked-number opportunity. Franklin Gutierrez punched a one-out single through the right side and went to second on Robinson Cano’s fly to deep center. Nelson Cruz produced the run with a hard ground single up the middle. Cruz went to third on Kyle Seager’s double into the right-center gap, but the Mariners stranded both runners when Mark Trumbo popped out. Montgomery’s escapability ended in the third after Johnny Giavotella pulled a one-out double to left. Montgomery then hit Calhoun with a pitch before Trout crushed a 91-mph fastball for a three-run homer. Distance: 427 feet to center. Result: Angels led 3-1. It was downhill from there. bob.dutton@thenewstribune.com blog.thenewstribune.com/mariners @TNT_Mariners",

    "DiffbotBody": "Washington's NFL team already knows what its next move is to protect its trademark: appeal to a higher court. But what it's doing and what it should be doing, according to at least one crisis communications expert, may be at odds. Daniel G. Hill, president of Ervin-Hill Strategy in D.C., said his advice to the team and owner Dan Snyder is to \"rip off the Band-Aid'' after U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of the Washington NFL team's federal trademark registrations. \"The team is in a difficult spot,'' said Hill. \"At some point, they are going to have to stop fighting it. The problem with these kinds of issues, race issues and things like that, is you can have great facts on your side. Dan Snyder can do polls of Native Americans and others who support the current name, but you only have to offend a small group for it not to work.'' Ervin-Hill, in the crisis communications side of its public relations business, works with athletes and sports teams, among others, when tricky situations arise. Hill wouldn't name specific clients on the crisis side for confidentiality reasons; Ervin-Hill also works with athletes through the company's Pro Impact service, which consults and advises on image branding (professional boxer Heather \"the Heat\" Hardy is one Pro Impact client). Hill said Washington's NFL team will likely eventually be forced — for financial or other reasons — to change the team's nickname and Hill doesn't see the social pressure letting up any time soon, even as the team has vowed to forge ahead in the court system, and its next step is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. How would Hill handle it? \"The way I like to tackle these things is if I know eventually I have to do something, I do it more immediately, even if it doesn’t fit with what I want or what my client wants,'' said Hill. \"If they eventually have to change the name they should get it out of the way. This is sports; you’re not going to lose your fans. The Wizards are as popular today as they were when they were the Bullets. \"[The team] is treating this like a mundane legal matter. Arguing the name is historic doesn't really do anything in light of what's happening in the country. The name has color and 'skin' in it. And those two things, right now more than ever in the last 50 years, we need to get away from. Them fighting it at this particular moment makes absolutely no sense.\" If the team continues to fight, via the appeals process — the case would be heard by a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit. and it must file within 30 days of Wednesday's ruling — it will be a lengthy battle. Jesse A. Witten, the lead attorney for the Native Americans fighting the trademark fighting the team over the team’s trademark protections, said the appeals process could take 18 months \"plus or minus a few months\" to play out. If the team loses and wants to appeal, it would have to go to the Supreme Court, which picks and chooses the cases it hears.",

Hill, president of Ervin-Hill Strategy in D.C., said his advice to the team and owner Dan Snyder is to \"rip off the Band-Aid'' after U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of the Washington NFL team's federal trademark registrations. \"The team is in a difficult spot,'' said Hill. \"At some point, they are going to have to stop fighting it. The problem with these kinds of issues, race issues and things like that, is you can have great facts on your side. Dan Snyder can do polls of Native Americans and others who support the current name, but you only have to offend a small group for it not to work.'' Ervin-Hill, in the crisis communications side of its public relations business, works with athletes and sports teams, among others, when tricky situations arise. Hill wouldn't name specific clients on the crisis side for confidentiality reasons; Ervin-Hill also works with athletes through the company's Pro Impact service, which consults and advises on image branding (professional boxer Heather \"the Heat\" Hardy is one Pro Impact client). Hill said Washington's NFL team will likely eventually be forced — for financial or other reasons — to change the team's nickname and Hill doesn't see the social pressure letting up any time soon, even as the team has vowed to forge ahead in the court system, and its next step is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. How would Hill handle it? \"The way I like to tackle these things is if I know eventually I have to do something, I do it more immediately, even if it doesn’t fit with what I want or what my client wants,'' said Hill. \"If they eventually have to change the name they should get it out of the way. This is sports; you’re not going to lose your fans. The Wizards are as popular today as they were when they were the Bullets.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A TV show named \"Gunsmoke\" made its debut, and another named \"Make Room for Daddy\" won two Emmys. Elvis Presley and Pat Boone had young hearts all shook up, and for the first time, they could listen to those crooners and others on a new gadget called a pocket transistor radio. A new car cost $1,900, gasoline was 23 cents a gallon and rents averaged $87 a month. It was 1955. On July 17 of that year — a year in which the last occupying troops left Austria and the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series — Disneyland opened its doors. If the first day was any indicator of its future, we might have expected Walt Disney's amusement park to fade into oblivion, much like Georgia Gibbs' No. 1 Billboard hit \"Dance With Me Henry\" did. (Quick, hum a few bars.) The chaos of Disneyland's debut played out in front of a national television audience, and predictions of epic failure abounded. Sixty years later, we know how wrong those naysayers were. With nearly 17 million annual visitors, Disneyland is the biggest draw in California and among the top tourist destinations in the world. The park's drawing power persuaded Disney to build theme parks in Florida, France, Japan and China. Other amusement parks, such as Denmark's Tivoli Gardens, existed, but Disneyland established a modern theme-park template that has been often duplicated but rarely matched. We think we know Disneyland; after all, we've had 60 years to get acquainted. But do we really? Reporters Christopher Reynolds and Brady MacDonald have compiled a list of 60 things you might not know on the diamond anniversary of the theme park that became the gold standard. 1. Much of Disneyland is built to scale to create the illusion of a full-scale experience. The trains circling the park and the Mark Twain Riverboat are built to 5/8 scale. Sleeping Beauty Castle and the storefronts on Main Street, U.S.A., use forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller. 2. More than a million corn dogs are sold annually at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park. L.A. Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold calls the Disneyland corn dog the best he's ever had. 3. The Rivers of America in Frontierland is 4 to 8 feet deep. The first time the man-made river was filled in 1955, the water seeped through the sandy soil. The riverbed was eventually lined with clay to prevent leaking. 4. The Rivers of America held 6.16 million gallons of water the first time it was filled and lost 30,000 gallons a day to evaporation. 5. Maintenance crews dump 12 pounds of green or brown dye into the water a couple of times a week to color the river. 6. The 8- to 15-foot-tall berm that surrounds Disneyland was designed to keep out the real world and keep in the fantasy world. The dirt for the berm came from the excavation of the Rivers of America. Some of the 350,000 cubic yards of excavated dirt was also used to create what would become Tom Sawyer Island. 7. The Disney family crest can be found over the entrance to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The coat of arms was placed above the arch in 1965, about a year before Walt Disney's death. 8. About 84 million Mickey Mouse ears have been sold since 1955. The Mouseketeers first wore the hats in the 1950s on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television show. 9. More than 750 million people have visited Disneyland since opening day. It took just seven weeks for the first million visitors to walk through the gates. Attendance was 3.6 million in 1955-56, its first year of operation. 10. More than 50 scuba divers maintain the water-based attractions and waterways at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. 11. Dream of getting married in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle? You can, but it will set you back $120,000 for an after-hours ceremony. A trip in Cinderella's crystal coach is included, but if you want Mickey and Minnie Mouse to attend, it will cost you an additional $1,425 for a 30-minute visit. 12. Disneyland has a \"jail\" for disruptive guests (Disney-speak for visitors). They're typically held in a security office until Anaheim police arrive. Undercover Disney security officers have been known to watch for shoplifters. 13. No gum is sold at Disney theme parks. Walt Disney didn't want visitors to step in discarded chewing gum. 14. A small lamp remains lighted in the window above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., in memory of Walt Disney. He often stayed overnight in the 500-square-foot apartment during construction of Disneyland. A larger Disney family apartment was later built above New Orleans Square. 15. The apartment above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., includes a dressing area, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a shower. The couches fold out to make additional beds. 16. On opening day, Disneyland contained 800 mostly nonindigenous species of plants from as far away as Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan. 17. More than 12,000 orange trees were removed from the 160-acre plot that became Disneyland. Some of the discarded trees were replanted upside down along the banks of the Jungle Cruise to look like mangrove roots. 18. The route of the Jungle Cruise was laid out with a Jeep outfitted to simulate the length and width of a riverboat. 19. The Mark Twain stern-wheeler, built at a cost of $150,000, was constructed in pieces and assembled at Disneyland. The upper deck was fabricated in Burbank, and the hull was built at a San Pedro shipyard, trucked overnight to the park and lifted by crane into the Rivers of America. 20. Fantasyland's carousel operated at Toronto's Sunnyside Park for decades before being moved to Disneyland in advance of the park's opening. The original carousel featured a menagerie of animals but now has only horses. Additional horses were acquired from other amusement parks. 21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million. 48. In summer 1970, somebody circulated gag fliers proposing a yippie invasion of Disneyland on Aug. 6. On the appointed day, dozens of yippies, or perhaps generic hippies, gathered on Tom Sawyer Island and raised a Viet Cong flag. Management took the rare step of closing the park five hours early, prompting a bold headline (with photos) on the next day's front page of The Times: \"Yippies' Outburst Shuts Disneyland.\" 49. When the park opened, it had both pay and free toilets. Soon after, all bathrooms became free. 50. Walt Disney and author Ray Bradbury were friends. One day at lunch, Bradbury offered to help rebuild Tomorrowland. Disney is said to have replied: \"Ray, it's no use … you're a genius and I'm a genius … after two weeks we'd kill each other!\" Later, Bradbury called it \"the nicest turndown I've ever had.\" 51. By the time It's a Small World opened at Disneyland in 1966, it had already been seen by more than 10 million visitors during its two years at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. 52. Walt Disney had a lot of input into Pirates of the Caribbean, but he died in December 1966, about four months before the ride opened. 53. In 1971, stage psychic the Amazing Criswell predicted that by 1999, Disneyland would be covered by a plastic bubble, its weather controlled by a switch. 54. Though Walt Disney sported a mustache for most of his adult life, Disneyland banned facial hair on its workers from 1957 until 2000, when restrictions were eased. 55. If Disneyland's original $1 adult admission fee had increased in lockstep with the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, today it would be $8.87. Instead, it's $99. (But in the old days, you had to buy ride tickets separately. Now they're included.) 56. In September 1959, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a historic visit to Los Angeles and asked to see Disneyland. His minders first said yes, and then no, after Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker said he couldn't guarantee Khrushchev's safety. \"Why not?\" Khrushchev protested at a public luncheon. \"What is it? Do you have rocket-launching pads there? ... Is there an epidemic of cholera there? … Have gangsters taken hold of the place?\" 57. In Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the Toad Hall library includes these titles: \"For Whom the Toads Croak\" and \"A Tadpole Grows in Brooklyn.\" 58. When it opened in June 1959, Disneyland's monorail was the first daily operating monorail in the Western Hemisphere. 59. Sleeping Beauty Castle is 77 feet tall. Neuschwanstein, the 19th century Bavarian castle that's widely credited as its inspiration, is 213 feet high. (Neuschwanstein, about 80 miles southwest of Munich, Germany, gets 1.4 million visitors yearly.) 60. For height reasons, there's a good chance Mickey Mouse and many other costumed characters are played by female cast members. Male cast members portray the taller characters such as Goofy and Sheriff Woody. Princess characters have strict height requirements: They must be 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall.

    "DiffbotBody": "Would you run from a dinosaur in these shoes? From dinosaur theme parks to the red carpets of Cannes, everyone seems to be talking about high-heeled shoes. Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: First, stand barefoot and then rise onto your toes repeatedly. Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Southwest Airlines' controversial CEO Gary Kelly appears to have opened a huge hornets' nest in the wake of news about a tentative agreement on a new contract with more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants who work at the low-fare behemoth. With Southwest's largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, Chicago also is the domicile for the largest number of Southwest flight attendants, more than 1,800 altogether, according to a spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents Southwest flight attendants. Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Another flight attendant with more than a decade of work at Southwest offered a similar sentiment in an email: \"The (Local 556) union does appear to be too cozy with management.\" Though so-called \"educators\" have been used by Local 556 in the past to help members sort through and understand details of proposed contracts, some flight attendants questioned that procedure this time around, suggesting it could be another means of influencing— or pressuring — union members to vote in favor of a new contract. Noted one Southwest flight attendant: \"Our union handpicked 100 people to fly into Dallas for 'tentative agreement' training with our union dollars for two days so they could 'educate' the rest of us on the tentative agreement.\" Some flight attendants also wondered why Southwest management was suddenly able to come to tentative terms with flight attendants, while other major unions, including those representing pilots, ramp agents and mechanics, have been unable to get even a tentative deal. Ramp agents, in particular, have been in talks for some four years. Flight attendant contract negotiations had been ongoing for two years. The rank and file members of Local 556 will be able to get their first look at the full contract starting tomorrow. Then they will have 16 days to obtain the proposed contract, read it, digest it and then vote — a shorter time frame than the 30-day window for previous contracts, according to some flight attendants who wonder why this is all suddenly so rushed. A Local 556 spokesman said the contract would be ratified if a majority of those who actually vote cast a vote in favor of ratification. As for the vocal backlash among some rank and file union members to news of the tentative contract, a Local 556 spokesman noted: \"We are a large group and not everyone is going to see things the same way.\" By the end of July, however, it should be clear whether enough flight attendants see the proposed contract the same way Southwest Airlines management and Local 556's executive board apparently do.",

Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Want Chicago Travel news in your inbox?

The Straw at Miracle Mile Deli When it comes to New York-style deli fare in the middle of the dessert, Miracle Mile Deli is about as good as you can do. For generations, this has been a family-run operation serving brisket of beef, corned beef, and matzoh ball soup. This year, the restaurant moved to a new freestanding location on 16th Street — and it serves beer and wine. It's truly a new age for this Valley landmark restaurant. You will experience a food coma if you eat this sandwich, so consider yourself warned. Which isn't to say you should let the prospect of sleeping away the afternoon deter you from ordering the Straw. This sandwich is piled high with pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut, not a particularly original combination, but satisfying nonetheless. You'll get your choice of breads, and the best option is to get your sandwich served on a hearty onion roll that will actually soak up all the juices from the meat and kraut. For a side, you'll get a kosher dill pickle, of course, and you'll have a choice to stick with the customary offering (French fries) or upgrade to something else.

But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "DiffbotBody": "STAMFORD — By all accounts, the Ridgefield 12-year old Little League team sports one of the most dangerous lineups in the District 1 tournament, needing no help to succeed, but when given a few extra outs to play with they make the opposition pay. Ridgefield twice struck out with two outs in the second inning, but both batters reached base on wild pitches, extending the inning and allowing the bats to get going. And they got going in a big way, busting out for nine runs in the second inning on the way to an 11-6 victory over Weston in the District 1 Little League double-elimination tournament at Springdale Little League Field in Stamford Friday evening. With the win, Ridgefield moves on in the winner’s bracket while Weston falls into the loser’s bracket where it will next play an elimination game Saturday against Wilton. Ridgefield coach Jeff Lacoille said the extra few chances in the second inning were a blessing to his team. “That was huge and we had a nice breakout inning,” Lacoille said. “I kind of made some mistakes out there early and they picked me up.” That breakout inning featured home runs by Johnny Briody and Jake Bongo with eight of the nine Ridgefield batters scoring in the inning and Bongo coming around twice in the frame. For Ridgefield, Bongo scored twice and had 2 RBI; Briody had 2 RBI and a double to go with his home run; Alex Hanna was 2 for 4 with two runs and a RBI and Luke Barrientos drove in two runs on the evening. Weston coach Seve Esposito said at this stage in the tournament it is tough to win when making mistakes. “We can’t do that,” Esposito said. “We are like a dark horse in this tournament because we have never gotten this far but we have done that by making no mistakes. When you start giving up 3, 4, 5 outs an inning that’s how it happens.” For Weston, Myles Lehrman was 4 for 4 with two doubles and two runs scored; Evan Levine had a home run, double and 5 RBI and Alex Olsen hit a home run and scored three runs as Weston chipped away at the lead but could not whittle it down. Weston led 2-0 in the second with Levine plating two runs with a double. Weston added a run in the fourth on Olsen’s home run and three more in the sixth on Levine’s blast. Ridgefield tacked on two more runs in the fifth, padding the lead with runs driven in by Jack Gonzalez and Diego Pepe.

And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",
    "LabBody": "Martin O'Malley wants the U.S. to accept as many as 13 times the number of Syrian refugees it currently plans to take in. The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

For the latest news and views on gas, coal, electricity and more, check out On the Grid today. 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Saturday, July 11, 2015, 12:01 a.m. WASHINGTON — Parents may hesitate to hand teens the keys to the family car, but Congress is proposing to allow drivers as young as 18 to get behind the wheel of big rigs on the nation's interstates. Federal regulations require drivers be at least 21 before they can drive commercial trucks across state lines, but a bill introduced this week by Republican senators would allow contiguous states that join together in “compacts” to drop the age threshold to 18 for interstate trips. There is no limit on the number of states that could join the compacts. After four years, the Transportation secretary is supposed to report to Congress on whether teens have “an equivalent level of safety” in comparison with older truckers. In 2013, all drivers ages 18-20 had a fatal crash involvement rate, per 100,000 licensed drivers, that was 66 percent higher than drivers who were age 21 years or older, according to the Transportation Department's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, although the total number of crash deaths among teens has been declining since 2002. The change was sought by the trucking industry to help address a shortage of truck drivers. The American Trucking Association estimates that the current shortage of drivers is roughly 35,000 to 40,000, but because of retirements and individuals leaving the industry, trucking companies will need to recruit nearly 100,000 new drivers a year over the next decade to keep pace with the country's freight needs. But Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said allowing teens to drive trucks weighing as much as 80,000 pounds and to work as many as 82 hours a week, as is permitted in the truck industry, is a “catastrophe waiting to happen.” “The combination of inexperience, high-risk driving and large trucks can cause unbelievable devastation,” she said. Dave Osiecki, chief of advocacy for trucking associations, said states already allow teens to drive commercial trucks unlimited miles within their borders. For example, it makes no sense to allow a teen truck driver to drive hundreds of miles from one end to the other of a state like Virginia, but prohibit the same driver from crossing the Potomac River into Washington, he said. “We absolutely support” lowering the age limit, he said. “It would be good for our industry, it would be good for commerce, it would be good for the economy.” Legislation to allow states to lower the age for a commercial, interstate license to 18 was first introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and was incorporated into a larger transportation bill introduced this week by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Fischer. The bill would restrict teen truckers from hauling hazardous materials or operating “special configurations,” which are generally defined as oversized or overweight loads. States and the U.S. Department of Transportation would also be allowed to impose other restrictions if they wish. States wouldn't be obligated to join the compacts, but Gillan said she expects state officials would be under pressure from the trucking industry to do so. To obtain an interstate commercial driver's license, drivers must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test administered by a state motor vehicles department. But there is no requirement that drivers first receive on the road training or attend a training school, Gillan said. Labor unions have said the driver shortage could be eliminated by raising truckers' wages and improving working conditions. A decade ago the Bush administration looked at lowering the commercial truck driving age to 18, but ultimately decided against doing that because the public comments the government received were overwhelmingly against the idea.

    "DiffbotBody": "Uber and Lyft have taken to prices slashes in Manhattan as they continue to fight. The battleground of the ride-hailing war has now moved from San Francisco to Manhattan. On Friday, bitter rivals Uber and Lyft, both of which offer on-demand rides with the tap of a mobile app, announced price slashes to their carpooling services in Manhattan. So, if you’re looking for a ride and don’t want to grab a taxi, here are your options: UberPool: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan, as long as it starts and ends south of 96th Street, and it will cost $10 at most (or less if the distance doesn’t reach $10 per Uber’s fare math), and regardless of whether you get matched to carpool with another rider. Uber says this is for a limited time, so keep an eye out for announcements in case it changes. Lyft Line: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan as long as it starts and ends south of 97th Street (note the extra block), and it will cost only $5 even if you’re not matched with another carpooler. The catch is that this only works for one rider. If you are with a friend, you will be charged $1 dollar for both of you to get into the car. Gett: This Israeli car service contender has been quieter than Uber and Lyft, but it’s been offering $10 rides anywhere in Manhattan south of 110th Street since last September. Oh, and you don’t have to carpool and you get to ride in a fancy black car. Uber and Lyft have been running this playbook in San Francisco for several months now, and prices have fluctuated. Manhattanites should expect these deals to be temporary. New York’s city council is also expected to consider a proposal that would halt these services’ expansion by capping the number of cars they can add every year, so any of the above could be affected. Lyft recently agreed to pay $300,000 to settle a city complaint. At least New York still has a pretty good subway system…",

    "DiffbotBody": "What do Greece, Ireland and the U.S. have in common? Each experienced what was termed at the time a “new financial era” that produced an enormous expansion of its finance sector. This led to an intoxicating combination of aggressive lending, leverage and recklessness. In each case, the era ended in a financial crisis; perhaps most important, each crisis ended with a bailout of lenders, bondholders and bankers. This hat trick of bank bailouts hasn’t gone unnoticed in Greece. Yanis Varoufakis, who just resigned as finance minister of Greece, might be a provocateur, but he is apparently no fool. Monday in a blog post he said, “The Greek ‘bailouts’ were exercises whose purpose was intentionally to transfer private losses onto the shoulders of the weakest Greeks, before being transferred to other European taxpayers.” This astute (albeit little known) insight has been echoed by a small number of insightful analysts. My favorite of these is Steve Randy Waldman. His take on the Greek bailouts includes an in-depth discussion of the 2010 assistance program as “largely a bailout of European banks, initiated to prevent a wider banking crisis.” Alas, bailing out banks as a way to fix a financial crisis is standard operating procedure. What was called the “Mexican bailout of 1982” was, in fact, a bailout of the U.S. banks that made improvident loans to Mexico (as well as to Brazil and Argentina) that had gone bad. As if to prove all parties were unwilling to learn from their experiences, a repeat of almost the exact same errors with the same players — bankers, Latin American borrowers and the U.S. — unfolded in 1994. The emerging market crises in 1997 weren’t identical, but displayed similar themes of leverage, recklessness and loans gone bad. What the EU has foisted upon Greece appears to be a thinly disguised rescue for private sector (primarily German) lenders, not a plan for the future of Greece. Which brings us to Greece. The latest restructuring attempt has been emphatically rejected by the Greek people as little more than a bailout for European creditors. Although more pain awaits the Greeks (as well as those who made related macro bets), we are on the road to socializing the losses of German banks. Consider the previous bailouts and restructurings: The austerity imposed on the Greeks made their economy significantly worse. The financial crisis might have been bad, but the bailouts made it a debacle, transforming a fragile post-credit crisis weakness into a full depression. According to Eurostat, Greece’s gross domestic product fell 26%, to 179 billion euros ($198 billion) last year, from 242 billion euros in 2008. Per capita income fell 24%, as the unemployment rate rose to more than 27%, from less than 10% in 2005. What the EU has foisted upon Greece appears to be a thinly disguised rescue for private sector (primarily German) lenders, not a plan for the future of Greece. You may not be familiar with the phrase “lemon socialism,” but that is precisely what this is: private profits and socialized losses. Understandably, it is difficult for the public to accept the asymmetry of this situation, which explains why people respond by protesting (Ireland), voting down austerity (Greece) or forming new political movements (U.S.’s tea party). With Varoufakis gone, the Europeans are rid of an adversary who made negotiations difficult. But the events he helped set in motion are far more significant than his negotiating style. The Europeans have to accept that Greeks are no longer willing to accept Austrian-style austerity as a pre-condition for a rescue plan. They are slowly figuring out that they would do better on their own than to suffer at the hands of European technocrats. There’s still time for a full debt restructuring for the benefit of the Greek people, not the German banks. Germany’s rigid stance is somewhat ironic, given the generous debt forgiveness it received after World War II. So far, the Greek people haven’t been treated with similar generosity. It’s no surprise they have rejected the failing prescription of more austerity. Barry Ritholtz, a Bloomberg View columnist, is the founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management.

    "DiffbotBody": "STAMFORD — By all accounts, the Ridgefield 12-year old Little League team sports one of the most dangerous lineups in the District 1 tournament, needing no help to succeed, but when given a few extra outs to play with they make the opposition pay. Ridgefield twice struck out with two outs in the second inning, but both batters reached base on wild pitches, extending the inning and allowing the bats to get going. And they got going in a big way, busting out for nine runs in the second inning on the way to an 11-6 victory over Weston in the District 1 Little League double-elimination tournament at Springdale Little League Field in Stamford Friday evening. With the win, Ridgefield moves on in the winner’s bracket while Weston falls into the loser’s bracket where it will next play an elimination game Saturday against Wilton. Ridgefield coach Jeff Lacoille said the extra few chances in the second inning were a blessing to his team. “That was huge and we had a nice breakout inning,” Lacoille said. “I kind of made some mistakes out there early and they picked me up.” That breakout inning featured home runs by Johnny Briody and Jake Bongo with eight of the nine Ridgefield batters scoring in the inning and Bongo coming around twice in the frame. For Ridgefield, Bongo scored twice and had 2 RBI; Briody had 2 RBI and a double to go with his home run; Alex Hanna was 2 for 4 with two runs and a RBI and Luke Barrientos drove in two runs on the evening. Weston coach Seve Esposito said at this stage in the tournament it is tough to win when making mistakes. “We can’t do that,” Esposito said. “We are like a dark horse in this tournament because we have never gotten this far but we have done that by making no mistakes. When you start giving up 3, 4, 5 outs an inning that’s how it happens.” For Weston, Myles Lehrman was 4 for 4 with two doubles and two runs scored; Evan Levine had a home run, double and 5 RBI and Alex Olsen hit a home run and scored three runs as Weston chipped away at the lead but could not whittle it down. Weston led 2-0 in the second with Levine plating two runs with a double. Weston added a run in the fourth on Olsen’s home run and three more in the sixth on Levine’s blast. Ridgefield tacked on two more runs in the fifth, padding the lead with runs driven in by Jack Gonzalez and Diego Pepe. Ridgefield 11, Weston 6 Batteries: R - Jack Bohrer, Andrew Forsyth (2, W), Johnny Briody (4), Luke Barrientos (6) and Jason Hartnett.

    "DiffbotBody": "The rumored “Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo” smartphone is back in the news after a small hiatus. According to reports, a brand-new device was spotted in the Wi-Fi interoperability certification site, and it's believed to be the S5 Neo. The smartphone entry tied to model number SM-G903F has apparently received Wi-Fi certification. When a device gets a Wi-Fi certification, the site gives away key specifications and features. Sam Mobile says the model number matches the device the site discovered earlier, so Samsung could finally be launching the Galaxy S5 Neo. As far as the key Galaxy S5 Neo specifications go, the handset will reportedly be identical to the 2014 flagship Galaxy S5 in many ways. The device will come with a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, aided by a full HD screen resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Under the hood, the Galaxy S5 Neo will reportedly be powered by a 64-bit octa-core (Samsung Exynos 7580) processor, running at 1.6 GHz. In comparison, the flagship Galaxy S5 comes powered by a Snapdragon 801 processor. Plus, the Neo will be backed by a modest 2 GB of RAM unit and the graphics side will be taken care by a Mali-T720 GPU, notes GSM Arena. On the software front, as expected, the handset will run on Android 5.1 Lollipop OS, straight out of the box. And the device will come equipped with 16 GB of in-built storage capacity. The Neo will reportedly sport a 16 MP rear-facing camera unit. In addition, it will flaunt a generous 5 MP front-facing snapper unit for selfies and video chats. Furthermore, the entire configurations will be held together and powered by a good 2,800 mAh battery unit. In addition to the standard connectivity options, the Galaxy S5 Neo will support LTE Advanced or LTE-A. Notably, the Galaxy S5 comes with only the standard LTE support. To top it all off, this Neo device will be released in single-SIM and dual-SIM models. In the meantime, an earlier rumor out of the Czech Republic stated the price of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo will be $490 equivalent. Even though this device cannot be compared to the South Korean tech giant’s Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, for a mid- to high-end handset, the specifications sounds like a good deal. Samsung has not confirmed the Galaxy S5 Neo specifications or price thus far.",

Every year around June or July, the residents of Laos and Thailand celebrate a rocket festival called Prapheni Bun Bang Fai. The festival is now a Buddhist celebration but has its roots all the way back to pre-Buddhist fertility rites. The Bang Fai rockets are charged with 120 kilograms of black powder and are scored by judges for beauty, heights and distance reached.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Why is it that some people achieve so much more than others? Are they blessed with \"golden child\" genes or is it something more common than that? Everyone wants to know the secret to success. Hundreds of authors have written books on their idea of what the secret is, and millions have purchased those books looking for the answer. However, many people look at the big successes of people but don't really delve into the little successes and actions that got them there. Benjamin Franklin wrote out and planned every hour of his day from waking up and bathing to \"putting things in order.\" It is the daily actions of successful people, the little things that most people overlook, that get them to the top. The good news is that these habits can be encouraged at an early age. Many successful people are creatures of habit when it comes to how they plan their day, and the choices they make with their time makes all the difference in the level of success they achieve. If you aspire for a more productive day and desire a higher level of opportunties for your children in their lives, here are five habits many successful people do on a daily basis. 1. Have a morning routine This seems like a tedious and minuscule aspect of someone's day, but the truth is, a morning routine has a positive effect on your day. That feeling encourages you to cross something off your list and leaves you feeling accomplished. The purpose of your routine should be to prepare for the day as well as to get started on accomplishing tasks. Not everything you do will be something you enjoy, but you can mix it up with things that get the dopamine flowing, like having your favorite muffin for breakfast. By adapting a morning routine for your children, they have an opportunity to mentally prepare for the demands of the day. An organized morning eliminates misplaced homework, wasted time chasing down a lost shoe, and allows your child time to concentrate on the demands of the day. 2. Have a to-do list Many people overlook the value of having a to-do list. Yet, it provides a localized place where everything you need to do is written down. One of the simple pleasures of the day is being able to cross off a task when completed. By keeping up with your list, you tend to automatically fall into a mode of productivity, which keeps running throughout the day. Put the things you absolutely need to accomplish at the top, followed by the things you need to complete soon, ending with the things that do not have a close deadline. But start the list with something easy to complete, giving yourself a little dose of accomplishment that gets you a head start on your list. Many schools now encourage the use of a daily planner for their students to keep track of upcoming assignments and test schedules. By utilizing a to-do list, and reviewing it regularly, your child won't be caught unprepared for an upcoming midterm or research paper. 3. Do the things you hate first \"Do your chores, then you can play with your friends.\" This childhood motto still holds true for adults. Try getting the tedious and most disliked tasks out of the way. You'll feel the weight come off your shoulders, and you will be able to enjoy the tasks you like even more when you know you don't have the unpleasant ones hanging over your head. On top of that, the day will seem to go by much faster after you've eliminated the not-so-fun tasks. 4. Focus on the positives So often in life we are prepared to perform our best, yet things don't go our way. Despite our efforts, we still took second in debate, we didn't make the basketball team, we didn't get accepted to the school of our choice. Life is filled with disappointments and setbacks. If you focus on the things you are good at and the positive aspects of the day it will alter your mood to reflect your positive thinking, and things will begin to change. An important lesson for your children is to realize that life will require a need to adapt. Yet, you can continue forward by focusing on the successes you have had. Don't let negativity consume your thinking. Remember, a ship (you) can be sunk by a single puncture if it continues to let in more water (negativity). 5. Visualize Jack Nicklaus is often referred to as the greatest golfer of all time. Throughout a 25-year professional career that included winning 18 major golf championships, Nicklaus practiced visualization with every shot. He mentally played the hole before he ever picked up his club to swing. \"Sometimes the biggest problem is in your head. You've got to believe you can play a shot instead of wondering where your next bad shot is coming from,\" he said. Envisioning your success is vital. It enables you to focus on your goals and get your mind thinking positively. \"The man who thinks he can, and the man who thinks he can't, are both usually right.\" Athletes in all sports are instructed to visualize their next at-bat or their next goal because it truly does have a significant effect on the outcome. For many of us, the pathway to success may seem out of reach or reserved for those of extraordinary talent. But history is filled with extraordinary leaders whose beginnings were less than ideal. By incorporating a morning routine, organizing tasks, focusing on our abilities and keeping a clear vision in mind of what we hope to accomplish, we can enjoy a life filled with productivity, achievement and success.

    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "The superintendent got a vote of confidence. He deserves the Medal of Honor IN A VOTE of confidence, the School Reform Commission last week said it owed Superintendent William Hite what it called a \"performance bonus.\" It should have been called combat pay. That's the extra pay given to members of the U.S. military who serve in \"designated combat zones or hazardous duty areas.\" That pretty much describes the Philadelphia School District, certainly in 2012 when Hite took over after the SRC fired Superintendent Arlene Ackerman. They were perilous times, certainly for the students in the District. The state has slashed about $500 million in aid, creating a huge hole in the district's budget. A round of layoffs - that would continue for several years - was just beginning. Ackerman, whose imperious style earned her the nickname \"Queen Arlene,\" had a knack for making enemies, so the District had few friends in the outside world, especially among the politicians who controlled the purse strings. Hite was the calm after the Ackerman storm. A Virginian with a courtly manner, Hite began his career as a classroom teacher, rising through the ranks to become superintendent of public schools in Prince George's County, in Maryland. It was a large district, though nothing could fully prepare him for the challenge of running an urban school district in the battlefield called Philadelphia. What he was able to draw upon are character traits that make him a good leader. He has offered a consistency of vision, a pro-child and pro-parent agenda, a genuine belief that every child can learn and a determination about making real change in how schools operate in this city. What Hite also brought to the table was a personality that won over critics. He never raises his voice. He never points his finger to blame. He exhibits patience and forbearance - even in the face of screaming protesters or angry lawmakers. Instead, he has countered with a call for \"shared sacrifices\" by all parties involved in education in the city to pull the District out of the hole it fell into before he arrived. We can't say he has succeeded, but that failure is due to forces outside of his control. With the notable exception of Mayor Nutter, he has not gotten much from the political class. He's still at loggerheads with the teachers union over concessions he's sought. Financially, the district is no longer under siege but it's still a combat zone. Services are at a minimal level. Resources are scant. This week, Hite moved ahead with changes he had been planning centered on decentralizing power in the district, reasoning that if he waited for needed money to arrive he could be waiting forever. That is called optimism. He has restored the reputation to a system that was so lacking when he arrived. That is called credibility. He has consistently shown grace under pressure, which is one definition of courage. Hite makes a good salary. But, it's no surprise, given his performance, that the SRC wanted to give him a $60,000 bonus. And it's no surprise that Hite turned it down, saying it would be unfair given the district's finances. We call that leadership.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Sacramento, it’s time to let your soul glow. The setting will be Saturday at Southside Park, where on a stage that’s decorated with a mural by the Royal Chicano Air Force art collective, a variety of bands will play their classic R\u0026B tunes. Food trucks and other vendors meanwhile will serve a melting pot of offerings, including Jamaican cuisine, Italian ices and classic tacos. Such is the vision that organizers have for the Soul of Sacramento Music \u0026 Food Festival. This debut event features an appearance by Club Nouveau, which rose out of Sacramento in the 1980s with the hits “Lean on Me” and “Why You Treat Me So Bad.” Also appearing are staples of any proper old-school R\u0026B dance party: Dazz Band (“Let it Whip”), Lakeside (“Fantastic Voyage”) and Vallejo’s Con Funk Shun (“Ffun”). The music will kick off with a set from Faze-O, known for its much-sampled 1977 song “Riding High.” Jay King, the leader of Club Nouveau and festival organizer, thinks this mix of music and down-home foods provides the perfect Sacramento vibe. “It’s not just an urban event,” said King. “We want all of Sacramento to come out. We picked these groups because we wanted a fun, party-type atmosphere. Sacramento is growing with the new arena and a lot of development, and we believe the city can handle this kind of event.” King says that Soul of Sacramento is a response to a similar event held in September 2014. The first “Soul Food Festival” was similarly held in Southside Park and also included Lakeside as a featured musical act, but suffered from food shortages, long delays between acts and other organizational issues. King believed that a similar kind of soulful festival was right for Sacramento and teamed with local promoters Henry “Bumpy” Gonzales and Joseph Yusef White to produce Saturday’s event. They wanted to expand the range of foods to include dishes from a variety of cultures, such as teriyaki, Southern vittles and burritos. The festival will feature eight food trucks, including Flavor Face and North Border Taco, along with additional food vendors. “Instead of just soul foods, we wanted to make it all foods,” said King. “And it’s affordable. Nothing is over $10 to $12 for a plate.” But music will serve as the festival’s main entree. King expects upward of 3,500 attendees at the event, who will move and groove to a summer evening with classic R\u0026B tracks. King himself ranks as one of Sacramento’s most significant success stories, hitting the top of Billboard’s R\u0026B charts in 1986 with Timex Social Club’s “Rumors” and No. 1 on Billboard’s singles charts with “Lean on Me” in 1987. King, who now lives in Southern California, is working on a solo album and the follow-up to Club Nouveau’s “Consciousness,” which was released in 2014. He will perform double duty Saturday, as both a performing artist and organizer making sure that everything’s running smoothly. If all goes to plan, he hopes that Soul of Sacramento won’t be a one-hit wonder. “Sacramento is a great music town,” said King. “Our hope is that we can expand to a whole weekend where we do everything – jazz, rock, reggae, gospel, a whole smorgasbord if you will. We want to be back next year, and every year after that.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project. At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited.

    "DiffbotBody": "A different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. How exactly does one follow up , the surprise-hit, male-stripper melodrama that catered to a heated audience (mainly female, slightly male) but served them a cinematic buffet concocted by skilled storyteller Steven Soderbergh? Easy. You take the show on the road. To that extent, Magic Mike XXL is the most accurate depiction of male entertainers road-tripping from Tampa to Myrtle Beach for an annual convention that Hollywood has ever produced. If you only see one movie this summer about male strippers bonding over unfulfilled dreams while they titillate female clientele, make sure it’s this one. Why? Because it’s great. Magic Mike XXL often operates as the movie Entourage desperately wanted to be – or worse, actually thinks that it is. It’s 100% bro-powered, telling the low-stakes story of impossibly handsome dudes living their irregular lives, and inviting us along for the intimate ride. But the camaraderie and mutual respect – the Zen-like “chi” that’s preached and practiced by the men of Mike -- is as organic as unforced as Entourage was artificial. As a result, Magic Mike is believable, embraceable, and worthy of celebration. Where Richard Donner’s Superman once inspired us to believe that a man can fly, Magic Mike XXL convinces us beyond a shadow of a doubt that a dancer can leave the stage behind and open an ice cream truck that has a DJ booth attached -- entertaining the masses and satisfying their sweet tooth at the same time. Picking up shortly after Magic Mike concluded, the sequel finds Mike (Channing Tatum) struggling to get his carpentry business off the ground when a phone call summons him back to Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), the freewheeling choreographer and club owner, has jumped ship, leaving beautiful but dense dancers “Big Dick” Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan, (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tito (Adam Rodriguez) rudderless. Sensing that their stripper endeavors are drawing to a close, the guys agree to venture to South Carolina for one last blowout bash at an annual dancers’ convention. Along the way, Mike convinces them to ditch the routines that Dallas burned into their individual memories (“You are not a fireman, Richie”) and embrace new routines that come from the heart. And the crotch. But mainly from the heart. Magic Mike XXL pulls off a legitimate magic trick, recognizing the expectations of its suddenly sizable fanbase and somehow exceeding them. Magic Mike XXL isn’t surprising anyone this time out. The original film cost roughly $7 million, but went on to gross a massive $167 million, fuelled by female curiosity, the magnetism of Tatum (and his co-stars), and legitimately positive word of mouth that proclaimed Soderbergh crafted a moving soap-opera in a seedy, sweat-soaked Tampa strip club – the unlikeliest of cinematic communities. Audiences came to the theater with crumpled up singles, but left Magic Mike with soggy tissues, emotionally buying in to the ongoing struggles of these three-dimensional dancers. A sequel was inevitable, and with it comes change. Soderbergh opted to stay in his self-imposed “retirement,” handing the directing duties over to longtime collaborator Gregory Jacobs (though Soderbergh did contribute to XXL as a cinematographer and editor, explaining why this follow-up has the same sweaty, late-night shimmer of the first film). And now that he has an Oscar on his shelf, McConaughey chose to hang up Dallas’ leather chaps and opt out of the fun. No bother. His mystical aura is usurped by a larger-than-life Jada Pinkett Smith, who slinks across the screen and deliberately swipes every scene as Rome, an uber-confident and confidence-boosting Savannah strip club owner who welcomes Mike back into her world of empowerment. Like Dallas, Rome resembles a character we only think exists on screen in stories like Mike XXL, and I wondered numerous times during her unique scenes if this person, and her establishment, actually exist. Moving forward, however, I don’t need more Rome. Quite the contrary. I’d be thrilled if each Magic Mike sequel found a new character actor willing to fill the “role” of outsized Mike mentor, the way McConaughey and Pinkett Smith already have. Wait, subsequent Magic Mike movies? You better believe it. Magic Mike XXL is a different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining… by design. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and surprisingly unpredictable. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. XXL sheds the heaviest baggage of Soderbergh’s initial foray, keeping just enough drama to ensure tension, then filling in the gaps with unfiltered bro-heavy chemistry. It’s a winning formula, and one that proves that Mike’s world is one worth revisiting, just to spend time with these friends. We spend a lot of time talking about developing Cinematic Universes for characters who don tights and capes. What about the guys who slip out of their super suits to entertain? Don’t they deserve their own multi-film series? If and when Magic Mike XXL matches the box-office bar set by the original, it’s time we start having that conversation.",

Next, depart for Rabat, Morocco’s capital city and the current residence of its monarch. Although this city has established itself as a commercial hub, tourism is still in its infancy, allowing those who do venture here to enjoy unspoiled views of palm-lined boulevards, colonial architecture and tranquil streets. You will visit the Royal Palace, the Hassan Tower and other major sites of Rabat. Following lunch in the capital city, drive north into the Rif mountain region to one of Morocco’s prettiest towns: Chefchaouen, often called Chaouen by Moroccans. The town, located in the shadows of the rugged peaks of the Rifs, was founded in 1492 by Moorish exiles, and today the ancient Arab-Andalusian arts and traditions can still be seen. Known as “the Blue City” because of its blue-washed houses, the colorful doorways and cobblestone streets of Chefchaouen make it a photographer’s paradise. Check into the hotel before a late-afternoon photo session. After dinner, you will return to the narrow streets for more photography at dusk.",

    "DiffbotBody": "LAS VEGAS If anything, Willie Cauley-Stein is honest when assessing his play. Following the rookie center’s summer league debut, Cauley-Stein didn’t seem to remember the highlight-type blocked shots. “Not good, not bad, just kind of decent,” is how Cauley-Stein summed up his game. “I had some good plays, but I had some plays where I’d tip a ball I could get but they’d get and they’d score. That type of stuff.” The Kings lost to the Toronto Raptors 90-68 at the Thomas \u0026 Mack Center. Cauley-Stein had 11 points, five rebounds and two blocks. He made 4 of 9 shots but also blew chances to make shots at the rim. By his count, Cauley-Stein should have had “two or three” dunks. “I thought I had a good pace, but just finishing, that’s my big emphasis,” Cauley-Stein said. “Finishing around the rim, and I thought we gave up a lot of layups.” Cauley-Stein did show the kind of hustle defensively the Kings want to see, even if the rookie sees a lot more he can do. “I think Willie’s first strength is going to be his pick-and-roll defense,” said Kings assistant coach Chad Iske. “His feet are so quick, and that’s going to be a big asset. Second will be his ability to protect the rim and get back on defense.” Cauley-Stein lamented the Raptors’ layups, saying it’s up to the big men, including himself, to do a better job of keeping scorers away from the basket. “He has to be a rim protector for us,” Iske said. “That’s why we drafted him.” Iske thought Cauley-Stein had good scoring chances at the rim when the Kings played with proper spacing. Cauley-Stein can credit his college experience for making his adjustments on where to be on offense easier. “(Playing with spacing is) not bad,” Cauley-Stein said. “At Kentucky, we play that far anyways. We played with the NBA three for spacing, so it’s not as challenging as it might be for other guys.” Away from the court, the Kings continued to add experience to the roster. The team reached an agreement with free-agent forward Caron Butler on a two-year contract. Butler averaged 5.9 points in 78 games with Detroit last season. Butler, 35, is the third veteran the Kings will add who has won an NBA championship. Butler was a part of the Dallas team that won the title in 2011. The Kings wanted to add another small forward with Rudy Gay expected to play much more at power forward this season. Sacramento also announced the trade to send Nik Stauskas, Carl Landry and Jason Thompson to Philadelphia is official. The deal frees up about $16 million under the salary cap for the Kings, who now can sign their free agents. Deals with Rajon Rondo, Marco Belinelli, Kostas Koufos and Omri Casspi should be signed this weekend. Sacramento received the draft rights to center Arturas Gudaitis and forward Luka Mitrovic from the 76ers in the deal. Neither is expected to join the Kings in the immediate future. Philadelphia also has the right to swap first-round picks in 2016 and 2017 with Sacramento and gets a top-10 protected first-round pick from the Kings in 2018. Gudaitis (6-10, 254) was the 47th overall pick in last month’s draft. He plays for BC Lietuvos Rytas of the Lithuanian Basketball League. Mitrovic (6-9, 225) was the 60th pick in the draft last month. He plays for Crvena Zvezda Belgrade of the Basketball League of Serbia. He averaged 8.6 points and 5.2 rebounds in 24.7 minutes in 24 games with 20 starts. Crvena Zvezda won the Adriatic League championship, the Serbian League championship and the Radivoj Korać Cup.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Hype can be a dangerous thing in fantasy football. Sure, it's great to know who this year's rising stars and hot sleepers are. The problem begins when everyone starts reading the same reports. Writing their own takes based on those reports. Targeting the same players based on what they've read and/or written. That, in turn, drives up the asking price of those sleepers and value plays. A running back who was being drafted close to his fantasy floor rises nearer to his ceiling. That late-round lottery ticket wideout goes from $1 scratcher to one of those big, shiny ones that cost 20 bucks. In 2014, everyone and their mother (hi Mom!) were convinced that San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green was going to take the reins from Antonio Gates. Green's Average Draft Position rose steadily throughout the summer, to the point he was drafted ahead of the future Hall of Famer. Well, Gates caught 12 touchdowns and finished as a top-five tight end in most scoring systems. Green caught 19 passes all season long. With that cautionary tale in mind, here are a handful of players for whom hype levels are redlining in 2015. Begin Slideshow » Average Draft Position: QB4 (37th overall) I will be the first person to admit that I'm an unabashed fan of Seattle Seahawks quarterback . My admiration for him as a player borders on man-crush levels. And Wilson is coming off a phenomenal season, both from an NFL and fantasy football perspective. Wilson set career highs in passing yards (3,475), rushing yards (849) and rushing touchdowns (six) en route to leading the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Wilson also posted the best fantasy finish of his three-year career, finishing fifth at his position in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. With Wilson headed into the final year of his rookie deal, there has been speculation that Wilson could be set to become the highest-paid player in NFL history. Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated might not be willing to go quite that far, but you'll get no argument from him that Wilson's worth a whole lotta money: Is Russell Wilson a franchise quarterback? I would posit that the answer lies somewhere between “Yes” and “Well, duh... of course he is.” He's accomplished things no other quarterback has accomplished through his first three seasons, and while he's had a lot of help, the Seahawks weren't going to win all those games and reach the Super Bowl twice with Tarvaris Jackson, Charlie Whitehurst or Matt Flynn under center. Wilson's asking price has gone way up in fantasy drafts as well. A player who was barely being drafted as a weekly starter a year ago is now going ahead of Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints. And that's no bueno. As things stand right now, fantasy owners are counting on Wilson bettering last year's career stats just to justify his asking price. Not exceed, mind you—justify. And this is a quarterback for the team that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL in 2014. Yes, much of Wilson's fantasy production is tied to his ability to hurt teams with his legs. But consider this—assuming that the Seahawks and Wilson do agree to an extension, do you think the team that just invested well over $100 million in Wilson is going to want him to carry the ball 118 times in 2015? Wilson's a great young player and a fine fantasy option. But with a top-five sticker price? Pass. Average Draft Position: RB20 (44th overall) You aren't going to get any argument that Todd Gurley is a talented, young running back. You won't get much that he's the best rookie ball-carrier to come down the pipe in some time. Mike Mayock of the NFL Network lauded the Rams' selection of Gurley with the No. 10 overall pick, comparing the 6'1\", 221-pounder to Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks: I like the Marshawn Lynch comparison. St. Louis wants to win games the same way that Seattle and San Francisco do in the same division, that is by running the football and playing great defense and special teams. Gurley has Olympic-type speed. I love this pick for St. Louis, which already has a great defense and Gurley will help out Nick Foles. It would appear that fantasy owners agree. Last year, Bishop Sankey of the Tennessee Titans was chosen as the first rookie running back in fantasy drafts, with an average draft position at My Fantasy League of RB25. Gurley is coming off the board a full five slots higher, ahead of veterans like Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers and Joique Bell of the Detroit Lions. There's just one problem—one huge, glaring problem. Gurley tore his ACL last November while at Georgia. Yes, the recovery time for such an injury isn't what it used to be. And reports from Rams' camp have been almost universally positive. However, even if Gurley is ready to rock for Week 1, as Thomas Emerick of Sporting News points out, we're likely to see a lot of second-year pro Tre Mason, at least early in the season: Fisher's approach to managing Gurley's workload will set the ceiling for September and October, where we'll probably see a snap limit and heavy dose of Mason. Gurley owners will hope this step takes place in August. St. Louis also drafted four desperately needed offensive linemen, and this run offense will depend on a young line jelling together and finding starters by fire. With Mason in the fold, there's no reason for the Rams to rush Gurley. And yet he's being drafted like a Week 1 bell cow. Those who pull that trigger better hope it turns out better than Sankey in 2014. Average Draft Position: WR16 (41st overall) There may not be a more hyped player in all of fantasy football than New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Keith Lipscomb of ESPN was one of any number of pundits who have gushed about Cooks' potential as the new No. 1 receiver in the Big Easy: I think the Saints are going to turn up the volume in Cooks' game in his sophomore season. In his first five games, he averaged just 4.1 yards at the catch (how far downfield he caught the ball), but in his final five games before his injury, that number was 12.0. You know the Saints still want to throw the football but don't have their top-two pass-catchers from last season. Cooks is a dynamic talent, and this season he'll get every opportunity to show the masses, including more chances to make plays down the field. It isn't just fantasy types, either. Chris Wesseling of NFL.com also wrote that Cooks could be on the verge of a breakout in his second NFL season: Now that Jimmy Graham and Kenny Stills have been shipped off to Seattle and Miami, respectively, there could be as many as 175-200 targets up for grabs in the Saints' aerial attack. With only a declining Marques Colston ahead of him in the pecking order, Cooks is sure to be a featured player after dominating offseason practices. And it's possible that breakout could happen. Cooks showed himself to be dangerous in the open field last year before a broken thumb ended his season, and with both Stills and especially Graham gone, someone is going to have to pick up the slack. The problem is that with all the buzz surrounding Cooks, his ADP has been steadily climbing. A player with one season of 550 receiving yards is being taken as a high-end fantasy WR2. And for Lipscomb's colleague Field Yates, that cost is just too high: There's a lot to like about Brandin Cooks' game, as he's shifty, elusive and a menace to tackle in open space. But he plays a position -- slot receiver -- that isn't often conducive to finding the end zone frequently. He's slotted as our 16th wide receiver, but I simply think the lack of touchdowns will be an issue from a fantasy perspective. The issue isn't even Cooks per se. It's the hype that's sucked all the value from a player now being drafted far closer to his fantasy ceiling than the floor. Average Draft Position: TE6 (75th overall) OK, so \"hype\" may not exactly be the best word to describe the buzz surrounding Julius Thomas, especially in fantasy circles. In fact, he needs a hug. Evan Silva's comments about Thomas over at Yahoo Sports more-or-less sum up the fantasy community's feelings about Thomas moving to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency this year: Julius Thomas was easily the biggest fantasy \"loser\" of this year's free agency period, going from a Broncos offense that ranked first and second in the NFL in scoring in 2013 and 2014, to a Jags team that finished 32nd and 32nd in those seasons. While Thomas may prove a useful real-life pickup for Jacksonville, the bottom could fall out on his fantasy production. I told you he needed a hug. Although that $9 million a season the Jaguars forked over probably makes the 27-year-old feel a little bit better. If I need to explain to you why going from the fantasy penthouse that is Peyton Manning in Denver to the fantasy outhouse that is Jacksonville and Blake Bortles, then might I recommend fantasy bowling? I hear fantasy cricket is—whatever happens during a cricket jiminy or whatever it's called. And yet Thomas is still being selected sixth at the tight end spot on average. That's ahead of Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles, who could be set for a big uptick in targets this year. Ahead of Jordan Cameron of the Miami Dolphins, who has the added advantage of an honest-to-goodness NFL quarterback throwing him passes in Ryan Tannehill. And far ahead of veteran Owen Daniels, who replaced Thomas in Denver. Have these people seen Bortles and the Jaguars play? Average Draft Position: D/ST1 (68th overall) From an NFL perspective, there's no arguing that the Seattle Seahawks have one of the NFL's very best defenses. In 2014, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. The year before, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. Scoring defense? First in 2014. First in 2013. Two years ago, all was well. The Seahawks also ranked fourth in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. Not great, but nothing to cry about. Last year? Tears galore. The Seahawks free-fell to 23rd. The change was brought about by big plays—or more appropriately, the lack of them. The Seahawks dropped from eighth in the NFL in sacks two seasons ago to 20th in 2014. In 2013, the Seahawks ranked fourth in takeaways. Last year, that number plummeted to 21st. Yes, those numbers could rebound in 2015. Or not. It's not as if the Seahawks made big upgrades to the pass rush in the offseason, and turnovers are a fluky stat. Spending a sixth-round pick (in a 12-team fantasy football league) on any team defense isn't advisable. Spending one on a fantasy defense (that finished outside the top 20 a year ago) because it's a great NFL defense is even worse. It's falling for the hype.

    "DiffbotBody": "Lisa Kohl, a 27-year-old corporate executive in Munich, has watched the ceaseless debate over the latest bailout package for Greece with concern. The COO of a German market research company, Kohl said she already pays high taxes as a single person with no children, and many Germans worry that further economic unraveling in Greece could cost Germany more money. “If we continue paying, what are we paying for?” said Kohl, echoing what she described as the sentiment of many in Germany. Kohl is one of many young Germans closely watching the debate over a solution for Greece. German millennials are part of the first generation to grow up in the single currency eurozone, and they have seen their country serve as a European Union leader for years. As unmarried young people without children, they often pay high taxes, and see themselves as bankrolling a large chunk of Greece's debt. Many are deeply invested in the situation in Greece, but are divided over whether the German government should express solidarity with their fellow Europeans in Athens or continue to take a firm stance on Greece repaying its debt. In January, 61 percent of Germans were in favor of Greece leaving the Eurozone, according to poll data. The same poll reported that 68 percent were against debt forgiveness and that 4 out of 5 people polled favored strict austerity measures. By late Thursday, the Greek government had bent considerably toward the German position, proposing a fresh bailout in exchange for accepting a broad package of spending cuts. Yet if a deal fails to materialize or if it comes without forgiveness for the enormous debts the Greek government now shoulders, many young Germans fear that they will ultimately be the ones paying the bills. Some of the fear concerning higher taxes may be unfounded, since the German government owns only a portion of Greece’s debt -- the rest of it being held by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and other governments and private banks throughout Europe. But private entities now only own 17 percent of Greece’s debt and European governments hold the lion's share: almost 62 percent of 322 billion euros. The German government has the highest stake of those Euro-area governments, making German taxpayers responsible for 65 billion euros, according to Bloomberg. “Greece Is Mocking The Rest Of Europe” Discussions surrounding debt forgiveness and the possibility of additional loans to Greece have long raged in Germany, given their large stake in Greek debt. These debates were stoked by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ visit to Strasbourg on Wednesday, where he discussed an additional 3-year loan proposal with European creditors. The new deal that Tsipras has put on the table involves a 53.5 billion euro bailout in exchange for budget and spending cuts. Young Germans have been less affected by the recession that has walloped Europe in recent years. Germany has the lowest youth unemployment rate in the European Union, while Greece’s number of unemployed young people is the second highest in the region, trailing only Spain. Still, many young Germans who are pro-austerity said they were worried Greece’s financial troubles could hurt their futures. Many talked about the need for safe spending when it comes to Greece. \"Younger people are not necessarily angry, but they feel that everything that has been done in the past two, three and four years has been for nothing -- that all the money has been wasted that could’ve been put into much better use,” said Ferdinand Vogel, 23, a student and German National Guard trainee officer who writes the current events blog “Young German.” Vogel, who lives in Berlin, said Greece needed to take more responsibility for its actions before debt forgiveness could even be put on the table. “If Greece wants to stay in the EU, it should abide by the standards of the EU,\" he said. Torsten Heinrich, 32, a writer and former youth organizer for the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, said he was fed up with the empty promises made by Tsipiras’ Syriza-led government. “Greece is mocking the rest of Europe,” said Heinrich, of Wurzburg in southern Germany. “They have promised reforms; they haven’t done anything. Instead they are asking for more money and more money ... Patience is running out.” Heinrich said he supported debt forgiveness, but only because he thought it was inevitable. “The Greeks will never be able to pay [their loans] back,” he said. Continuing Faith In The European Project Critics of Germany’s hard stance on Greece’s debt crisis, however, point to Germany’s experiences with debt forgiveness after World War II as an example of how the German government has acted hypocritically toward Greece in the past five years. In 1953, with the London Debt Agreement, Germany was forgiven around 50 percent of the debts it had incurred during reconstruction following the war. One of the major signatories of this European agreement was Greece. The agreement, in conjunction with the Marshall Plan, which provided multiple billions of dollars to post-war Germany, kept the German economy from being strangled by debt and allowed it to become the strongest economy in Europe today. People line up to buy rare goods on Berlin's market, during the Berlin occidental zone blockade by Russia, in June 1948. JEAN MANZON/AFP/Getty Images In fact, one of Tsipiras' first official acts as prime minister was to suggest that Germany pay reparations to Greece for the destruction caused when the country was occupied during the Second World War -- a move that outraged Merkel. Germany’s unforgiving tone toward Greece these days is ironic, said Timothy Guinnane, a professor of historical economics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who has written about the London Debt Agreement of 1953. “In 1953, the poor Greeks were helping the rich Germans,” he said in a phone interview. Many young Germans understand the crisis through this kind of solidarity. Julian Greth, 24, an engineering student from Munich, described the Greek population as the “victims” of the crisis -- not the Germans. He also said that everything in Europe was connected and that the EU could not simply kick Greece out without any broader repercussions. His stake in Greece is more than one of a future taxpayer. Greth is somewhat of a Grecophile and has traveled to Greece four times on vacation. “As a country, it’s still the same -- friendly, helpful,” he said of his recent experience in Greece. Matthias Adler, a 34 year-old freelance writer from Berlin, argued that Greeks deserve Germany’s financial and emotional support. Adler was born and raised in Berlin by left-wing parents and said that a good deal of his politics and those of his friends who share his views stem from their geographic location and their upbringing. The politics of south Germany, he said, tended to be more conservative and pro-austerity by comparison. From Adler’s perspective, Greece leaving the EU is unimaginable. He said he couldn't understand the fierce anger many Germans felt toward Greeks and that he would continue to stand in solidarity with them. “In my opinion, it’s not a Greek problem, it’s a European problem,” he said. “We Germans are the ones who have profited the most from this whole European Union, and I hope we don’t forget that.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "This past holiday weekend, American pop star Ariana Grande was filmed licking some donuts in a California bakery and then casually expressing her hatred for America. Grande has since apologized for the comments, but failed to acknowledge the donut-licking incident. While her actions were undeniably gross, we can’t help but wonder if licking someone else’s food is actually a public health concern. Saliva gets a bad rap for being gross, and rightfully so; it’s literally filled with bacteria and viruses. “The mouth is a perfect environment for growing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It’s warm and dark, food goes in there several times a day, and there are lots of little nooks and crannies where food can get caught,” said dentist and oral microbiologist Donna Mager, of the Forsyth Institute, a nonprofit group that focuses on oral and craniofacial research, as reported by Discover Magazine. Some of the most common diseases which can spread through saliva are strep throat, the common cold, mumps, meningitis, herpes, mononucleosis, and more rare conditions such as foot-and-mouth disease, The Huffington Post reported. With that being said, just because saliva is filled with germs does not necessarily mean it’s particularly dangerous. Ever wonder why animals instinctively lick their wounds? It could be that Fido is onto something that we’ve overlooked. Along with germs and pathogens, saliva is also filled with unique antibodies and antimicrobial compounds that help to disable these germs and viruses. Even HIV can be destroyed by oral antibodies, which is why it’s nearly impossible to pass on the virus through saliva. Most of the bacteria in the mouth are anaerobic, meaning they cannot survive long in the presence of oxygen, or in the case of obligate anaerobes, cannot survive at all once they hit air. Some common examples of anaerobic bacteria include E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and C. botulinum. While each of these bacteria have different lifespans once they leave a body, one thing is for sure: Once they hit the air, the clock starts ticking. This means that, depending on the amount of time between Grande’s infamous donut licks and when that donut was eaten by an unsuspecting customer, the large majority of bacteria could have quite possibly died off quite soon after the moisture from her saliva dried up. Now while bacteria may be sensitive to the outside world, viruses, on the other hand, are quite resilient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B can survive outside the body for at least seven days and still be capable of causing infection. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service reports that cold viruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for more than a week. Flu viruses have a shorter outside lifespan of only around a day, and stomach bugs, such as the norovirus, can last for weeks. With that being said, however, the effectiveness of the virus starts to decrease after about 24 hours of being outside of a host, so not too much cause for concern. Regardless of the public health risk licking donuts may be, health authorities aren’t taking any chances. The bakery, Wolfee Donuts in California has reportedly received a docked health grade a day after the incidence was released to the public, and according to Perez Hilton, the Riverside Department of Environmental Health is currently investigating the incident and reviewing whether or not it is in violation of health codes. Considering that everything from diarrhea-inducing listeria to glass was found in food this year, a pint-sized pop star’s saliva is probably the very least of our concerns.",

Celeb hair stylist Nikki Lee softly French-braided two sections of the actress's hair across the back of her head in a diagonal direction. Below that, she took two more sections and knotted them together, then joined the knot and French braid together with a rubber band. To finish the look, she spritzed on Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray to hold the style in place. This braid may just be her \"crowning\" style moment of the summer!

    "DiffbotBody": "FORT MILL, S.C. With a $103.8 million contract extension, Cam Newton could do just about anything he wanted for vacation. But on Friday, much like a decent chunk of the summer, the Carolina Panthers’ franchise quarterback was on a high school field hosting a 7-on-7 tournament. The second annual 7-on-7 championship hosted by his foundation is this weekend at Nation Ford High. While Newton has been able to get away some this offseason, he’s spent five weekends since Memorial Day with hundreds of high school football players at his tournaments. Isn’t it good sometimes to just get away from football, though? “To a degree,” Newton said Friday, less than three weeks from the start of Panthers training camp in Spartanburg. “But it just depends. Some people like work and enjoy doing what they do. And they don’t consider what some may consider work. It’s just a passion. It’s something that I’ve always had the passion and will to do. I don’t look at it as work. I look at it as, this is my off time and what better to do than to give back.” This weekend is the culmination of two months worth of tournaments in four different states. Qualifying teams from two Atlanta 7-on-7 tournaments, one Charlotte tournament and one in Alabama descended on Nation Ford. One will be crowned as the foundation’s champion on Saturday. On Thursday, Newton hosted the 400-some players on a trip to Carowinds. The foundation paid for buses and overnight stays for out-of-town teams. They planned to go bowling on Montford Drive on Friday night before championship Saturday. “Anytime I can become a beneficiary to somebody else, that’s my main purpose. For me, football is my life,” Newton said. “It’s what I’ve done. It’s what I’ve been doing for so long that when I see kids like this that are hungry and yearning just to dream and hoping for an opportunity, and if they do right by themselves and listen to coaching, they can do it. I’m just trying to be an outlet, a resource, for these kids and be there if need be.” Since the start of the Panthers’ organized team activities and minicamp, Newton has spent most of his free weekends at either his tournaments or a tournament at IMG Academy in Florida. Last week he went to Australia as part of a Gatorade player exchange program, learning from the Richmond Tigers about Australian Rules Football. Newton admitted he’s not the best at “footy” and plans to stick to American football, but he brought back tips from the players on preparation and work ethic. Last season, Newton funded a three-day trip to Greensboro for about a dozen teammates to train at receivers coach Ricky Proehl’s facility before training camp. That was also when Newton was working with a reworked receiving corps. While the hope was to return to Greensboro for another training session, a team source said that’s unlikely this summer. A source close to Newton indicated he will travel next week to Baltimore to train at Under Armour’s facilities. Before that, he will host the 15 teams, including two from North Carolina (Hough and South Mecklenburg). Friday he danced, sang, challenged players to throwing matches and stayed focused on games being played on either side of the field. “That boy is going to be special,” Newton said of one player after he made a touchdown catch in the corner of the end zone. Newton’s participation didn’t go unnoticed by the coaches at the tournament. “I got coaches that wanted to come today so they could see Cam Newton,” Dorman (S.C.) coach Dave Gutshall said. “He has a personality where everyone likes him. In fact he’s a big kid sometimes. It’s great. Obviously he’s a superstar in the NFL, and it means a lot for the kids to be here.” Said Newton: “I’m just trying to give back to these kids. I’m trying to take the Panthers to the Super Bowl. In any way, shape, form or fashion I’m trying to make myself a better person and better player by the day.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "HOLLY SPRINGS The three-car garage is a popular amenity at 12 Oaks, a burgeoning golf course community with 500 homes sold and hundreds more on the way. A nearby Starbucks is geared to serve car people, too. They were stacked seven deep in the drive-thru lane Friday at mid-morning, while a single walk-in customer ordered coffee – no waiting – inside. The Triangle Expressway has spurred vigorous suburban development in the past few years in Holly Springs and southern Apex, reflected in steadily rising traffic on the state’s first modern toll road. The state Department of Transportation is banking on continued growth with a construction project that is expected to attract more paying customers for TriEx. DOT awarded an $18.4 million contract this week to build a new interchange at Old Holly Springs-Apex Road, barely a mile from the exits at U.S. 1 and N.C. 55. With similar hopes, DOT and the town of Cary are planning to build another new TriEx interchange at Morrisville Parkway, about 8 miles north of the Old Holly Springs-Apex Road interchange, in 2017. Both roads were too puny to warrant their own exits when TriEx opened for traffic in phases from December 2011 to December 2012. But turnpike planners kept their options open. A red-brick bridge for Morrisville Parkway was included with the original construction, and that’s all it is today: just a bridge, with grass and pines growing wild at each end. The parkway has not reached TriEx, yet. As for Old Holly Springs-Apex Road, it’s a two-lane, wooded country lane that, as recently as 2010, carried fewer than 2,000 cars a day on a bridge over TriEx. But things have changed. New neighborhoods including the 600-acre 12 Oaks are blossoming nearby, on the south side of TriEx. Just to the north, the planned 1,100-acre Veridea development is expected to bring retail, offices and urban densities along with housing for hundreds of families. By 2035, DOT engineers say, Old Holly Springs-Apex Road will handle 34,000 cars a day, and a lot of them will use the toll road. “We’re excited that they have let the contract, and looking forward to getting the interchange open,” said Tom Hendrickson, the Veridea developer. The six-lane, 18.8-mile expressway stretches N.C. 147 south from Interstate 40 in Research Triangle Park and extends the 540 Outer Loop south from N.C. 54 through Cary and Apex to N.C. 55 at Holly Springs. The nation was deep in recession when the N.C. Turnpike Authority borrowed $1 billion and started building TriEx in 2009 and forecasts for traffic and revenues were conservative. Traffic counts have risen almost every month. The busiest part of TriEx, on N.C. 540 between N.C. 147 and N.C. 55, recorded an average weekday count of 37,160 cars in March – up from 32,800 last year and 25,900 in 2013. Turnpike officials expected to collect $17.6 million in fiscal year 2014, but they took in $19.7 million. “As a result of the Triangle Expressway, we’re seeing an explosion of growth around the facility,” said Beau Memory, the turnpike authority’s executive director. “These additional (interchanges) will be additional links to that growth.” Morrisville Parkway started out as a line on a planning map, extending west from Cary into woods and pastures that are quickly being subsumed by subdivisions. The road has been built in pieces by developers, with a gap remaining in the middle. West of TriEx, it dead-ends in the Greystone neighborhood. To the east, Oaks at Highcroft. Cary and DOT are developing a project to fill in the remaining 1.8 miles of Morrisville Parkway, bring it across the bridge that already bears its name, and add ramps and electronic toll gantries to make it the freeway’s 13th interchange. Cary officials hope to start construction in 2017, with traffic streaming down the completed road in 2018. Starting in late 2016, the new interchange at Old Holly Springs-Apex Road will bring the toll road five or 10 minutes closer for hundreds of Apex and Holly Springs homeowners. And for southbound drivers who previously would have used the exit farther south at N.C. 55, the new option will cut the toll by 17 cents. The toll road is a selling point for homebuyers here. “A lot of people are looking at 12 Oaks now,” said David G. Mason of Holly Springs, a regional vice president for Landeavor, a Florida real-estate firm that is developing 12 Oaks. “A few years ago they might have considered Holly Springs a little too far out to meet their needs to go to Research Triangle Park or North Raleigh. “Now they can be anywhere in 20 minutes,” Mason said. “It puts Holly Springs on the map, for people who choose to use the toll road.” Residents across southern Wake County are awaiting a decision on which path the state Department of Transportation will choose for the southern extension of the Triangle Expressway from N.C. 55 at Holly Springs to Interstate 40 near Garner. The proposed path marked by road planners in the 1990s, now called the Orange Route, runs through sensitive wetlands and the habitat of an endangered mussel. Pressed by federal environmental regulators, DOT has agreed to study alternatives that would avoid the protected wetlands. Garner and other southern Wake towns have endorsed the Orange Route and have criticized the primary alternative, the Red Route, because it would run through parks, businesses and residential neighborhoods. A draft environmental impact statement, expected to be released in late July, will evaluate the impacts of each possible route.",

    "DiffbotBody": "At the end of June, the Greek government instituted capital controls — limits on how much money can be drawn from banks — after negotiations with the eurozone broke down and the country's fiscal and monetary lifelines disappeared. Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With just one former winner in this year’s field, the 2015 Home Run Derby is likely to have a first-time champion. A few days before this year’s contest, the runner-up in the 2014 Derby is the favorite to win the title during MLB's All-Star break. Todd Frazier (7/2) has been given the best betting odds at Bovada.lv to win the competition, leading the rest of the contestants. The Cincinnati Reds third baseman was a longshot to win the title last year, but he made it all the way to the finals, falling to back-to-back champion Yoenis Cespedes. After hitting a career-high 29 home runs in 2014, Frazier has emerged as one of MLB’s top power hitters. His 25 home runs are the second-most of any player in the 2015 Derby, and he tails Giancarlo Stanton by just two home runs for the Major-League lead. Kris Bryant (5/1) is the second favorite, even though he has fewer home runs than any other contestant this season. He’s one of just two players in the field that doesn’t have at least 16 home runs and rank no worse than 21st in the Majors. The Chicago Cubs rookie has 12 dingers, though he didn’t start the season in the big leagues. He’s averaging a home run in nearly every 23 at-bats. The only contestant that’s won the competition before is Prince Fielder (11/2), having taken home the trophy in both 2009 and 2012. He’s having one of his worst home-run seasons of his career with just 13 long balls, but the designated hitter has been terrific for the Texas Rangers in 2015. His .345 batting average is second in the American League, and only Frazier and Bryant have better odds to win the Derby. Albert Pujols (6/1) is the AL leader with 26 home runs, topping every other contestant. He’s competed in the event three times, never winning and having his best finish 12 years ago when he came in second place behind Garrett Anderson. Chicago is the only team that has two representatives in the contest. Bryant has better odds than Anthony Rizzo (13/2), even though the first baseman has hit four more home runs than his teammate. Joc Pederson, Josh Donaldson and Manny Machado are all tied for having the worst odds (7/1) of anyone in Monday’s competition. Pederson has 20 home runs and he's a leading candidate, along with Bryant, to be named the National League Rookie of the Year. Donaldson has 21 home runs, and he’s in the conversation for AL MVP. Machado’s 19 home runs are already a career-high. Along with Frazier, Donaldson competed in last year’s Home Run Derby. He didn’t make it out of the first round, hitting just three long balls. Giancarlo Stanton, Mike Trout and Bryce Harper are among the notable names that won't be in the 2015 Derby.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Growing up in Turkey in the 1990s, the whole live music scene was dominated by cover bands that played hits from the United States and Europe. It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. But when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was. So I went back and listened to them—and was blown away. Listen to a playlist featuring Turkish artists covered in this story: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the music scene in Turkey flourished, producing local legends including Erkin Koray and Selda Bağcan. But a military coup in 1980 put a definite hold on the arts. There was not much happening besides pop music for a while, but a strong metal scene appeared in the ‘90s, including bands which formed the base for long running acts like Replikas, Nekropsi, and Daire 2: General Gramafon. The Internet then spurred on a new wave of vibrancy within the country's music scene, and underground musicians started to embrace their own roots and write their lyrics in Turkish. Peyote, a music venue located in the heart of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, became the first venue to exclusively book bands with original music, giving way to a healthy artistic community. Musicians in Turkey still face drawbacks on a daily basis: There are still only a handful of venues that host non-cover bands, with bigger venues only booking foreign acts (and not offering local groups support slots), and lots of music festivals have been cancelled due to new government regulations that prevent alcohol sponsorships. But these obstacles have brought bands together as they collectively work to book shows, open DIY venues, and do their own street festivals. Members of Istanbul’s music scene outside Roxy, one of the city's oldest venues for rock shows There are only a few cities in Turkey with music venues, and getting visas to play shows in Europe can be difficult, so touring is not really an option for most underground bands. But the economic inviability of making a living entirely from music—as well as the diminished chances of any type of rock stardom—has effectively eliminated certain types of musicians, leaving behind only the ones who are 100% dedicated to what they do. Right now, despite all the roadblocks in the way, there is an incredibly lively DIY music scene in Turkey, filled with talented musicians. I asked nearly 20 of these artists to take me where they feel at home in Istanbul and talked to them about the current state of the music scene. The journey led me through rehearsal spaces and tea gardens, alleyways and festive feasts.",

    "DiffbotBody": "We'd love to have a weekly date night, but who in the world is going to watch the kids? Yes, there will come a time when you will need a babysitter. It may seem hard to fathom (why would you ever leave your little angels?), but it's true. Perhaps it's a necessity like a doctor's appointment or the 2 p.m. matinee, but the fact remains — you need a babysitter. Read: How to spot a great babysitter Take a deep breath, and don't be terrified; there are ways to find your own personal Mary Poppins. Asking the right questions is key (as is knowing what some babysitters do when you're gone). Having this crucial intel can help you find someone who doesn't take advantage of the situation. In general, err on the side of caution; have a short phone interview or in-person conversation (with the kids there) to see how everyone gets along. It may seem old fashioned, but ask for references. Several online babysitting agencies make their applicants go through a background check; you could hire through one of these to know what your sitter's history is. Hiring someone who is CPR certified may also come in handy. Be sure to know if your sitter has a medical condition (like frequent seizures) that could possibly put your child in danger. It seems like a lot, but these are your kids we are talking about! If you are trusting someone with your children, you should know as much as you can about them in order to find a good fit for your family. Here are six things to keep an eye out for, but more importantly, how to find someone you'll feel completely comfortable leaving your kids with. 1. #Pooltime Social media can be a great asset for a babysitter (hello Pinterest), but it can also pull their attention away from watching your kids. How is your caretaker supposed to be taking care of your child if Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are more of a priority? Be candid about how your sitter uses social media. Ask to keep cell phones and other gadgets out of site while the kids are awake, and to not post photos of your children online without your permission. 2. Party at your place It can be unnerving enough having someone in your house to watch your kids, let alone their boyfriend, friends and siblings too. There's no way that your child will be first priority when your babysitter is focused on having a night in with friends. Don't be afraid to come off as controlling when you ask that no one is to come over while you are away. Your sitter may be wonderful, but there's no way of knowing that their friends are. Maybe asking a neighbor to keep an eye out for a potential party is a good option if you are feeling wary. 3. Extra toppings — on the house! Just because you've left some \"just in case\" cash on the counter doesn't give permission for a babysitting free for all; and having the parents gone doesn't mean rules go out the window. It's not unreasonable to ask a babysitter to put kids down at a regular bedtime, keep a schedule and have something other than ice cream and cake for dinner. Knowing exactly what amount of cash you've left behind and asking for receipts for purchased items can help avoid some financial mishaps. To make sure their night in goes as planned, leave a list out or a schedule to keep everyone on the same page. 4. \"But my dad says ... \" When parents are home, the little rug-rats know that they aren't the boss … but when a babysitter is over? Kids may think that things have changed. Even if your child knows that they aren't allowed to eat on the couch, does your sitter? It seems exhaustive, but making a list of house rules can help avoid some unnecessary drama when you come home. If your sitter knows what's to be expected, she can firmly answer \"No\" if kids try to bend the rules. 5. Tonight's season finale Yes, the kids may be sleeping, but it's still not a great time to catch the season finale of a not-so-PG TV show. It's hard to know who is watching from the top of the stairs, or learning a new \"vocabulary\" word or two while the season finale is streaming. As a parent, don't just toss out \"Use the TV and computer if you'd like\" offer, unless you mean it. Suggest that your sitter brings a book to read until you get home if you're not so sure what sort of thing your kids might be exposed to. 6. Negligence This can be kind of major (like forgetting to pick someone up from soccer practice) or a minor mishap (skipping important things like naps and snacks). Of course, negligence can be even more serious; signs of child abuse should be handled immediately … but hopefully these questions and getting a background check can prevent that from happening. Of course, you and your sitter should trust each other, but there may be times where your child can tell you more than your babysitter does. If your child seems to be excessively tired, hungry or generally unkempt when you return home, it's time to find a new sitter. If you do your research, you can avoid the worry that comes with having a babysitter over. Try having a little \"test run\" period, where you are only gone for 30 minutes or so, and then spend the rest of the afternoon talking with your sitter and playing with the kids. And don't forget to follow your gut; if you don't feel good about something, your motherly instinct is kicking in. But doing your research can help you find someone truly supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

In general, err on the side of caution; have a short phone interview or in-person conversation (with the kids there) to see how everyone gets along. It may seem old fashioned, but ask for references. Several online babysitting agencies make their applicants go through a background check; you could hire through one of these to know what your sitter's history is. Hiring someone who is CPR certified may also come in handy. Be sure to know if your sitter has a medical condition (like frequent seizures) that could possibly put your child in danger. It seems like a lot, but these are your kids we are talking about! If you are trusting someone with your children, you should know as much as you can about them in order to find a good fit for your family. Here are six things to keep an eye out for, but more importantly, how to find someone you'll feel completely comfortable leaving your kids with.",

(MICHAEL PATRICK/NEWS SENTINEL) Maryville lawyer Kevin Shepherd said that by filing a class-action lawsuit Friday, his clients hope to advocate for the 5,000 residents evacuated from their homes during the July 2 CSX train derailment in Blount County. Shepherd’s office filed the lawsuit at 3:10 p.m. Friday in the circuit court for Blount County, with married couple Kelli and Aaron Johnson listed as plaintiffs. Shepherd said the Johnsons, whom he knew personally before acting as their lawyer, have two children younger than 2 and live within the 2-mile radius evacuated during the derailment, though not in the area immediately affected by the spill of the chemical acrylonitrile the derailed tanker was carrying. Shepherd said the Johnsons, who were not available for comment Friday, had no personal medical injuries that they were aware of. He expects individual suits to be filed by people who were hospitalized, he said, and hopes for “long-range medical monitoring” of potential health effects from the chemical. He also noted CSX is compensating residents for business loss and expenses associated with evacuation. Continue reading at the Knoxville News Sentinel. comments powered by Disqus",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Confederate battle flag is gone from the South Carolina State House. The white-bordered, square banner bearing the St. Andrews cross was lowered for the last time Friday in front of the Confederate Soldier Monument by an honor guard of seven S.C. Highway Patrol officers. They folded and rolled up the four-foot flag. Troopers walked to the north steps and handed the flag handed to Allen Roberson, director of the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum, where the banner will eventually go on display. The flag was driven to the museum by police escort a mile west on Gervais Street from the State House. The seven-minute ceremony that drew thousands of onlookers who filled sidewalks and lawns on the north side of the State House and spilled into Gervais Street. Some in the crowd chanted shortly before the event, “Take it down.” Cheers rose when the troopers started to make their way to the flagpole along the lawn that separates the north stairs and the solider monument. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley watched the historic ceremony from the Capitol steps with former Govs. David Beasley and Jim Hodges. They saw ended an era when the flag came down at 10:09 a.m. The Confederate battle flag had flown at the Capitol for more the five decades after being raised to honor the 100-year anniversary of the Civil War, which started at Fort Sumter in Charleston. The flag remained atop the State House dome under the United States and South Carolina flags as the South wrestled against federal civil rights measures. Some South Carolina state lawmakers and activists spent years trying to remove the flag from South Carolina’s most prominent building. They won a compromise in 2000 when the Confederate flag was taken off the dome and a battle banner was raised at the solider monument along Gervais Street. The flag was removed for good after the shooting deaths of nine African-American churchgoers at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church last month. The tragedy that shocked the nation prompted Haley to call for the flag’s banishment. State lawmakers joined her. They voted this week to banish the banner despite objections from some legislators who argued the flag and other symbols of the Confederacy did not represent that hate demonstrated by the accused shooter. The influence of the Charleston tragedy was evident during the Confederate flag ceremony Friday. Haley and the former governors were joined by Charleston Mayor Joe Riley and Rev. Norvel Goff — who has taken over at Emanuel after its pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, perished in the shootings on June 17. The same state Highway Patrol color guard that took down the flag escorted Pinckney’s casket to lay at rest inside the State House last month. State Rep. Gary Clary, a retired Circuit Court judge from Pickens and freshman Republican lawmaker who was among the first legislators to call for the flag to come down in the wake of the shooting, brought his 13-year-old grandson Conner Pederson to witness the momentous day. “It was just incredible to be able to witness history because that’s something that’s going to last a lifetime,” Pederson said. Clary said that now South Carolina can focus on important issues such as roads, education, mental health and economic development. “This allows us to move forward into the 21st century,” he said. Later Friday, State House crews will remove the last visible remains of the flag. The 30-foot flagpole and decorative black iron fence will be taken down at 2 p.m.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A team of researchers from MIT have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code. It turns out software and fruit have something in common: they both can rot. But while a banana that’s been sitting out too long can’t turn fresh again, old software code that no longer functions like it once did can be revitalized. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the university’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code, MIT said this week. This is a big deal for companies that might spend thousands of dollars on developers to restore old software that may not work as efficiently as it once did. Often times software programs written several years ago no longer function properly on the latest computers and hardware, explained MIT Professor Saman Amarasinghe in an interview with Fortune. The reason is because software has to be tailored to work for computers. Each time hardware technology advances and the performance of machines increases, a software program needs to get rejiggered to accommodate the changes. Typically, coders spend a lot of hours going through the program’s software to make changes, add more lines of code, and add algorithms that ensure that the software works efficiently with the hardware specs of the day. However, each time a programmer tweaks the software and adds new code, the program steadily becomes more bloated. Additionally, the algorithms and extra code used to match the software to current hardware specifications can often become invalidated as the next-generation gear launches into the market. Coders can have a difficult time removing all the extras, which leads to a program that experiences what is known as software rot. Once the code is rotten, the program as a whole can be slow as molasses and even unresponsive when you try to get it up and running. This is where the MIT researchers come in. The MIT team developed a software system called Helium that basically scans the rotten software, discovers the most crucial lines of code that the original programmers developed to make it function, and then builds a revised version of the program that works with the hardware specs that the MIT team wants it to match. What used to be a month’s long process, the MIT researchers claim can now be cut down to an hour. Amarasinghe explained that MIT tested out its Helium system with some engineers from Adobe ADBE -0.57% who were looking for ways to make the over-two-decade-old Photoshop program run faster and process images more quickly with the advancements in modern hardware tech. Whereas Google and Facebook have been running software that might be as young as three years, Adobe and other companies might have programs or applications that haven’t aged too well as the years have gone by, Amarasinghe said. In this case, the Adobe engineers wanted a way to make Photoshop run better without having to spend the traditional man-power needed to do the job. MIT claims that when they used Helium to revise Photoshop, the program’s performance increased by 75 percent. Say goodbye to the slow loading times for your favorite vacation pictures you want to make more colorful. As of now, Helium is not quite ready for primetime and it could be a few more years before it’s ready for widespread use, Amarasinghe said. Adobe was only testing out Helium and is not going to be using it in its products as of now. Also, while Helium can restore older code, it currently only works on image-processing software like Photoshop, because getting a program to display an image is a relatively easier task compared to other more complex software, he said. Still, if Helium pans out, Amarasinghe said it could have a lot of benefits to businesses. The healthcare industry, for example could save a lot of time having to upgrade their image-processing software for medical devices like X-ray machines as the hardware advances.
