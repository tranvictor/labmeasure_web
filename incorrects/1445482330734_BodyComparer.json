    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "The rumored “Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo” smartphone is back in the news after a small hiatus. According to reports, a brand-new device was spotted in the Wi-Fi interoperability certification site, and it's believed to be the S5 Neo. The smartphone entry tied to model number SM-G903F has apparently received Wi-Fi certification. When a device gets a Wi-Fi certification, the site gives away key specifications and features. Sam Mobile says the model number matches the device the site discovered earlier, so Samsung could finally be launching the Galaxy S5 Neo. As far as the key Galaxy S5 Neo specifications go, the handset will reportedly be identical to the 2014 flagship Galaxy S5 in many ways. The device will come with a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, aided by a full HD screen resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Under the hood, the Galaxy S5 Neo will reportedly be powered by a 64-bit octa-core (Samsung Exynos 7580) processor, running at 1.6 GHz. In comparison, the flagship Galaxy S5 comes powered by a Snapdragon 801 processor. Plus, the Neo will be backed by a modest 2 GB of RAM unit and the graphics side will be taken care by a Mali-T720 GPU, notes GSM Arena. On the software front, as expected, the handset will run on Android 5.1 Lollipop OS, straight out of the box. And the device will come equipped with 16 GB of in-built storage capacity. The Neo will reportedly sport a 16 MP rear-facing camera unit. In addition, it will flaunt a generous 5 MP front-facing snapper unit for selfies and video chats. Furthermore, the entire configurations will be held together and powered by a good 2,800 mAh battery unit. In addition to the standard connectivity options, the Galaxy S5 Neo will support LTE Advanced or LTE-A. Notably, the Galaxy S5 comes with only the standard LTE support. To top it all off, this Neo device will be released in single-SIM and dual-SIM models. In the meantime, an earlier rumor out of the Czech Republic stated the price of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo will be $490 equivalent. Even though this device cannot be compared to the South Korean tech giant’s Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, for a mid- to high-end handset, the specifications sounds like a good deal. Samsung has not confirmed the Galaxy S5 Neo specifications or price thus far.",

    "DiffbotBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J. She began working for museums in earnest in 2002 when she became administrator of the Readington museums, where she oversaw three 18th-century buildings depicting Colonial life in New Jersey farming communities. Hollander helped with several restoration efforts and spent a great deal of her time making history accessible to the public. She developed Hands-on History programs centered on themes such as health and hygiene in the Colonial era and traditional crafts such as barrel-making. She would also take on the persona of Vrouw Maritje Bouman, a 36-year-old mother of five in the Colonial era. Donning a white bonnet, embroidered apron and red linen bedjacket, Hollander would tell school groups what life was like in 1755 as she performed daily chores. \"I would show them that I was cooking on a hearth and ask them if they help their moms cook on a hearth,\" she recalled. \"They would say we don't have a hearth. We have a stove. I would ask them what is it? How did it get hot? Wood? Most didn't know, but by asking them questions, if forced them to think about their world.\" Hollander played the part so seriously that a student once stopped her on the street to tell her she looked just like Vrouw Bouman and ask if she was her descendant. \"She got the kids to appreciate history,\" said Margaret Smith, program director at Readington. Hollander kept their attention, she said, through hands-on activities and stories. Hollander left Readington in 2010 when the board made her job part-time and soon after started working at Clinton's Red Mill Village. With 40,000 artifacts and a 10-acre campus along the scenic south branch of the Raritan River, the mill is well suited for exhibits and special events. Hollander tapped that potential, hosting Civil War Days and Revolutionary Days, weekend festivals that featured re-enactors. She also got a quick lesson in crisis management there. The Halloween before she was hired, the nonprofit that runs the mill had transformed the historic spot to the Asylum of Terror, haunted by \"wretched souls\" tormented by \"dementia, paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviors, physical abnormalities and deformities.\" The theme drew criticism from the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma and prompted the National Alliance on Mental Illness to alert the public about the Clinton mill. Mill officials approved a safer \"zombie\" theme the year Hollander came on board and issued a public apology in the newspaper. The board would have left it at that had it not been for Hollander, said Pat Bower, a former mill board member. Hollander reached out to the alliance and the council, creating a history exhibit on how the state had treated the mentally ill. \"She used it as an opportunity to highlight the issue and engage public discussion,\" Bower said. Hollander said some didn't want the exhibit to include the state's mistreatment of the mentally ill and the prejudices held against people with mental illness. But Hollander was insistent that a full story be told, and that the mill was the right place to tell it. \"You can't learn to do things right if you don't recognize the things that happened in the past,\" she said. Hollander left Clinton three years ago for a job as assistant director of communications and outreach at the New Jersey regional office at American Jewish Committee, an advocacy nonprofit. There, she said, she learned about building connections with people and partnerships to advance a cause. Considering just a third of the National Museum of Industrial History's budget will be covered by museum tickets, she said building partnerships — in the form of sponsors, grants and memberships — will be key. She also learned at AJC that history is more significant to people if you can show its impact on people today. She believes she can do that at the National Museum of Industrial History by showing how the machines and innovations that built America continue to have an impact on the world. And here, she'll also have an opportunity to develop programs that inspire the next generation. \"That's where the truly, truly open minds are,\" Hollander said. \"To them, the sky's the limit, anything can happen.\" It takes, she said, just one historical figure, artifact or idea to inspire a future. Just as Grover's Mill did for her. About Amy Hollander Title: Executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem Age: 46 Education: Bachelor's degree in art history from Vassar College; master's degree in historic preservation from University of Pennsylvania Hometown: Windsor Township, N.J., near the storied Grover's Mill Current residence: A restored wool factory in Pohatcong, Township N.J. Fun fact: Her first date with her future husband was at Celtic Classic in Bethlehem.",
    "LabBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Hype can be a dangerous thing in fantasy football. Sure, it's great to know who this year's rising stars and hot sleepers are. The problem begins when everyone starts reading the same reports. Writing their own takes based on those reports. Targeting the same players based on what they've read and/or written. That, in turn, drives up the asking price of those sleepers and value plays. A running back who was being drafted close to his fantasy floor rises nearer to his ceiling. That late-round lottery ticket wideout goes from $1 scratcher to one of those big, shiny ones that cost 20 bucks. In 2014, everyone and their mother (hi Mom!) were convinced that San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green was going to take the reins from Antonio Gates. Green's Average Draft Position rose steadily throughout the summer, to the point he was drafted ahead of the future Hall of Famer. Well, Gates caught 12 touchdowns and finished as a top-five tight end in most scoring systems. Green caught 19 passes all season long. With that cautionary tale in mind, here are a handful of players for whom hype levels are redlining in 2015. Begin Slideshow » Average Draft Position: QB4 (37th overall) I will be the first person to admit that I'm an unabashed fan of Seattle Seahawks quarterback . My admiration for him as a player borders on man-crush levels. And Wilson is coming off a phenomenal season, both from an NFL and fantasy football perspective. Wilson set career highs in passing yards (3,475), rushing yards (849) and rushing touchdowns (six) en route to leading the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Wilson also posted the best fantasy finish of his three-year career, finishing fifth at his position in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. With Wilson headed into the final year of his rookie deal, there has been speculation that Wilson could be set to become the highest-paid player in NFL history. Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated might not be willing to go quite that far, but you'll get no argument from him that Wilson's worth a whole lotta money: Is Russell Wilson a franchise quarterback? I would posit that the answer lies somewhere between “Yes” and “Well, duh... of course he is.” He's accomplished things no other quarterback has accomplished through his first three seasons, and while he's had a lot of help, the Seahawks weren't going to win all those games and reach the Super Bowl twice with Tarvaris Jackson, Charlie Whitehurst or Matt Flynn under center. Wilson's asking price has gone way up in fantasy drafts as well. A player who was barely being drafted as a weekly starter a year ago is now going ahead of Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints. And that's no bueno. As things stand right now, fantasy owners are counting on Wilson bettering last year's career stats just to justify his asking price. Not exceed, mind you—justify. And this is a quarterback for the team that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL in 2014. Yes, much of Wilson's fantasy production is tied to his ability to hurt teams with his legs. But consider this—assuming that the Seahawks and Wilson do agree to an extension, do you think the team that just invested well over $100 million in Wilson is going to want him to carry the ball 118 times in 2015? Wilson's a great young player and a fine fantasy option. But with a top-five sticker price? Pass. Average Draft Position: RB20 (44th overall) You aren't going to get any argument that Todd Gurley is a talented, young running back. You won't get much that he's the best rookie ball-carrier to come down the pipe in some time. Mike Mayock of the NFL Network lauded the Rams' selection of Gurley with the No. 10 overall pick, comparing the 6'1\", 221-pounder to Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks: I like the Marshawn Lynch comparison. St. Louis wants to win games the same way that Seattle and San Francisco do in the same division, that is by running the football and playing great defense and special teams. Gurley has Olympic-type speed. I love this pick for St. Louis, which already has a great defense and Gurley will help out Nick Foles. It would appear that fantasy owners agree. Last year, Bishop Sankey of the Tennessee Titans was chosen as the first rookie running back in fantasy drafts, with an average draft position at My Fantasy League of RB25. Gurley is coming off the board a full five slots higher, ahead of veterans like Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers and Joique Bell of the Detroit Lions. There's just one problem—one huge, glaring problem. Gurley tore his ACL last November while at Georgia. Yes, the recovery time for such an injury isn't what it used to be. And reports from Rams' camp have been almost universally positive. However, even if Gurley is ready to rock for Week 1, as Thomas Emerick of Sporting News points out, we're likely to see a lot of second-year pro Tre Mason, at least early in the season: Fisher's approach to managing Gurley's workload will set the ceiling for September and October, where we'll probably see a snap limit and heavy dose of Mason. Gurley owners will hope this step takes place in August. St. Louis also drafted four desperately needed offensive linemen, and this run offense will depend on a young line jelling together and finding starters by fire. With Mason in the fold, there's no reason for the Rams to rush Gurley. And yet he's being drafted like a Week 1 bell cow. Those who pull that trigger better hope it turns out better than Sankey in 2014. Average Draft Position: WR16 (41st overall) There may not be a more hyped player in all of fantasy football than New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Keith Lipscomb of ESPN was one of any number of pundits who have gushed about Cooks' potential as the new No. 1 receiver in the Big Easy: I think the Saints are going to turn up the volume in Cooks' game in his sophomore season. In his first five games, he averaged just 4.1 yards at the catch (how far downfield he caught the ball), but in his final five games before his injury, that number was 12.0. You know the Saints still want to throw the football but don't have their top-two pass-catchers from last season. Cooks is a dynamic talent, and this season he'll get every opportunity to show the masses, including more chances to make plays down the field. It isn't just fantasy types, either. Chris Wesseling of NFL.com also wrote that Cooks could be on the verge of a breakout in his second NFL season: Now that Jimmy Graham and Kenny Stills have been shipped off to Seattle and Miami, respectively, there could be as many as 175-200 targets up for grabs in the Saints' aerial attack. With only a declining Marques Colston ahead of him in the pecking order, Cooks is sure to be a featured player after dominating offseason practices. And it's possible that breakout could happen. Cooks showed himself to be dangerous in the open field last year before a broken thumb ended his season, and with both Stills and especially Graham gone, someone is going to have to pick up the slack. The problem is that with all the buzz surrounding Cooks, his ADP has been steadily climbing. A player with one season of 550 receiving yards is being taken as a high-end fantasy WR2. And for Lipscomb's colleague Field Yates, that cost is just too high: There's a lot to like about Brandin Cooks' game, as he's shifty, elusive and a menace to tackle in open space. But he plays a position -- slot receiver -- that isn't often conducive to finding the end zone frequently. He's slotted as our 16th wide receiver, but I simply think the lack of touchdowns will be an issue from a fantasy perspective. The issue isn't even Cooks per se. It's the hype that's sucked all the value from a player now being drafted far closer to his fantasy ceiling than the floor. Average Draft Position: TE6 (75th overall) OK, so \"hype\" may not exactly be the best word to describe the buzz surrounding Julius Thomas, especially in fantasy circles. In fact, he needs a hug. Evan Silva's comments about Thomas over at Yahoo Sports more-or-less sum up the fantasy community's feelings about Thomas moving to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency this year: Julius Thomas was easily the biggest fantasy \"loser\" of this year's free agency period, going from a Broncos offense that ranked first and second in the NFL in scoring in 2013 and 2014, to a Jags team that finished 32nd and 32nd in those seasons. While Thomas may prove a useful real-life pickup for Jacksonville, the bottom could fall out on his fantasy production. I told you he needed a hug. Although that $9 million a season the Jaguars forked over probably makes the 27-year-old feel a little bit better. If I need to explain to you why going from the fantasy penthouse that is Peyton Manning in Denver to the fantasy outhouse that is Jacksonville and Blake Bortles, then might I recommend fantasy bowling? I hear fantasy cricket is—whatever happens during a cricket jiminy or whatever it's called. And yet Thomas is still being selected sixth at the tight end spot on average. That's ahead of Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles, who could be set for a big uptick in targets this year. Ahead of Jordan Cameron of the Miami Dolphins, who has the added advantage of an honest-to-goodness NFL quarterback throwing him passes in Ryan Tannehill. And far ahead of veteran Owen Daniels, who replaced Thomas in Denver. Have these people seen Bortles and the Jaguars play? Average Draft Position: D/ST1 (68th overall) From an NFL perspective, there's no arguing that the Seattle Seahawks have one of the NFL's very best defenses. In 2014, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. The year before, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. Scoring defense? First in 2014. First in 2013. Two years ago, all was well. The Seahawks also ranked fourth in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. Not great, but nothing to cry about. Last year? Tears galore. The Seahawks free-fell to 23rd. The change was brought about by big plays—or more appropriately, the lack of them. The Seahawks dropped from eighth in the NFL in sacks two seasons ago to 20th in 2014. In 2013, the Seahawks ranked fourth in takeaways. Last year, that number plummeted to 21st. Yes, those numbers could rebound in 2015. Or not. It's not as if the Seahawks made big upgrades to the pass rush in the offseason, and turnovers are a fluky stat. Spending a sixth-round pick (in a 12-team fantasy football league) on any team defense isn't advisable. Spending one on a fantasy defense (that finished outside the top 20 a year ago) because it's a great NFL defense is even worse. It's falling for the hype.

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

What’s Happening: The Error on Dylann Roof's Background Check The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans. When the cyberbreach was first reported in June, only 4 million Americans, mostly government workers and contractors, were thought to be affected. The Confederate flag comes down in Columbia: One day after South Carolina lawmakers voted to remove the divisive symbol from state grounds, an honor guard removed it in a ceremony on Friday. A crowd cheered and chanted “U.S.A.” and “take it down” as the flag was lowered. The NCAA announced that the state is now eligible to host future tournaments.

(Gregorio Borgia / AP) Sophie Gilbert: “Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman is indisputably the most eagerly awaited work of fiction since Rowling wrapped up her Potter series in 2007, in no small part because it offers answers to the question of what happened to Scout, Lee’s sagacious and scrappy creation.” Megan Garber: “The other explanation for all the Fitbitterness may come down to the original software bug: human nature. We bore and burn out easily—particularly, it seems, when it comes to fitness.” Christopher Orr: “There’s plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted, and the minions themselves are consistently amusing...

Wisconsin currently requires employers in the manufacturing and retail sectors to give their employees at least _________ hours off each week. (See answer or scroll to the bottom.) 3 In 1948, Henry Wallace ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket, earning _______ percent of the national vote. (See answer or scroll to the bottom.) David Frum explains why Jeb Bush’s focus on growing the GDP won’t necessarily improve American living standards. The core idea of the emerging Jeb Bush economic policy is that a bigger Gross Domestic Product will translate into more opportunity and higher wages for the average person. Over the past generation, however, rising GDP has not always improved living standards. A close look at the period in the past 40 years when living standards did improve, in the second half of the 1990s, reveals that the improvement was driven by a (temporary) pause in healthcare cost inflation. When the cost of employee benefits rises more slowly, employee pay can rise more quickly. The tragedy of the American workplace is that employers continue to pay more for labor—but workers don’t receive that money. It is siphoned off by the healthcare industry.

Weekend Read. David Frum explains why Jeb Bush’s focus on growing the GDP won’t necessarily improve American living standards. The core idea of the emerging Jeb Bush economic policy is that a bigger Gross Domestic Product will translate into more opportunity and higher wages for the average person. Over the past generation, however, rising GDP has not always improved living standards. A close look at the period in the past 40 years when living standards did improve, in the second half of the 1990s, reveals that the improvement was driven by a (temporary) pause in healthcare cost inflation. When the cost of employee benefits rises more slowly, employee pay can rise more quickly. The tragedy of the American workplace is that employers continue to pay more for labor—but workers don’t receive that money. It is siphoned off by the healthcare industry. Verbs.

    "DiffbotBody": "No fairness in development process The city manager stated in his letter printed June 27 that “agree or disagree with the ultimate decision, the process must be objective and fair to all.” There is no fairness or objectivity in this process regarding development. By the time the city staff drafted findings supporting the seven variances from the legal zoning and recommended approval, the deck was already stacked against the community. And, in this case the planning staff twisted themselves in knots to justify this egregious proposed project. The staff found that no front or side set-backs are required because Brand Boulevard is so wide and the project sits on a corner. Staff writes that there is a generous 31 foot set-back at the rear of the structure but forget to mention it only applies to the second through fourth floors. Staff writes that there is a generous 54 foot set-back on the fifth floor but forget to mention that the proposal shows it is filled with two gazebos, a fire pit and two barbecue areas. There are no other buildings on the east side of Brand from Glenoaks to Mountain that exceed the current zoning yet this monstrosity will be 62 feet high; staff justifies the height because across Dryden on the east side there is a 70-foot-high church spire. According to staff no public open space, no set-backs, two extra stories, three extra units, 85% lot coverage instead of 50% legal lot coverage should be approved or the developer will suffer unnecessary hardship. Maybe if the developer did not want a 700-square-foot two-story recreation room, a 700-square-foot gym, a rooftop spa, tanning area, fire pit, two barbecue areas, two gazebos, an 1,100-square-foot lobby and 1,000-square-foot per floor open interior garden area encompassing four floors, his hardship would not be so insurmountable.",

Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "DiffbotBody": "We'd love to have a weekly date night, but who in the world is going to watch the kids? Yes, there will come a time when you will need a babysitter. It may seem hard to fathom (why would you ever leave your little angels?), but it's true. Perhaps it's a necessity like a doctor's appointment or the 2 p.m. matinee, but the fact remains — you need a babysitter. Read: How to spot a great babysitter Take a deep breath, and don't be terrified; there are ways to find your own personal Mary Poppins. Asking the right questions is key (as is knowing what some babysitters do when you're gone). Having this crucial intel can help you find someone who doesn't take advantage of the situation. In general, err on the side of caution; have a short phone interview or in-person conversation (with the kids there) to see how everyone gets along. It may seem old fashioned, but ask for references. Several online babysitting agencies make their applicants go through a background check; you could hire through one of these to know what your sitter's history is. Hiring someone who is CPR certified may also come in handy. Be sure to know if your sitter has a medical condition (like frequent seizures) that could possibly put your child in danger. It seems like a lot, but these are your kids we are talking about! If you are trusting someone with your children, you should know as much as you can about them in order to find a good fit for your family. Here are six things to keep an eye out for, but more importantly, how to find someone you'll feel completely comfortable leaving your kids with. 1. #Pooltime Social media can be a great asset for a babysitter (hello Pinterest), but it can also pull their attention away from watching your kids. How is your caretaker supposed to be taking care of your child if Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are more of a priority? Be candid about how your sitter uses social media. Ask to keep cell phones and other gadgets out of site while the kids are awake, and to not post photos of your children online without your permission. 2. Party at your place It can be unnerving enough having someone in your house to watch your kids, let alone their boyfriend, friends and siblings too. There's no way that your child will be first priority when your babysitter is focused on having a night in with friends. Don't be afraid to come off as controlling when you ask that no one is to come over while you are away. Your sitter may be wonderful, but there's no way of knowing that their friends are. Maybe asking a neighbor to keep an eye out for a potential party is a good option if you are feeling wary. 3. Extra toppings — on the house! Just because you've left some \"just in case\" cash on the counter doesn't give permission for a babysitting free for all; and having the parents gone doesn't mean rules go out the window. It's not unreasonable to ask a babysitter to put kids down at a regular bedtime, keep a schedule and have something other than ice cream and cake for dinner. Knowing exactly what amount of cash you've left behind and asking for receipts for purchased items can help avoid some financial mishaps. To make sure their night in goes as planned, leave a list out or a schedule to keep everyone on the same page. 4. \"But my dad says ... \" When parents are home, the little rug-rats know that they aren't the boss … but when a babysitter is over? Kids may think that things have changed. Even if your child knows that they aren't allowed to eat on the couch, does your sitter? It seems exhaustive, but making a list of house rules can help avoid some unnecessary drama when you come home. If your sitter knows what's to be expected, she can firmly answer \"No\" if kids try to bend the rules. 5. Tonight's season finale Yes, the kids may be sleeping, but it's still not a great time to catch the season finale of a not-so-PG TV show. It's hard to know who is watching from the top of the stairs, or learning a new \"vocabulary\" word or two while the season finale is streaming. As a parent, don't just toss out \"Use the TV and computer if you'd like\" offer, unless you mean it. Suggest that your sitter brings a book to read until you get home if you're not so sure what sort of thing your kids might be exposed to. 6. Negligence This can be kind of major (like forgetting to pick someone up from soccer practice) or a minor mishap (skipping important things like naps and snacks). Of course, negligence can be even more serious; signs of child abuse should be handled immediately … but hopefully these questions and getting a background check can prevent that from happening. Of course, you and your sitter should trust each other, but there may be times where your child can tell you more than your babysitter does. If your child seems to be excessively tired, hungry or generally unkempt when you return home, it's time to find a new sitter. If you do your research, you can avoid the worry that comes with having a babysitter over. Try having a little \"test run\" period, where you are only gone for 30 minutes or so, and then spend the rest of the afternoon talking with your sitter and playing with the kids. And don't forget to follow your gut; if you don't feel good about something, your motherly instinct is kicking in. But doing your research can help you find someone truly supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

    "DiffbotBody": "Grapes around the North Coast are slowly turning color as a precursor to this year’s harvest, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual and deliver a smaller crop than last year. Vineyard managers in Sonoma and Napa counties report that they have seen signs of veraison — the French term for the onset of the visual signs of ripening in grapes. During the process, which begins the countdown to harvest, red grapes turn from green to red and a purplish hue while white grapes go from green to a golden yellow. Local farmers said this year’s crop is maturing anywhere from 10 days to two weeks earlier than typical, similar to last year’s timeline, which resulted in the earliest harvest on the North Coast in a decade. Harvest is on track to start in mid-August, though fruit destined for sparkling wines will begin coming off the vines in late July or early August. In fact, growers feared harvest would occur even sooner this year following a mild winter that triggered an unusually early bud break, when the vineyards awaken from their winter slumber. Most vines finished bud break in February, more than a month earlier than normal. However, cool weather in May slowed down flowering and fruit set, when small flowers on the vines are fertilized and transformed into tiny grapes. Typically, this stage can last from 10 to 14 days. This year, it stretched out as long as four weeks in some cases, growers said. As a result, growers expect the size of the Sonoma County grape crop will decline for the second straight year from the record-breaking 2013 harvest. Last year, growers hauled in 255,635 tons of grapes, valued at $593 million. “We saw a long bloom because of a cool May,” said Ryan Decker, wine grower relations manager for Rodney Strong Vineyards in Healdsburg. “The main effect is you will see a reduced berry set, which is going to reduce yield a little bit, which is what we are seeing. … It’s just a little under the long-term average.” Barry Hoffner, owner of Silverwood Ranch in the Pine Mountain/Cloverdale Peak area that borders Sonoma and Mendocino counties, thinks his crop will be 15 to 20 percent smaller than last year on the 40 acres of mountain vineyards he owns and leases. “I don’t think it is going to affect the quality,” Hoffner said. Growers are monitoring their grapes to spot signs of unevenness among fruit that is ripening slower than other clusters because of the long flowering period, likely forcing them to thin some of the crop this year. “Our primary goal is uniformity,” said P.J. Alviso, director of estate viticulture at Duckhorn Wine Co., which has 600 acres on the North Coast from the Napa Valley to the Russian River Valley. In some cases, Decker noted, it may be worth picking some less-ripe fruit if it is on a vine that contains other clusters that are more advanced, as the flavors could balance each other out. Growers have been lucky this year with temperate weather so far, especially because there have not been many heat spikes this summer. As a result, growers have been able to reduce the amount of water they normally use to irrigate vineyards. The amount of water used by the wine industry has come under increasing scrutiny with California in its fourth year of drought. This week’s rains also will help. Hoffner said they would allow him to hold off watering some of his vines until August. At Rodney Strong, Decker said, workers are only using only 4-6 gallons of water per vine on a weekly basis as opposed to the average of 8-10 gallons. The company has about 1,150 acres. The wine company has adopted new technology to help it reduce its water consumption, using a device that measures “evapotranspiration,” which is essentially the amount of moisture released by the vines into the air. That device, combined with soil moisture monitors, allows Decker and his crew to keep tabs on how much water to apply. “It gives us (in) gallons of water how much each vine is using per week,” he said. “We have been tracking a little bit lower as far as water use because it has been a little bit cooler to this point.” Alviso agreed, noting that Duckhorn has been using roughly 4-8 gallons per vine. “I have been amazed how much moisture the vines had early in the season,” he said. “We have irrigated very minimally.” Both men said they anticipate the clusters of grapes will enjoy a longer “hang time” between veraison and harvest this year, giving the fruit greater depth and complexity. “Any time we can extend that window from veraison to harvest, the wine quality is always going to be better,” Decker said. Though the yield this year appears not to be as large as in 2014, which was part of three large consecutive harvests, it should be more near average, which will come as a relief for most vintners given the large supply of unsold wine on the bulk market. The Ciatti Co., a San Rafael wine broker, notes in its June update that the California bulk wine market remains sluggish, adding that “large volumes remain of both red and white varietals from the 2012 and 2013 vintages.” Steve Sangiacomo, a partner of Sangiacomo Family Vineyards, said it was “a little relief” to have a smaller yield, given there had been some anxiety among growers at the prospects of having a fourth consecutive large crop. “We want to find that happy medium,” he said.

Grapes around the North Coast are slowly turning color as a precursor to this year’s harvest, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual and deliver a smaller crop than last year. Vineyard managers in Sonoma and Napa counties report that they have seen signs of veraison — the French term for the onset of the visual signs of ripening in grapes. During the process, which begins the countdown to harvest, red grapes turn from green to red and a purplish hue while white grapes go from green to a golden yellow. Local farmers said this year’s crop is maturing anywhere from 10 days to two weeks earlier than typical, similar to last year’s timeline, which resulted in the earliest harvest on the North Coast in a decade. Harvest is on track to start in mid-August, though fruit destined for sparkling wines will begin coming off the vines in late July or early August. In fact, growers feared harvest would occur even sooner this year following a mild winter that triggered an unusually early bud break, when the vineyards awaken from their winter slumber. Most vines finished bud break in February, more than a month earlier than normal. However, cool weather in May slowed down flowering and fruit set, when small flowers on the vines are fertilized and transformed into tiny grapes. Typically, this stage can last from 10 to 14 days. This year, it stretched out as long as four weeks in some cases, growers said. As a result, growers expect the size of the Sonoma County grape crop will decline for the second straight year from the record-breaking 2013 harvest. Last year, growers hauled in 255,635 tons of grapes, valued at $593 million. “We saw a long bloom because of a cool May,” said Ryan Decker, wine grower relations manager for Rodney Strong Vineyards in Healdsburg. “The main effect is you will see a reduced berry set, which is going to reduce yield a little bit, which is what we are seeing. … It’s just a little under the long-term average.” Barry Hoffner, owner of Silverwood Ranch in the Pine Mountain/Cloverdale Peak area that borders Sonoma and Mendocino counties, thinks his crop will be 15 to 20 percent smaller than last year on the 40 acres of mountain vineyards he owns and leases. “I don’t think it is going to affect the quality,” Hoffner said. Growers are monitoring their grapes to spot signs of unevenness among fruit that is ripening slower than other clusters because of the long flowering period, likely forcing them to thin some of the crop this year. “Our primary goal is uniformity,” said P.J. Alviso, director of estate viticulture at Duckhorn Wine Co., which has 600 acres on the North Coast from the Napa Valley to the Russian River Valley. In some cases, Decker noted, it may be worth picking some less-ripe fruit if it is on a vine that contains other clusters that are more advanced, as the flavors could balance each other out. Growers have been lucky this year with temperate weather so far, especially because there have not been many heat spikes this summer. As a result, growers have been able to reduce the amount of water they normally use to irrigate vineyards.

    "DiffbotBody": "A different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. How exactly does one follow up , the surprise-hit, male-stripper melodrama that catered to a heated audience (mainly female, slightly male) but served them a cinematic buffet concocted by skilled storyteller Steven Soderbergh? Easy. You take the show on the road. To that extent, Magic Mike XXL is the most accurate depiction of male entertainers road-tripping from Tampa to Myrtle Beach for an annual convention that Hollywood has ever produced. If you only see one movie this summer about male strippers bonding over unfulfilled dreams while they titillate female clientele, make sure it’s this one. Why? Because it’s great. Magic Mike XXL often operates as the movie Entourage desperately wanted to be – or worse, actually thinks that it is. It’s 100% bro-powered, telling the low-stakes story of impossibly handsome dudes living their irregular lives, and inviting us along for the intimate ride. But the camaraderie and mutual respect – the Zen-like “chi” that’s preached and practiced by the men of Mike -- is as organic as unforced as Entourage was artificial. As a result, Magic Mike is believable, embraceable, and worthy of celebration. Where Richard Donner’s Superman once inspired us to believe that a man can fly, Magic Mike XXL convinces us beyond a shadow of a doubt that a dancer can leave the stage behind and open an ice cream truck that has a DJ booth attached -- entertaining the masses and satisfying their sweet tooth at the same time. Picking up shortly after Magic Mike concluded, the sequel finds Mike (Channing Tatum) struggling to get his carpentry business off the ground when a phone call summons him back to Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), the freewheeling choreographer and club owner, has jumped ship, leaving beautiful but dense dancers “Big Dick” Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan, (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tito (Adam Rodriguez) rudderless. Sensing that their stripper endeavors are drawing to a close, the guys agree to venture to South Carolina for one last blowout bash at an annual dancers’ convention. Along the way, Mike convinces them to ditch the routines that Dallas burned into their individual memories (“You are not a fireman, Richie”) and embrace new routines that come from the heart. And the crotch. But mainly from the heart. Magic Mike XXL pulls off a legitimate magic trick, recognizing the expectations of its suddenly sizable fanbase and somehow exceeding them. Magic Mike XXL isn’t surprising anyone this time out. The original film cost roughly $7 million, but went on to gross a massive $167 million, fuelled by female curiosity, the magnetism of Tatum (and his co-stars), and legitimately positive word of mouth that proclaimed Soderbergh crafted a moving soap-opera in a seedy, sweat-soaked Tampa strip club – the unlikeliest of cinematic communities. Audiences came to the theater with crumpled up singles, but left Magic Mike with soggy tissues, emotionally buying in to the ongoing struggles of these three-dimensional dancers. A sequel was inevitable, and with it comes change. Soderbergh opted to stay in his self-imposed “retirement,” handing the directing duties over to longtime collaborator Gregory Jacobs (though Soderbergh did contribute to XXL as a cinematographer and editor, explaining why this follow-up has the same sweaty, late-night shimmer of the first film). And now that he has an Oscar on his shelf, McConaughey chose to hang up Dallas’ leather chaps and opt out of the fun. No bother. His mystical aura is usurped by a larger-than-life Jada Pinkett Smith, who slinks across the screen and deliberately swipes every scene as Rome, an uber-confident and confidence-boosting Savannah strip club owner who welcomes Mike back into her world of empowerment. Like Dallas, Rome resembles a character we only think exists on screen in stories like Mike XXL, and I wondered numerous times during her unique scenes if this person, and her establishment, actually exist. Moving forward, however, I don’t need more Rome. Quite the contrary. I’d be thrilled if each Magic Mike sequel found a new character actor willing to fill the “role” of outsized Mike mentor, the way McConaughey and Pinkett Smith already have. Wait, subsequent Magic Mike movies? You better believe it. Magic Mike XXL is a different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining… by design. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and surprisingly unpredictable. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. XXL sheds the heaviest baggage of Soderbergh’s initial foray, keeping just enough drama to ensure tension, then filling in the gaps with unfiltered bro-heavy chemistry. It’s a winning formula, and one that proves that Mike’s world is one worth revisiting, just to spend time with these friends. We spend a lot of time talking about developing Cinematic Universes for characters who don tights and capes. What about the guys who slip out of their super suits to entertain? Don’t they deserve their own multi-film series? If and when Magic Mike XXL matches the box-office bar set by the original, it’s time we start having that conversation.",

Come September, however, those 56-year-old bricks will be gone and the exterior of the Aud will look a lot different. The bricks from the concourse roof on up are being removed, and in their place will be rectangular, champagne-colored Alucobond panels that will be aligned to match the curvature of the building. “Matter of fact, we even contacted the original architect of the building to see if he would approve of what we were putting up because we didn’t want to change the look of the building,” said Carl Annese, Upper Mohawk Valley Memorial Auditorium Authority chairman. “He said, ‘Well, I’d be more happy if you put the brick back up.’ But he understood why we couldn’t because of the cost.” Using almost $6 million in state grants, the arena’s renovation project has spanned several years and has included video boards, an Irish pub on the lower concourse, rehabilitated concession stands, a new locker room for the American Hockey League’s Utica Comets and a new parking lot on Whitesboro Street. And more work is planned. Authority officials are working to acquire the former Tartan Textile Services property just east of the auditorium through eminent domain, Annese said. While the property likely would house office and storage space, there is no timeline for a deal, he said. “It all depends on negotiations back and forth with the owner and with us,” Annese said. “You’ve heard of eminent domain going on for a few years or it could go on for a few months. It all depends on both parties involved.” Attempts to contact the property’s owners, Joel and Doug Grimaldi, were unsuccessful. There could, however, be the chance that the property housing the former industrial site is contaminated, said Brian Thomas, the city’s commissioner of urban and economic development, in an email. Since the property previously was a commercial/industrial site and might have some amount of contamination, it would be considered a brownfield site, Thomas said. “However, since I am not aware of any study that confirms the presence of environmental contamination, it is impossible for me to say what might need to be done to the building/site,” Thomas wrote. In the meantime, people will notice several permanent 8-foot steel reinforcement squares going up in certain parts inside and outside the arena to help brace the building, Annese said. The bars will be “basically on the upper level” of the Aud, Annese said, with the outside ones covered by the new material outside of the building and the inside ones hidden by banners in the arena. There also will be some painting and cosmetic work that will take place inside the arena, Annese said. The work was supposed to begin a bit earlier, but the Comets postseason trek into the Calder Cup finals put it on hold. “The Aud’s façade is being replaced to give it a more modern look,” Comets Director of Communications Mark Caswell Jr. said in a statement. “This has been in the plans since the beginning, but has been delayed due to the extended playoff run.” Follow @OD_Gerould on Twitter or call him at 792-4995.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With just one former winner in this year’s field, the 2015 Home Run Derby is likely to have a first-time champion. A few days before this year’s contest, the runner-up in the 2014 Derby is the favorite to win the title during MLB's All-Star break. Todd Frazier (7/2) has been given the best betting odds at Bovada.lv to win the competition, leading the rest of the contestants. The Cincinnati Reds third baseman was a longshot to win the title last year, but he made it all the way to the finals, falling to back-to-back champion Yoenis Cespedes. After hitting a career-high 29 home runs in 2014, Frazier has emerged as one of MLB’s top power hitters. His 25 home runs are the second-most of any player in the 2015 Derby, and he tails Giancarlo Stanton by just two home runs for the Major-League lead. Kris Bryant (5/1) is the second favorite, even though he has fewer home runs than any other contestant this season. He’s one of just two players in the field that doesn’t have at least 16 home runs and rank no worse than 21st in the Majors. The Chicago Cubs rookie has 12 dingers, though he didn’t start the season in the big leagues. He’s averaging a home run in nearly every 23 at-bats. The only contestant that’s won the competition before is Prince Fielder (11/2), having taken home the trophy in both 2009 and 2012. He’s having one of his worst home-run seasons of his career with just 13 long balls, but the designated hitter has been terrific for the Texas Rangers in 2015. His .345 batting average is second in the American League, and only Frazier and Bryant have better odds to win the Derby. Albert Pujols (6/1) is the AL leader with 26 home runs, topping every other contestant. He’s competed in the event three times, never winning and having his best finish 12 years ago when he came in second place behind Garrett Anderson. Chicago is the only team that has two representatives in the contest. Bryant has better odds than Anthony Rizzo (13/2), even though the first baseman has hit four more home runs than his teammate. Joc Pederson, Josh Donaldson and Manny Machado are all tied for having the worst odds (7/1) of anyone in Monday’s competition. Pederson has 20 home runs and he's a leading candidate, along with Bryant, to be named the National League Rookie of the Year. Donaldson has 21 home runs, and he’s in the conversation for AL MVP. Machado’s 19 home runs are already a career-high. Along with Frazier, Donaldson competed in last year’s Home Run Derby. He didn’t make it out of the first round, hitting just three long balls. Giancarlo Stanton, Mike Trout and Bryce Harper are among the notable names that won't be in the 2015 Derby.",

    "LabBody": "BLOOMINGTON — A requirement that Illinois sex offenders report all Internet sites they use to police is unconstitutional because it violates the offenders’ free speech rights, according to a ruling by a McLean County judge. Judge Robert Freitag agreed with arguments from the defense lawyer for Mark Minnis, 22, of Normal, that state law is overly broad in its mandate that all email addresses and sites a sex offender uses or plans to use, including Facebook, must be registered with police. Minnis was charged with failure to register the address of his residence after he missed his annual registration deadline by three days in August. As part of that requirement, he disclosed two email addresses, but did not list a Facebook and Ebay account he uses, according to court records. States’s Attorney Jason Chambers said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office plans to ask the Illinois Supreme Court to review the decision. The high court's ruling will impact all future Illinois cases on the First Amendment issue in sex offender cases. Defense lawyer Stephanie Wong said Thursday the Internet portion of the law “is not well-written and provides no guidance as to what the requirements are. The statute has to be more narrowly tailored.” According to Wong, no other court decisions have been issued on the free speech aspect of the state’s Sex Offender Registration Act. In Wong’s opinion, the opinion issued Tuesday by Freitag bars authorities from enforcing the Internet requirement at this point. In his order, Freitag cited a federal court decision challenging a similar mandate in Nebraska. The court there said ordering a sex offender to report all access to Internet sites “clearly chills offenders from engaging in expressive activity that is otherwise perfectly proper, and the statute is therefore insufficiently narrow.” Freitag noted that he is not bound to follow the federal opinion, but found the reasoning in the case “to be persuasive and sound.” Chambers said his office “takes sex offender cases very seriously.” The conditions imposed on sex offenders living in the community “are not meant as a penalty, but for the safety of those living around them,” he said. The rules related to Internet access are one of many requirements for Illinois sex offenders. Restrictions on where offenders can live, work and visit puts them at risk for criminal charges and incarceration if not strictly followed. Follow Edith Brady-Lunny on Twitter: @pg_blunny.",

    "DiffbotBody": "If you are at Chicago's Midway Airport or on board a Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) flight in the days ahead, don't be surprised if you see a lot of smiling Southwest flight attendants in your midst. Midway is Southwest's largest hub, and home base for many of the carrier's flight attendants. Late last week, the executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, who represent more than 13,500 Southwest flight attendants altogether, voted to approve a tentative new contract, which over the next several weeks will be presented to the full membership to ratify. A spokesman for Local 556 today said the vote on the new contract should be completed by the end of July. If, as expected, the contract is approved by the full union membership, Southwest flight attendants would, according to Local 556 President and lead negotiator Audrey Stone, \"continue to be the highest paid in the (airline) industry through 2019.\" The new contract also would be retroactive to 2013 when negotiations began. A spokesman for Local 556 said the contract does include pay raises for flight attendants, who in turn would agree to work rule revisions in exchange for the higher pay. Full details of the tentative new collective bargaining agreement will be released soon, the Local said. Southwest's tentative new contract with its flight attendants, however, still leaves the low-fare behemoth without new contracts with three major units in its workforce — pilots, mechanics and ramp agents who handle baggage and other crucial plane servicing functions at the gate. Southwest flight attendants were in negotiations for two years on their new contract. But ramp agents, who are growing increasingly restless, have been without a new contract for some four years. A large group of ramp agents recently picketed Southwest's annual meeting, and ramp agents who were unhappy about the excruciatingly slow progress of contract talks are believed to have been a key factor in the historic Southwest Airlines meltdown at Midway Airport in early 2014 that left 16 Southwest planes filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. The recent picketing and other rumblings about labor unrest at Southwest may have prompted Southwest CEO Gary Kelly to speed up efforts to get new contracts with all of the various unions who comprise his airline's workforce. Any major concerns about possible employee strikes could cause Southwest customers to consider booking flights with competitors instead.",

    "LabBody": "When the Tragically Hip recorded their landmark 1992 album, Fully Completely, the music industry was a different world. Back in the glory days of CD sales, recording budgets allowed worthy bands to fly to internationally renowned hotspots, stay for weeks at a time and work with a world-class producer. For the Hip, after making albums in Memphis and New Orleans, recording their third full-length in London with Chris Tsangarides had the makings of a “grand experience,” recalled Hip guitarist Rob Baker. Off to England went Baker and his bandmates: singer Gord Downie, guitarist Paul Langlois, bassist Gord Sinclair and drummer Johnny Fay. It turned out to be a “pretty horrible place,” Baker added with a chuckle. “There were some definite good things about it, but it was cold and rainy and we were in the studio twelve hours a day. We’d get out of the studio but there isn’t a lot to do late at night unless you really know where to go and have transport. So we’d go back to our little flat that we were all sharing and we’d play Scrabble and drink port and watch Olympic highlights.” Fortunately, they made a terrific album, at a time when the industry could support the extravagance of an out-of-country recording experience. That doesn’t happen much anymore. “The industry has changed so much that a band that gets lucky might get $30,000 to make their record, and for that, they give up publishing, some live income, revenue from merchandise. They give up a lot,” said Baker. “That was our art budget for Fully Completely. We spent $30,000 doing the cover.” In those days, he explained, major-label bands like the Hip would get a budget of about $150,000 to make a record. If it broke even, the budget went up a bit for the next one. By Fully Completely, Baker estimates the budget would have been more than $185,000. The numbers would grow for another decade. “Our album budgets were rising into the $300,000 level at the same time the bottom started to drop out of album sales,” Baker said, pinpointing the 2002 album In Violet Light as the moment the balance tipped. “You know, I’d like to think it had something to do with the business imploding rather than us getting really s***ty but it’s probably a combination.” Fans can debate that one, but everyone agrees they were the hottest band in the country in the early 1990s. When the five Kingston lads flew to London, they were road warriors, logging up to 200 shows per year. Tsangarides buffed their raw energy with a studio polish that sent the album to the top of the Canadian charts. There were no fewer than six singles: Locked in the Trunk of a Car, Fifty Mission Cap, Courage (For Hugh MacLennan), At the Hundredth Meridian, Looking for a Place to Happen and the title track. The band celebrated the release of Fully Completely with a deluxe edition of the album, and have spent most of 2015 revisiting the music on tour. It’s made for a surprisingly intense show, reports Baker.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Ultimately, Peoria School District 150 Superintendent Grenita Lathan saw the train coming, so she got off the tracks. Lathan resigned Tuesday, a move precipitated by two School Board members, Martha Ross and Lynne Costic, who had placed a measure on today’s meeting agenda to: “1. Consider issuing notice to terminate Superintendent’s contract ... 2. Consider placing Superintendent on administrative leave ... 3. Consider taking final action to hire Interim Superintendent.” It appeared they had the necessary four votes to make that happen, with new board members Dan Adler and Ernestine Jackson — they’ll be seated today — winning election last spring largely on their promises to push for change at the top. This turn of events falls short of surprising, though we had issues with the timing and process, all the same. First, campaign pledges or no, this was not the vote two rookies should have been making minutes after being sworn in. This also may not be the ideal moment to make a switch behind the wheel, with a budget that is hemorrhaging red ink and some very difficult decisions in an unpredictable environment needing to be made. Beyond that, apparently not all the board members were clued in that something this monumental was coming, a communication breakdown that does not bode well. These matters are never pleasant, but motivations have been questioned, as well. In any case, Lathan ultimately spared the board this vote and taxpayers some money, to her credit, as she is leaving under a negotiated settlement described as “gracious.” The details have not been released, but we trust that to mean less than the $100,000 plus compensation for 90 days notice that she stood to receive had the board terminated her contract — with a year remaining — without specific cause. We do hope Lathan is a better fit in her next job and next community than she seemed to be in District 150 and in Peoria, for her sake and for those in her charge. Early on she made it clear that there was a new sheriff in town who planned on laying down the law, accusing her predecessors of “decades of educational malpractice” and following that up with “I don’t believe people want District 150 to succeed.” alienating many locals whose support she’d have done better to curry. District 150 is now an island locally, with the bridges to the business community, to City Hall, to the park district, etc. pretty much washed out, though in fairness, it takes two to tango — or tangle, as the case may be. Public confidence in central Illinois’ largest school system has not been strong in decades but we’re in another valley. We’ve heard so much about Lathan’s tough, take-no-prisoners management style from so many sources that we believe there to be truth in it. We can’t remember when District 150 had a superintendent who wasn’t something of a lightning rod, but Lathan could set off sparks like few others, with her tenure embroiling District 150 in multiple controversies — the Charter Oak School testing drama topping that list — that, whatever your side, took on a very personal nature and sucked so much air out of the room that it detracted from the district’s mission. The turnover and transfer of building principals overall — much of it Lathan’s doing but not all — have been unprecedented and destabilizing in a district that needs all the stability it can get. We do not expect miracles from any single superintendent, especially given District 150’s demographics, longstanding challenges and two-fisted culture. Let’s face it, it’s a difficult place. There have been significant improvements to facilities. We hear of a more efficient central administration. Lathan cited her pride in the expanded International Baccalaureate program, the creation of the Woodruff Career and Technical Center, the teacher evaluation system implemented in collaboration with the union, etc. If she was demanding, she too faced demands — from state and federal governments, for instance — unknown to those who came before. She was brought here as a change agent, which inevitably ruffles feathers. Many may have gotten on board with her goals if her style hadn’t gotten in the way. No doubt there was another side to her — we hear as well of kindnesses to and defenses of individual students — but she didn’t allow many glimpses into that.

    "LabBody": "Ultimately, Peoria School District 150 Superintendent Grenita Lathan saw the train coming, so she got off the tracks. Lathan resigned Tuesday, a move precipitated by two School Board members, Martha Ross and Lynne Costic, who had placed a measure on today’s meeting agenda to: “1. Consider issuing notice to terminate Superintendent’s contract ... 2. Consider placing Superintendent on administrative leave ... 3. Consider taking final action to hire Interim Superintendent.” It appeared they had the necessary four votes to make that happen, with new board members Dan Adler and Ernestine Jackson — they’ll be seated today — winning election last spring largely on their promises to push for change at the top. This turn of events falls short of surprising, though we had issues with the timing and process, all the same. First, campaign pledges or no, this was not the vote two rookies should have been making minutes after being sworn in. This also may not be the ideal moment to make a switch behind the wheel, with a budget that is hemorrhaging red ink and some very difficult decisions in an unpredictable environment needing to be made. Beyond that, apparently not all the board members were clued in that something this monumental was coming, a communication breakdown that does not bode well. These matters are never pleasant, but motivations have been questioned, as well. In any case, Lathan ultimately spared the board this vote and taxpayers some money, to her credit, as she is leaving under a negotiated settlement described as “gracious.” The details have not been released, but we trust that to mean less than the $100,000 plus compensation for 90 days notice that she stood to receive had the board terminated her contract — with a year remaining — without specific cause. We do hope Lathan is a better fit in her next job and next community than she seemed to be in District 150 and in Peoria, for her sake and for those in her charge. Early on she made it clear that there was a new sheriff in town who planned on laying down the law, accusing her predecessors of “decades of educational malpractice” and following that up with “I don’t believe people want District 150 to succeed.” alienating many locals whose support she’d have done better to curry. District 150 is now an island locally, with the bridges to the business community, to City Hall, to the park district, etc. pretty much washed out, though in fairness, it takes two to tango — or tangle, as the case may be. Public confidence in central Illinois’ largest school system has not been strong in decades but we’re in another valley. We’ve heard so much about Lathan’s tough, take-no-prisoners management style from so many sources that we believe there to be truth in it.

The turnover and transfer of building principals overall — much of it Lathan’s doing but not all — have been unprecedented and destabilizing in a district that needs all the stability it can get. Page 2 of 2. - Were we to give Lathan the benefit of the doubt, we might have attributed some of that to inexperience and political immaturity from a relatively young, first-time superintendent. If there is a lesson here for the School Board, it may be that District 150 is not an entry-level job. Whatever, many locals may have been willing to overlook some things if District 150 was producing superior results otherwise. Although we hear of academic gains in the lower grades, the vast majority of schools do not make adequate yearly progress, and a handful produce exceedingly poor results relative to their peers statewide. Chronic truancy is up, high school graduation rates down. The budget is not in the worst shape ever but it’s in intensive care (though a lousy Legislature has a lot to do with that). We do not expect miracles from any single superintendent, especially given District 150’s demographics, longstanding challenges and two-fisted culture. Let’s face it, it’s a difficult place.

    "DiffbotBody": "It is a natural reaction for us to punish ourselves when we are suffering from heartache. Here's why that's a bad idea, and what to do instead. Emotional pain can be worse than physical pain. When we feel physical pain, we can do something about it; we clean the wound, put on some sterile dressing and give it some time to heal. Whether it is a muscle cramp, a broken bone or a laceration, there is a remedy that will facilitate the healing process. Heartache is different The pain of heartache stings to our very soul. Our hopes and dreams have been dashed to pieces. Like Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall, all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put him back together again. When our heart breaks, it feels as if we have lost a part of ourselves. Read: 10 ways you are ruining your own happiness Our first response is to blame, criticize or condemn. First, we turn against the person who is gone. When we realize that doesn't solve the problem, we turn on ourselves. We argue that we deserve it, for surely we are not good enough! We feel vulnerable and find ourselves susceptible to every look and comment. In order to mask the vulnerability, we adopt self-defeating behaviors. We sleep in, overeat, withhold positive self-talk and make ourselves do things that are difficult, scary or cruel. We think that if we inflict enough emotional pain on ourselves, either we will feel better or perhaps someone will come to our rescue. They will feel sorry for us, bind up our wounds and give us the love that we desperately need. Unfortunately, these types of relationships don't solve heartaches; they create more of them! Healing is possible \"One day while I was lying in bed, nursing my heartache and waiting for the world to end, I heard a knock above my head. I looked up, but there was nothing on the headboard that could have fallen to make the sound. I knew it was God. He was telling me, 'Get up! Stop moping around and do something!'\" Although time may assuage the pain, a heartache does not heal itself. The heart is the very center of the soul; it is the connecting link between the spirit and the body. The person we love becomes a part of us. When they leave, we feel a deep sense of loss, and the pain may seem unbearable. The only way to fill the hole left by a heartache is to turn to God. This requires that we become humble, willing, obedient and serve others. Humility The pain of heartache brings us to our knees. We realize our dependence upon God, and acknowledge that we cannot overcome this difficulty on our own. We need Him to help us. We give Him our burden of weakness and imperfection, and express our desire to be healed. Willingness We accept our imperfect state, and open our minds and hearts to God's healing power. We give all that we have to Him in exchange for His unconditional love. Our souls are bathed with the peace \"which passeth all understanding\" Philippians 4:7. Obedience We truly can feel whole and complete once again. The bitterness of the heartache will subside. We can show our gratitude to God by taking His hand and walking with Him, knowing that no matter what happens, He is there for us. Service As we serve others, our feelings of love for them will increase and we will desire to help those that are in pain. Finding ways to give helps fill the emptiness that our heartache left behind. We will feel a renewed sense of purpose, joy and happiness in life. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Heartaches are not the end of the world if we don't allow them to be. They are simply one more way for us to become closer to God. As we do so, we find that there are many others who walk similar paths, and that our experience can be used to help them.",

    "LabBody": "Season 2 of Extant premiered just last week with a few changes. At Comic-Con on Thursday, two of its stars -- Halle Berry and Jeffrey Dean Morgan -- and the executive producers sat down to gab about what fans can look forward to on the rebooted drama. Berry quickly recapped what happened to her character Molly in Season 1: She adopted a robot, went to space, and got impregnated by an alien. Then it turned out her alien son aged super fast. Then he died, and then the robot son got taken away, and then her husband got hit by a train. Then she got committed to, and subsequently escaped from, a mental hospital. This season has lots of fun stuff coming: It turns out her alien son isn't dead! But more importantly, Jeffrey Dean Morgan will be there. Morgan said his character, JD Richter, a cop investigating a series of mysterious deaths, and Molly \"meet at a crime scene and sparks fly.\" Berry said she was excited to have a man interested in her character. \"Finally, a man that wanted to kiss me! My husband last season didn't want to come near me,\" she said. Executive producer Craig Shapiro said they were excited to see the chemistry between Berry and Morgan, saying it \"fizzes\" on screen. \"Jeffrey and I do swap fluids,\" Berry teased. \"You gotta wait for it!\" Also something to look forward to: A kick-ass fight scene in the finale. Shapiro wouldn't say who Molly fights, but promised \"it's an amazing fight scene to wrap up the season.\" Berry also briefly touched on why she went from a successful movie career to television. \"I felt like, TV is the new frontier,\" Berry said. \"The best writing is on television. There are great characters for women and women like me, my age group, my ethnicity, and I felt like to go do some quality work, which I was finding hard to do in the film world, I would go to TV. ... Television is where it's at right now.\" Extant airs on Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS. Page 2 of 2. - (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)

    "DiffbotBody": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The gunman charged in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre should not have been allowed to purchase the weapon used in the attack, FBI Director James Comey said Friday as he outlined a series of \"heartbreaking\" missed opportunities and background check flaws that allowed the transaction to take place. \"We are all sick that this has happened,\" Comey told reporters at an unusual, hastily-scheduled meeting at FBI headquarters. \"We wish we could turn back time, because from this vantage point, everything seems obvious. But we cannot.\" He said he had ordered a review into what happened and that FBI officials would meet Friday with victims' relatives to explain the errors. The cascading set of problems began with the drug-related arrest of Dylann Roof in South Carolina weeks before the shooting, touching off miscommunication between local and federal officials and revealing potential shortcomings in the government's background check process. At issue was a police report from Roof's arrest in which authorities say he admitted to possessing illegal drugs. Under federal rules, that admission alone would have been enough to immediately disqualify him from an April gun purchase even though he wasn't convicted of the charge. But, Comey said, the FBI background check examiner who evaluated Roof's gun purchase order never saw the arrest report because the wrong arresting agency was listed on state criminal history records. Had the West Virginia-based examiner seen the police report, the purchase would have been denied, Comey said. The purchase order was on hold for three days as the FBI examiner tried to figure out if it should be approved or rejected. Once that window closed without a clear answer, the gun dealer used its legal discretion to complete the transaction. Comey said he learned about the problem on Thursday night and had directed an internal 30-day review into the situation and the FBI's background check process more generally. \"It may be a series of highly improbable events coming together, but this was a gun that was used to murder nine good people. So it's very important to me that we understand what we can learn from this,\" Comey said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, condemned the errors. \"It's disastrous that this bureaucratic mistake prevented existing laws from working and blocking an illegal gun sale,\" Grassley said. \"The facts undercut attempts to use the tragedy to enact unnecessary gun laws.\" Roof went to buy the .45-caliber handgun on April 11 from a licensed firearms dealer, Shooter's Choice, in West Columbia, South Carolina. The background check examiner assigned to Roof's case identified through South Carolina records an arrest weeks earlier on a drug charge. But the arresting agency that was listed, for reasons Comey said were unclear, was the Lexington County sheriff's office. The actual arresting agency was the Columbia police department. Had she reached that police force, she would have seen the arrest report in which Roof admitted having the drug Suboxone, which is used to treat opiate addiction, Comey said. The background examiner knew the arrest took place in Lexington County, but when she consulted her list of police agencies in the county, she did not see the Columbia police force. That department was listed in Richland County — where most of the city of Columbia is located. That list, or contact sheet, in retrospect should have identified both counties as home to the city of Columbia, Comey said. When she did not see Columbia on her list, she selected what she thought was the most reasonable alternative — West Columbia, where the gun shop was located — but the police department there also said it had no record of Roof's arrest. And the Lexington County prosecutor's office didn't respond to her request for more information. Before she could track down the police report, the three-day window lapsed and the transaction went through on April 16. Comey's announcement came within hours of the Confederate flag's removal from the South Carolina Statehouse. Families of the victims attended the ceremony. Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

An opening reception will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday, July 11, at the Museum. Admission to the reception is free and the public is invited. “Oral, visual and written communication has changed in unimaginable ways. The exhibit takes the visitor from cave drawings to the present,” said Joe Vidales, interim director. We communicate to tell a story and to document or share an event. The exhibit includes artifacts and period clothing from the Museum’s collection. Telephones from the early 1900s, the 1940s, and the 1950s, part of the Museum’s collection, are evidence of how our communication has changed. We do not use such phrases as: “This is a collect call.” “I want to make a person-to-person call.” “I’d like to place a long distance call.” Strange-looking typewriters from the 1930s, to the electric typewriters, to the desk-top computer are witness to the evolution of written communication. Besides talking face-to-face, we have used two tin cans and a string, transistor radios, a Walkman, and the modern iPod. The exhibit will include floor-model radios and radios dating from the 1930s and 1940s. Practically all of today’s photography is digital technology. Cameras of the past required that we buy film and then take the pictures. If we did not forget about the film in the camera, the film was then taken to a store for processing and to have copies made. The digital age allows for instant images and instant sharing through the various social media websites. The Weslaco Museum, located at 500 S. Texas Blvd., is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday. Regular admission is free to members, $4 for adults, $3 for seniors, $2 for veterans, $2 for students, ages 5 to 17, and free to children under five. The Weslaco Museum has free admission on the first Saturday of each month and for special programs. For more information, call the museum at (956) 968-9142.",

Federal and state authorities raided the home of Subway pitchman Jared Fogle on Tuesday, just two months after the then-executive director of Fogle's foundation was arrested on child pornography charges. Authorities wouldn't describe the nature of the investigation or what they hoped to find on electronics removed from Fogle's house. Fogle's attorney said his client, known by millions as \"The Subway Guy,\" was cooperating with investigators. Subway said in a statement that it believed the raid was \"related to a prior investigation\" of a former employee of the Jared Foundation, an organization founded by Fogle to raise awareness about childhood obesity. The company didn't say whether that employee was former foundation executive director Russell Taylor. Federal prosecutors in May filed a criminal complaint charging Taylor, 43, with seven counts of production of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. Investigators said they discovered a cache of sexually explicit photos and videos Taylor allegedly produced by secretly filming minor children at his home. Fogle issued a statement after the charges were filed saying he was shocked by the allegations and was severing all ties with Taylor. Fogle declined to comment as he left his home Tuesday, the hood of a blue rain jacket pulled over his head. Attorney Ron Elberger said in a statement that his client had not been arrested or charged. \"Jared has been cooperating, and continues to cooperate, with law enforcement in their investigation of unspecified charges, and looks forward to its conclusion,\" Elberger said. Subway removed references to Fogle from its website and issued another statement, saying the two had \"mutually agreed to suspend their relationship due to the current investigation.\" \"Jared continues to cooperate with authorities and he expects no actions to be forthcoming,\" the company said. \"Both Jared and Subway agree that this was the appropriate step to take.\" Fogle, 37, became the restaurant chain's pitchman after shedding 245 pounds more than 15 years ago, in part by regularly eating Subway sandwiches. Subway began featuring Fogle in commercials soon after, and his story was instrumental in giving the sandwich chain an image as a healthy place to eat. Neighbors said Fogle and his wife entertained frequently and would say hello but that they didn't see the couple outside a lot. Jacob Schrader, 19, who lives across from Fogle's house, said the pitchman seems \"like a pretty private guy\" and that he'd only seen him about a dozen times in the last five or six years. \"He's like an endangered species or something like that,\" Schrader said. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

    "DiffbotBody": "Type 2 diabetes may have consequences not only on the body, but on the brain as well. According to a new study, those with type 2 diabetes experienced negative changes in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, which was associated with lower scores on memory and cognition tests. \"Normal blood flow regulation allows the brain to redistribute blood to areas of the brain that have increased activity while performing certain tasks,\" said study author Dr. Vera Novak, of Harvard Medical School in Boston in a press release. \"People with type 2 diabetes have impaired blood flow regulation. Our results suggest that diabetes and high blood sugar impose a chronic negative effect on cognitive and decision-making skills.\" The study, published in Neurology, involved 40 people — 19 of which had type 2 diabetes and 21 that did not. The average age of participants was 66, and those with diabetes had been treated for an average of 13 years. The participants were tested at the beginning of the study and then two years later. In addition to the cognition tests, subjects underwent an MRI scan of the brain to observe blood flow and a blood test to measure control of blood sugar and inflammation. After two years, the participants with type 2 diabetes collectively had decreases in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, down by about 65 percent. They also scored 12 percent lower on memory and cognition tests than they had two years ago, while those without diabetes scored the same. \"Early detection and monitoring of blood flow regulation may be an important predictor of accelerated changes in cognitive and decision-making skills,\" Novak said. She also added that additional studies with larger sample sets and a more extended follow-up time would be needed to better understand the relationship between blood flow regulation and changes in memory and thinking skills. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95 percent of diabetes cases in adults, and several studies have shown that regular physical activity and a healthy diet can prevent or delay the onset. Past studies have identified links between the condition and problems with blood flow in the brain, but the effect it has on cognition is only now being investigated.

    "DiffbotBody": "Growing up in Turkey in the 1990s, the whole live music scene was dominated by cover bands that played hits from the United States and Europe. It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. But when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was. So I went back and listened to them—and was blown away. Listen to a playlist featuring Turkish artists covered in this story: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the music scene in Turkey flourished, producing local legends including Erkin Koray and Selda Bağcan. But a military coup in 1980 put a definite hold on the arts. There was not much happening besides pop music for a while, but a strong metal scene appeared in the ‘90s, including bands which formed the base for long running acts like Replikas, Nekropsi, and Daire 2: General Gramafon. The Internet then spurred on a new wave of vibrancy within the country's music scene, and underground musicians started to embrace their own roots and write their lyrics in Turkish. Peyote, a music venue located in the heart of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, became the first venue to exclusively book bands with original music, giving way to a healthy artistic community. Musicians in Turkey still face drawbacks on a daily basis: There are still only a handful of venues that host non-cover bands, with bigger venues only booking foreign acts (and not offering local groups support slots), and lots of music festivals have been cancelled due to new government regulations that prevent alcohol sponsorships. But these obstacles have brought bands together as they collectively work to book shows, open DIY venues, and do their own street festivals. Members of Istanbul’s music scene outside Roxy, one of the city's oldest venues for rock shows There are only a few cities in Turkey with music venues, and getting visas to play shows in Europe can be difficult, so touring is not really an option for most underground bands. But the economic inviability of making a living entirely from music—as well as the diminished chances of any type of rock stardom—has effectively eliminated certain types of musicians, leaving behind only the ones who are 100% dedicated to what they do. Right now, despite all the roadblocks in the way, there is an incredibly lively DIY music scene in Turkey, filled with talented musicians. I asked nearly 20 of these artists to take me where they feel at home in Istanbul and talked to them about the current state of the music scene. The journey led me through rehearsal spaces and tea gardens, alleyways and festive feasts.",

The majority judged the word “state” to be at best ambiguous. Chief Justice John Roberts held that the context of the word “state” mattered more than the “most natural reading.” This is the same Justice Roberts who interpreted a “penalty” as a tax to uphold Obamacare’s constitutionality in 2012, in spite of the fact that the lawyer arguing for Obamacare called it a penalty.",

    "LabBody": "Though we missed the ferry with a planned Morrissey interview in today's GO! (we were advised the enigmatic singer might, just might, be agreeable to a Q\u0026A via email), we'd still like to mark his ultra-rare Central Illinois appearance someway, somehow. At the very least, he has his own well-traveled avenue here in Bloomington ... more than most single-moniker Brit-born pop stars can claim, right? Speaking of more than most: as one source (the U.K.'s Independent) respectfully/famously observed, “most pop stars have to be dead before they reach the iconic status he has reached in his lifetime.” With that unique and enviable status in mind, we can't say we were surprised when the emailed Q\u0026A didn't happen, even after the “might” bait was dangled. Anyway, as far as we can determine, Saturday night's concert at the Bloomington Center for the Performing Arts (8:30 p.m., tickets still available) is Morrissey's first downstate performance since the man born Stephen Patrick Morrissey 56 years ago embarked on his solo career, circa 1988 ... a sobering 27 years ago. Of his other main career incarnation, with alt rock band the Smiths (1982-87), again we can locate no evidence of a prior Central Illinois visitation. The storied Brit-pop band was mainly the creation of Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, who were the band's contentiously creative Lennon and McCartney over a storied four-album run (\"The Smiths,\" \"Meat Is Murder,\" \"The Queen Is Dead,\" \"Strangeways, Here We Come\"). True confessions: Our first Smiths awareness came to us fairly late, courtesy busy Brat Pack guru John Hughes, the Chicago filmmaker who could always be counted on to lard his teen-friendly soundtracks with the best in cutting-edge '80s pop. Hughes clearly liked Morrissey and the Smiths, witness his usage of \"Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want\" twice in a year: in the \"museum scene\" of 1986's \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (Ferris \u0026 Co. at large in the Art Institute of Chicago) and as Jon Cryer's (Duckie's) theme song in \"Pretty in Pink\" (when he's listening to records in his bedroom and dreaming of Miss Pretty herself, Molly Ringwald). Shortly after our introduction to the Smiths, that era was over, just a year after the Hughes soundtracks gave them their highest-profile exposure stateside (despite the universal critical rep, the band was never a chart-buster here). Then came the solo Morrissey, whose persona since has always remained slightly out of focus for us, which is why we're happy to go with that catch-all descriptive for the artists we don't fully get ... enigmatic. When it comes to expressing the 50 shades of gray moods, though, we submit he has few equals ... a true poet of misery whose way around a tortured lyric knows few equals. He hasn't been christened \"The Pope of Mope\" for nothing. The Smiths, to be sure, were no strangers to the abyss, with such bitter pills as \"Girlfriend in a Coma,\" \"I Know It's Over\" and \"Unhappy Birthday\" — the latter infamous for dishing up the most dismissive greeting in pop music annals, riddled with threats of suicide, killing the pet dog and promises not to cry even if the birthday girl dropped dead tomorrow. The morbidity and dark moods followed Morrissey into his post-Smith years, though made more personal via his move to a solo forum, where he seemed to take everything further to a heart routinely pierced by life's slings and arrows. That stance can be summed up by our favorite bad-karma Morrissey musing, a little ode to despair called \"Satan Rejected My Soul,\" from the deep well of 1997's \"Maladjusted\" album. \"Satan rejected my soul, he knows my kind, he won't be dragged down. As low as he goes, he never quite goes this low.\" That's pretty deep down into the abyss, by any measure. On those terms, though, practically nobody does it better, and with a greater sense of fully knowing whereof he mopes. Craft is Pantagraph arts and entertainment editor.

    "DiffbotBody": "As of last year, parents can also return for adult swim lessons at Ives Pool, pool manager Ricardo Freitas said. Donors Chris and Virginia Anderegg have provided scholarships for adults who otherwise couldn’t afford the lessons, funding the classes for 11 of about 15 people so far this summer. The pool also provides swim lessons to every Sebastopol and Graton second-grader each spring through a collaboration with the Sebastopol Rotary Club. “It’s very sad to me to see a kid, 14 years old, and a man in his twenties die because they don’t know how to swim,” Freitas said. “It’s on my heart to teach the most people we can.” The efforts appear to be working: Just one person drowned in the Russian River each year from 2009 to 2011, compared to five in 2003, according to data from the Sonoma County Regional Parks department. But in 2012, the county saw another spike in river drownings. The people who died were either too old to participate in Vamos a Nadar or were from outside the county, Robinson said. Recognizing the need to reach people on the river who might be from out of town and without access to local swim lessons, county parks in 2013 created the Russian River Water Safety Patrol, where a park ranger and two open-water lifeguards are stationed at popular county beaches to educate the public about water safety. Robinson said many underestimate the river’s danger, unaware of how strong the current can be or that ankle-deep water can suddenly drop off into a 12-foot hole. Part of the safety patrol’s job is to educate people about those holes and how they change from year to year. And both the county parks department and the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake Sonoma have set their sights on getting life jackets into the hands of as many people as possible. Starting this month, Sonoma County Regional Parks brought on bilingual interns to distribute the vests at popular county beaches Thursday through Monday. Part of their challenge is finding new donors so they can buy enough life vests to meet demand, Robinson said. On July Fourth, they ran out by noon after passing out about 400. But it’s not a matter of simply providing life jackets: They must also overcome cultural resistance to wearing them. State law requires that any water-going vessel must be equipped with a life vest for each person on board; additionally those under 13 must be wearing a properly fitted life jacket, said Mike Dillabough, chief of operations and readiness for the Army Corps of Engineers San Francisco district. However, there are no laws requiring swimmers of any age to wear them, he said. “What we’ve found out is that across the nation, mothers are generally pretty good at this stuff, at wearing their own and getting their kids to wear (life jackets),” Dillabough said. “But teenage boys and men tend not to wear them.” He says the Army Corps has studied making life vests mandatory but found that doing so was not particularly effective. Instead they’re trying to get people to don them voluntarily. “That’s where you wonder how we can do better,” he said. “We’re trying to make the safety message more interesting.” Efforts include stationing “trees” of free life vests at every public access point on Lake Sonoma. On busy weekends like July 4, rangers come by frequently to restock and offer vests to those without them, he said. Bins where the vests can be returned are provided. Free life vests were also available at the private marina where 14-year-old Marquette Gross’s family was visiting, he said. The Army Corps of Engineers is developing a new advertising campaign that speaks to teenage boys and men and tries to make wearing a life jacket seem tough. Already, a sign near a stand of free vests at Yorty Creek Recreation Area shows Navy Seals crawling on a beach and says, “The toughest guys in the world wear life jackets!” At the Russian River, Robinson said concerted efforts to get children to wear life vests have begun to rub off on adults who see their kids having fun with them. “It’s kind of the theme of our beaches,” he said. “Peer pressure in a really positive way: ‘You wear a life jacket, I wear a life jacket.’” Staff Writer Jamie Hansen blogs about education at extracredit.blogs.pressdemocrat.com.

Those in charge of safety on local rivers and lakes have strengthened their plea for people to learn to swim or put on a life jacket before heading into the open water, after a teenage boy and a young man drowned in Sonoma County waterways on the Fourth of July. Marquette Gross, 14, died after falling off an inflatable water toy being towed across Lake Sonoma on the same day 20-year-old Jose Campos-Campos perished in the Russian River near Monte Rio Beach. Neither knew how to swim and neither was wearing a life jacket, officials have said. “If you can’t swim, wear a flotation device. It’s so simple,” said an exasperated-sounding Steve Baxman, chief of the Monte Rio Fire Department. He’s responded to numerous drownings on the Russian River over the years and helped save many others from the same fate. “I wish it wouldn’t happen. These people are too young to be dying.” As he and others were out scouring the river near Monte Rio Beach for Campos last Saturday, they assisted in the rescue of three other near-drowning victims, he said. And there are many other close calls each year that go unnoticed, said David Robinson of Sonoma County Regional Parks, which in 2013 created a river safety patrol whose three-person team also has prevented many drownings. Baxman, Robinson and officials with the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake Sonoma say much already is being done to prevent such tragedies, but that more work is needed, including expanding swim class offerings and overcoming a perception of life vests as uncool and unmanly so that more teenage boys and men will wear them. Baxman sits on the board of the Monte Rio Recreation and Park District, which oversees the beach where Campos accessed the water before he drowned. While signs there warn of river hazards, not everyone reads them, he said. Board members want to offer river swim lessons so people can learn the specific challenges of swimming in moving water. But they have struggled to find swim instructors, he said. “If we get instructors it will happen this summer,” he said. For now, some of the nearest swim lessons to the Russian River are provided at Ives Pool in Sebastopol. It’s one of the many locations around the county a bilingual swim program called Vamos a Nadar, or Let’s Go Swimming, is offered. Organized now by Sonoma County Regional Parks, Vamos a Nadar was developed more than a decade ago by a county water safety coalition created in response to a spike in drownings on the Russian River between 2001 and 2003. About 75 percent of the 21 who died in that short period were Latino, prompting the creation of lessons in both English and Spanish. Parents must accompany their children to the one-day program, which provides an introduction to water safety and swimming. Kids go home with a voucher for steeply discounted swim lessons.

    "LabBody": "SIOUX CITY | Dale Hebda and his employees at Hebda Produce were determined to have sweet corn ready by the Fourth of July weekend. To reach that goal, they first had to grow their corn in pots in a hothouse because corn doesn’t grow well in cooler spring weather, said Hebda. They would later transplant the stalks outside. “We changed its environment,” said Hebda, who owns the farm at 30661 444th Ave. in Mission Hill, South Dakota. The result was a harvest of early sweet corn in time for farmers markets in Sioux Falls and Vermillion during the Fourth of July weekend, as well as the Sioux City Farmers Market on Wednesday. But Hebda is ahead of schedule. Most farmers won’t be harvesting sweet corn for another 10 days or so, due to the slightly cooler than average spring, said Iowa State University field agronomist Joel DeJong. “I think (the time frame) is pretty close to normal. Maybe a shade later than normal, but it’s pretty close to what our time frame (for sweet corn) normally is,” DeJong said. The first harvest of sweet corn is undeniably close, though. DeJong said corn plants in many Iowa fields have sprouted tassels, the \"male\" flowers at the top of the plant that drop pollen on the threadlike \"female\" silk that cascades out of each husk. “That tells me in about 10 days or less we’ll probably have sweet corn that is ready to go,” said DeJong. “Typically the last half of July is when the most number of people have sweet corn ready to go.” Farmer Jerimiah Hinz, owner of Castle Creek Family Farms in Newcastle, Nebraska, had a stand at the Sioux City Farmers Market that was chock full of fresh produce. But no sweet corn. Hinz planted an early crop of sweet corn using traditional outdoor methods. The crop failed due to a cool May, he said. After replanting, Hinz estimates his current batch of sweet corn will be ready by August. Last year he had sweet corn by early July. “It’s a little later for me this year,” said Hinz. Siblings Alex Schmitz, 19, and Emma Schmitz, 16, of Schettler Gardens in Carroll, Iowa, said they’ll be ready to sell their corn by the July 18 farmers market. They usually grow about two acres of sweet corn each year. “My grandpa always told me every 10 miles south you get (sweet corn) one day earlier,” said Alex Schmitz. Meanwhile, Hebda said he's not sure if his operation will go the extra mile again next year to have sweet corn for the Fourth of July. Sales were slow this year, a typical problem on a holiday weekend. “People are moving around and they’re not thinking about making a purchase necessarily on (holidays),” Hebda said. Hebda Produce also had to sacrifice the traditional early crop of tomatoes and bell peppers this year for the hothouse sweet corn. It's a trade-off he needs to assess. “When you get to the end of the year, you’ll calculate what you had to give up to have (sweet corn),” said Hebda.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms don’t always stop with painful, swollen joints. Without proper treatment, the condition can cause serious, even life-threatening, problems affecting the heart, lungs and other vital organs. Read on for advice from top rheumatologists on preventing and treating the worst RA complications... Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can sometimes seem like a roster of problems: painful joints – check; another crooked finger – check; difficulty walking – check. Lung nodules – what? Crippling pain and gnarled hands are only Act One of RA, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects 2-½ times more women than men. The condition – and sometimes the drugs used to treat it – may lead to lung disease, skin problems and even cancer. “Because RA is a disease of the immune system, it’s not hard to imagine that [immune disorders], like infections, are affected [by it],” says Gary S. Firestein, M.D., a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Early, aggressive rheumatoid arthritis treatment, however, can often prevent or greatly reduce complications. “The difference between the first day I see a patient and after treatment begins is like day and night,” says Ozlem Pala, M.D., assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Rheumatology/Immunology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Read on for expert advice on 5 RA complications and their treatment from leading rheumatologists. RA complication #1: Cardiovascular disease About 40% of deaths in RA patients are the result of heart disease, according to a 2008 study at Emory University in Atlanta. RA patients face a two-fold risk for heart attacks and stroke. A stroke is the result of reduced blood supply to part of your brain, causing the death of brain cells. Patients face higher heart disease risk because RA inflammation triggers a condition called atherosclerosis, which hardens and narrows coronary arteries and makes them less flexible and unable to supply enough blood to the heart. Heart attacks and strokes are more common in patients with uncontrolled RA than in those who are on anti-inflammation treatments, Dr. Firestein notes. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Your doctor probably will prescribe oral or injected methotrexate, a medication to control inflammation and decrease pain, swelling and joint degeneration, Dr. Firestein says. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). This class of drug helps the immune system slow RA progression. Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine, biologic drugs such as etanercept and cyclosporine. If the patient has additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor physical fitness, the patient is treated for LDL (“bad”) cholesterol – most likely with statin drugs – and encouraged to lose weight, Dr. Pala says. RA complication #2: Infectious diseases RA patients also face a higher risk for common infectious diseases, such as colds and flu, and sometimes for severe conditions, such as tuberculosis and gangrene, which is dead tissue caused by blocked circulation or a bacterial infection, says rheumatologist Scott Vogelgesang, M.D., professor of internal medicine and director of Graduate Medical Education at University of Iowa in Iowa City.Because RA is an autoimmune disease, your immune system is busy attacking healthy cells in your body, leaving fewer reserves to battle an external threat like a virus. Also, some RA treatments – including methotrexate and biologic medications (genetically engineered proteins) – lower immune system response.Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Patients with a high risk of infection should get more frequent checkups and treatment follow-ups, take infection-reducing antibiotics when needed and consider changing RA medications if they’re causing problems, says Eric Matteson, M.D., chairman of the Mayo Clinic’s Division of Rheumatology and senior author of a 2012 study about predicting an RA patient’s risk of developing an infection.It’s even possible to stop medications, Dr. Vogelgesang says.“If patients are sick with an infection, I’m likely to hold off on RA medications temporarily,” he says. “If she has an urinary tract infection, for example, has a fever and is on antibiotics, it’s best if she’s off methotrexate until the fever is gone for one week.” That gives the infection medication a chance to work and prevents other infections that may occur from the DMARD. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Rheumatologists must carefully monitor patients with lung problems, taking chestX-rays and asking about coughs, shortness of breath and other symptoms, Dr. Pala says.“If their condition changes over time from the [original] tests, we repeat the X-ray and do further [tests] for lung disease,” she adds.Inflammation-reducing RA medications, such as methotrexate, are also used – even though they sometimes, but infrequently, cause lung problems, Dr. Vogelgesang says.Deciding whether to use a medication that could cause harmful side effects is complicated, he explains.Dr. Vogelgesang relies on patient-described symptoms, blood-test and X-ray results, the progression of joint destruction and a physical exam, among other tests.After assessing the results, “we weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and come up with the best sweet spot for the patient’s condition,” he says. “We also factor in their tolerance for risk.” RA complication #4: Lymphoma and other cancers The risk for lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph glands, is 2-5 times higher in RA patients than in people without the disease, Dr. Firestein says. The reason isn’t clear, but immune-suppressing drugs could be a factor. That’s because they prevent immune cells from finding and fighting abnormal cells, Dr. Firestein says. For example, biologic drugs may hinder the body’s ability to fight tumor growth. Early studies on RA medications showed an increase in lymphomas and other cancers, but large-scale studies have found that it’s not true, he explains. “If you’re being treated with anti-RA drugs, the benefit of having RA under control outweighs the risk of side effects,” he says. On the other hand, RA patients are less likely to develop colon cancer, probably because many take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin – which reduce the risk, Dr. Firestein says. Those drugs trigger diseased stem cells to self-destruct, according to a 2010 report by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: If his patients develop cancer, “I prefer to stop the arthritis medications if we can,” because medication-induced lymphoma sometimes disappears after ending therapy, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center in Baltimore. “If a patient has to go off one medication because of side effects … we can sometimes substitute [another] RA drug,” Dr. Vogelgesang says. Sometimes chemotherapy drugs, which also inhibit the immune system, will reduce RA symptoms, he adds.But if RA is difficult to control, Dr. Vogelgesang suggests that the rheumatologist, oncologist and patient discuss the situation, so all can decide which medications and treatments are best.RA complication #5: Skin disease or vasculitisRheumatoid nodules, or small, knobby bumps on the hands, fingers, knuckles or elbows, are the most common skin complaint; about 1 in 6 RA patients will get them, says Binh Ngo, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at USC’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.They also can appear internally, in the heart, the lining of the lung and other organs.Skin-nodule complications, such as infections, ulcerations or gangrene, are more likely in patients who don’t take their RA medications as directed, Dr. Ngo says.Another serious sign of uncontrolled RA is vasculitis, which causes the walls of blood vessels in the skin to become inflamed; it shows up in less than 5% of RA patients, she says.Watch for purple splotches of varying sizes on your legs, feet, buttocks and the back of your legs, says Ali Jabbari, M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. In small blood vessels, vasculitis looks like a bruise, but in medium-size vessels it resembles raised nodules and ulcers, or gangrene, on the fingers.Vasculitis also affects other organs, including nerves to the hands and feet, finger and toe arteries and the eyes, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). It causes rapid worsening of the lungs and inflammation of coronary arteries.Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Nodules often are treated with DMARDs such as methotrexate, glucocorticoids (steroids) injected into the joints to shrink them, or, as a last resort, surgery, to remove them, Dr. Ngo says.Mild cases of vasculitis are treated with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen, according to the NHLBI. They reduce inflammation but should not be used if you’re bleeding, because they thin the blood. Ask your doctor before taking NSAIDs.A severe case of vasculitis requires prescription inflammation-reducing medications, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.A patient with an aneurysm (abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel) due to vasculitis may require surgery to remove it, Dr. Ngo says.For more expert advice, visit Lifescript’s Rheumatoid Arthritis Health Center.

    "DiffbotBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway. Separately, P\u0026G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P\u0026G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P\u0026G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P\u0026G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter \u0026 Gamble shareholders could exchange P\u0026G shares for shares of Coty. P\u0026G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P\u0026G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P\u0026G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P\u0026G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P\u0026G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P\u0026G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. “This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,” Lafley said. “We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.” Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P\u0026G’s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal “is a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,” said Ali Dibadj, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. “The timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,” Dibadj told me. “Feels a little amateurish in terms of process by P\u0026G.” The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger, an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. “Sales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P\u0026G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,” Strebinger told me. The brands that P\u0026G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P\u0026G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P\u0026G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head \u0026 Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. “Procter \u0026 Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we’d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,” Erin Lash, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. “However, we don’t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.” The beauty category “has remained a challenge for P\u0026G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,” Lash wrote. “We suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.” The other brands included in P\u0026G’s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice \u0026 Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. acted as financial adviser on the transaction, and Cadwalader, Wickersham \u0026 Taft LLP acted as tax counsel. Jones Day acted as legal counsel, and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P\u0026G.",

Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With the majority of head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad back in pre-season training, preparations for Tottenham Hotspur's 2014-15 campaign are well underway. For supporters, glimpses of the team's sessions on social media are better than nothing after a month away. But the opportunity to actually see their team in action—players new and old working together for the first time—that is when things begin to feel real again. Over the following pages Bleacher Report looks at Tottenham's announced opponents for this summer's friendlies. We begin with the League One outfit hosting a Spurs XI side (likely consisting of development squad talent and any auxiliary players Pochettino needs to run the rule over), right up to the big-name opposition the first team will face just days prior to the Premier League season opener. Pre-season only tells us so much, but they are nonetheless fascinating steps toward the proper action beginning. Begin Slideshow » Tottenham's first opponents of the summer, Peterborough United, got their pre-season off to a winning start this past week with a 3-2 win over Dulwich Hamlet. On the scoresheet was striker Joe Gormley, signed in June after netting 40 goals for Northern Irish side Cliftonville last season. The 26-year-old's scoring exploits saw him mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by UEFA.com's Darren Fullerton in the spring. Now Peterborough manager Dave Robertson is hoping Gormley can help fire his team out of League One. \"I'm over the moon, he's a fantastic signing for us,\" Robertson told The Posh TV. \"We know that Joe is going to bring goals to the team next season.\" Ninth in England's third tier last season, Posh have also added former West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison to a squad that includes former Spurs goalkeeper Ben Alnwick. The new blood, coupled with last season's experience, has suitably raised expectations. \"Anything but promotion is failure in my eyes,\" defender Michael Smith admitted to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, per BBC Sport. With a game against West Ham already under their belts by then, Peterborough should be in shape to provide Spurs a decent examination of their burgeoning fitness levels. After 2014's three-match North American tour, Tottenham make a briefer visit to the States this year as they participate in the MLS All-Star Game. The eighth English club to be invited to take on the league's best since the old East vs. West All-Star format was abandoned, Spurs follow Bayern Munich who were defeated 2-1 in last year's match. Preferring to keep most of his team's preparations closer to home, the fixture is Pochettino's one pre-season concession to the now-routine activity of Premier League clubs heading overseas to further their global brand. Despite being a primarily commercial exercise, Spurs should find an exacting on-pitch challenge in the form of an MLS select group attempting to again demonstrate their ability against one of European football's famous old names. The still-to-be-confirmed team could well feature former Spurs striker Robbie Keane, in his fifth year with the division's reigning champions Los Angeles Galaxy. For several of Pochettino's team, it will be their first opportunity to get some important minutes in their legs ahead of the Premier League season. Those not making the trip to Colorado will be heading to Hertfordshire as Spurs open August away at . A frequent pre-season opponent over the years, Stevenage's Lamex Stadium also hosts the club's under-21 fixtures that don't take place at the training ground or White Hart Lane. This latest meeting carries extra intrigue in that it is one of the first games for recently installed Stevenage boss and Spurs Hall of Fame inductee Teddy Sheringham. \"The aim is to do better than last season,\" said Sheringham to his new club's official website following his appointment, while understanding that will be difficult given they reached the League Two play-off semi-final. The existing Spurs links at the club did not escape him either. \"I know a few of the boys, the likes of Chris Day were at Tottenham, I think Charlie Lee might have kicked me once or twice when he was coming through the ranks. I know Ronnie Henry too.\" Defender Mark Hughes, midfielder Steven Schumacher and centre-forward Brett Williams have all been drafted in to join those already there. Sheringham told the club's website he intends \"to bring in two or three more players at least\" but also stated \"I like what I have got now, the base of what we have looks really good.\" The Boro first team plays Wealdstone in its first friendly this weekend before visiting St Neots Town next week. Prior to taking on Tottenham in the final warm-up before the season begins, Sheringham's squad will take on another two of his old clubs, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, , have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him. Indeed, the Mirror's Liam Corless reports Real fans were chanting not-so-secret target David De Gea's name during the unveiling of the aforementioned signing from Porto. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid, Tottenham will have one more match in Munich the following day. They will face either or hosts Bayern in either the third/fourth play-off or final. Last season's 10th-place finish in Serie A has prompted change on and off the pitch at Milan. Pippo Inzaghi has been replaced with Sampdoria boss Sinisa Mihajlovic in the San Siro hot seat (almost as toasty as that found at the Bernabeu). Luiz Adriano and Carlos Bacca formerly of Shakhtar Donetsk and Sevilla, respectively, have been brought in to bolster the team's flagging attack. From within Italian borders they have drafted in Andrea Bertolacci and Luca Antonelli to try and improve things in midfield and defence. The Rossoneri would kill for the kind of season Bayern Munich had. Despite a dominant run to the Bundesliga title, the failure to win the Champions League has upped the pressure on Pep Guardiola. Bayern have been brilliant more often than not on his watch. Yet Guardiola's inability thus far to replicate the success enjoyed by the team in Jupp Heynckes' final season two years ago could count against him soon enough, no matter the difficulty of matching 2012-13's extraordinary treble. Should Spurs cross paths with Bayern in August, and depending on the circumstances, they could be witness to a fascinating atmosphere at the Allianz Arena. Iffy performances from the German side in their own tournament do not necessarily mean anything at such an early stage. But Guardiola and his team would prefer to launch their latest pursuit for glory and history in the most positive fashion possible.",

The Straw at Miracle Mile Deli When it comes to New York-style deli fare in the middle of the dessert, Miracle Mile Deli is about as good as you can do. For generations, this has been a family-run operation serving brisket of beef, corned beef, and matzoh ball soup. This year, the restaurant moved to a new freestanding location on 16th Street — and it serves beer and wine. It's truly a new age for this Valley landmark restaurant. You will experience a food coma if you eat this sandwich, so consider yourself warned. Which isn't to say you should let the prospect of sleeping away the afternoon deter you from ordering the Straw. This sandwich is piled high with pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut, not a particularly original combination, but satisfying nonetheless. You'll get your choice of breads, and the best option is to get your sandwich served on a hearty onion roll that will actually soak up all the juices from the meat and kraut.

    "DiffbotBody": "Today, it starts to get really real for the more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants that work for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV). Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue. In years 2016 and 2018, flight attendants would instead get a 3 percent annual bonus, that would subsequently be taxed at 40 percent. And some flight attendants are upset about the new way vacation benefits will be calculated under terms of the proposed contract — a complicated system that will create a more defined two-tier culture of full-time and part-time employees at the airline. The new contract also calls for longer duty day hours for flight attendants in some instances, rising from 10.5 hours to 12 hours — which was not what many flight attendants were hoping to see in a new contract. But even much smaller things in the proposed contract are being viewed as losses by some flight attendants. They include a new provision that requires flight attendants to report for duty 45 minutes before the schedule departure of flights on Southwest's new — and much larger — Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that seats approximately 30 more passengers than the Boeing 737-700 series model. Previously, flight attendants were required to be at the plane 30 minutes before departure. Southwest Airlines is expected to add many more 737-800 aircraft to its fleet starting next year. One truly veteran Southwest Airlines flight attendant who has clocked well over 30 years with the carrier had this to say today after reading through the new proposed contract: \"I have seen enough and compared to our previous contract language to know for certain this is a concessionary contract. Also, even though there is no defined contract language for retroactive pay, it has always been negotiated for our flight attendants going back to the date the contract expired (in 2013 in this instance). There is no retro pay, just a signing bonus (in the proposed contract). The bonus is taxed at 40 percent.\" Other flight attendants I heard from today point the finger directly at Southwest management, including CEO Gary Kelly, for all the angst the new proposed contract is generating among flight attendants as they prepare to vote on it. Noted one flight attendant: \"The negative publicity Gary Kelly is getting in the media is exactly what he wants to sweep under the rug. He thrives on feeling everyone is behind him 100 percent. I really think he has lost contact with the real world.\" A spokesman for Local 556 did not return a call seeking comment today or provide a copy of the tentative contract agreed to by Local 556's executive board and Southwest Airlines management.",

    "DiffbotBody": "While being single may seem difficult, we can find happiness in the dating process as we improve ourselves and our outlook on life. Last year, it was reported that single people in America now outnumber married people. There are many theories and ideas about why this is. One might think that it would be easier to find a soul mate because of online dating sites, but it seems that this has changed our millennial mindset, making us pickier than ever. Read: The most overlooked characteristic of who you want to marry The research group Euromonitor even predicts that by 2020, there will be 48 million new single residents, an uptick of over 20 percent of the current number. Notwithstanding, many of us still crave companionship, a void that nothing else in life can seem to fill. The dating game can be exhausting and frustrating, especially when we experience repeated breakups, which causes real, actual grief. Once this grief is properly addressed, which can include therapy, we still may be left asking ourselves, \"Why am I still single?\" My experience has shown me that usually it's not other people; it's me who needs to change. When I say this, I don't mean that we need to change who we are; rather, change what we're doing and why we're doing it. 1. Make it a matter of prayer Communing with God to better understand His plan for you can help you find peace in a brutal world. Consider that God's ways are higher than ours; He has a plan for each of us. God wants us to talk with Him. By putting Him at the forefront of our dating lives, asking Him questions, and turning to holy scripture for answers, we'll perhaps find some of the answers to why we haven't married yet. God does want us to marry, have families and learn to become like Him. Seek His guidance in what it will take to get to that point. 2. Meet as many people as possible Years ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a goal to go on dates with 50 girls. I remember exclaiming that was a lot. He then told me that he wanted to go out with as many people as possible to learn what he did and didn't like. He kept a journal of these dates, and started to notice a consistent theme in his preferences. My friend never made it to his goal of 50, because along the way, he met his wife. By the time she came along, it was apparent to my friend that this wonderful woman would make an excellent companion. He moved quickly and asked her to marry him. She accepted, and they have a wonderful life and a cute little boy. From this experience, it's apparent that putting ourselves out there will broaden our opportunities. If my friend hadn't been going places where he knew he could meet quality girls, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet and date his wife. Use every avenue possible to put yourself in front of people. As you are out there, remember that you may get rejected from time to time. That's OK. Take those experiences, learn from them, then move on to meeting more people. If you follow this pattern, you'll find rejection happens less and less. 3. Make a list of qualities you find attractive Also, make a list of things that aren't attractive to you. From these two lists, pick three things you absolutely must have, three things you absolutely can't stand and then discard the rest. No one is perfect, so simply focus on the values and attributes in a person that are most important to you. Finally, make a third list, but make it about you. What do you need to do to be deserving of this ideal mate? Only you can answer these questions, but seeking out the advice of family and close friends in this regard will help you narrow down your best and worst qualities. From this final list, make any necessary changes in your personal behavior, and hold yourself accountable to someone (such as a parent or best friend) to measure your progess. During this time, it's important that you keep dating, because this will give you realtime feedback about your improvements. 4. Be kind and stay positive Kindness goes a long way, especially in the dating realm. This isn't to say that you should go on a pity date with everyone who shows interest; rather, politely declining an invitation in a kind way will do a lot for your personal self worth, and it will make it easier to stay within your preferences. Read: 10 signs you’re in the right relationship Staying positive can be tough, especially if it's been a while since you've been in a relationship, but focus on the good things in your life. Keep your friends and family close; exercise; read; expand your hobbies and talents. Eventually, for most of us, the right person does come along. Until then, if you are the very best person you can be, you can find happiness in the single life.

    "DiffbotBody": "Who is the best player in the ? Not based on the last 10 years or one game, but over the last year: Who was the best? Good luck answering that one without starting a fight, right? Well, that's what the NFL 1000 aims to do by scouting, grading and then ranking the best players at each position before putting them in order and breaking ties to come up with the top 1,000 players. No narratives, no fantasy football points, no quarterback rating: This is cold, hard scouting. You can find rankings for all other positions on our B/R NFL 1000 main page. The B/R 1000 metric is based heavily on scouting each player and grading the key criteria for each position. The criteria are weighed according to importance for a possible best score of 100. Potential is not taken into consideration, nor are career accomplishments. Cornerbacks have many responsibilities—and those vary depending on the individual scheme. With that in mind, we graded them on run defense (10 points), coverage (75) and tackling (10), plus five points for their value as a starter or backup. In that category, we're looking at whether the player is a consistent starter, a spot starter, a top-level backup or simply a backup-only player. In the case of ties, our team asked, \"Which player would I rather have on my team?\" and set the rankings accordingly. Subjective? Yes. But ties are no fun. Each player was scouted by me and a team of experienced evaluators (Dan Bazal, Cian Fahey, Dan Hope, Marshal Miller, Justis Mosqueda) with these key criteria in mind. The following scouting reports and grades are the work of months of film study from our team. Players' heights, weights, seasons played and coverage stats from NFL.com unless otherwise noted. All other statistics from Pro Football Focus. Begin Slideshow » Coverage: 51/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 5/5 Greg Toler (6'0\", 190 lbs, 5 seasons) has big potential and has flashed top-tier talent at times, but he was far too inconsistent in 2014 as both a cover man and a tackler. On the ground, he saw 14 of his tackle attempts go for naught—a number that puts a huge damper on his run and tackle scores. In coverage, Toler played largely in man schemes while allowing nine touchdowns and letting 56 percent of attempts thrown his way go for a completion. Coverage: 53/75; Run Defense: 5/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 4/5 Coming off the best season of his career in 2013, Will Blackmon (6’0”, 204 lbs, 8 seasons) crashed back down to earth with a rough 2014 campaign. Working as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ slot cornerback for their first eight games, Blackmon was picked on in coverage and did not record a single pass deflection. After missing the second half of the season with a broken finger, Blackmon was released by the Jaguars this offseason. He was picked up by the Seattle Seahawks, where he is competing to be their slot cornerback, but the injury-prone 30-year-old is truly best suited for playing on special teams. Coverage: 56/75; Run Defense: 2/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 Melvin White (6’1”, 215 lbs, 2 seasons) began the 2014 season as a starter for the Carolina Panthers but lost playing time over the course of the year due to poor performance. A big but slow cornerback, White makes some plays on the ball with his length but does not play with enough physicality or fluidity to make up for his athletic shortcomings. He is inconsistent both in coverage and as a tackler and does not make the impact a cornerback of his size should in run defense. Coverage: 52/75; Run Defense: 6/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 At one point, Robert McClain (5’9”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) looked set to be one of the better slot cornerbacks in the NFL. However, his performances since that point have dropped off significantly. McClain struggles with his footwork, something that is a major issue for cornerbacks who play inside, and he can’t make up for that with length or ball skills. While he is a good run defender in terms of reacting to plays and aggressively forcing his way to ball-carriers, he must become a better tackler to truly show value there. Coverage: 55/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 5/10; Starter: 3/5 Chris Owens (5’9”, 180 lbs, 6 seasons) is one of many players across the NFL who is immediately thought of as a good slot cornerback simply because of his size. It’s true that Owens had proved to be adequate in the past, but his skill set doesn’t allow him to handle the two-way game that comes with playing inside. Owens doesn’t have the foot speed or balance to consistently contain the faster inside receivers in the NFL, which showed during the 2014 season. Coverage: 57/75; Run Defense: 4/10; Tackling: 2/10; Starter: 3/5 While Cassius Vaughn (5’11”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) has good long speed, he is slow coming out of his stance and flipping his hips, which enables receivers to beat him off the line frequently. He does not play physically and is a poor tackler. After one unimpressive season with the Detroit Lions, Vaughn signed this offseason with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he will have to fight just to make the 53-man roster.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. \"Brown Sugar\" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, \"all the nasty subjects in one go\"). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R\u0026B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of \"Wild Horses\" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of \"Dead Flowers\" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (\"You Gotta Move\") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R\u0026B of \"I Got the Blues\" to the crunchy boogie of \"Bitch\" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on \"Dead Flowers\" is obviously played for laughs, but \"You Gotta Move\" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. \"I Got the Blues\" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. \"Sister Morphine\" and \"Moonlight Mile\" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of \"Brown Sugar\" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on \"Miami Vice\" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The signature bottle of Ran-Lew Dairy Milk Co. can be seen in local groceries and restaurants across Alamance County. Customers may notice the cows grazing on the label, the allure of “Cream Top Whole Milk” or the appeal of the farm’s nearby address in Snow Camp. What customers may not realize is that the entire Ran-Lew Dairy Milk package — from the milking of the cows to the bottling of the product — is done entirely on that Snow Camp farm without a single middleman. “We’re essentially the closest thing to raw milk you can get,” Ran-Lew Dairy owner Randy Lewis said. “We basically get the milk out of the cow, pasteurize it, put it in a bottle and then give it to you.” Because of the non-standardized process, the Ran-Lew products of whole, low-fat and chocolate milk sold at Company Shop Markets, Lowes Foods and other spots depend heavily on Lewis’ cows. “For most companies, whole milk is usually 3.25 percent butterfat,” he said. “But here it’s different as long as the milk meets the minimum percentage. If the cows are producing four percent butterfat, that’s what you get.” Lewis had comfortable success running the farm until 2009, when the struggling economy did a number on the family business. Costs to maintain the farm had increased and milk wasn’t selling. Lewis ultimately decided that bottling the milk on the farm, instead of needing to sacrifice a percentage of the profit to bottling companies, would keep the business afloat. He and his family run the bottling operation inside a refrigerated tractor-trailer, keeping the crates of milk bottles cold and profits high. The self-bottling operation differentiates Ran-Lew from nearby competition, such as Homeland Creamery in Julian, and Maple View Farm in Hillsborough. “They have their markets sewed up, so I felt that we had to do something to be different or else this wouldn’t work,” Lewis said. “So we take a natural approach by not homogenizing the milk. We don’t even own a cream separator.” Since the milk is non-homogenized, the cream rises to the top when sitting. This cream carries nutrients like Vitamin A and D, and is easier to digest, according to the Ran-Lew website. Although local farms compete in the same or similar markets, Lewis said they are all fighting the same large-scale battle — keeping their businesses alive in an age of big brand dairy products that dominate shelf space. “We basically help producers like Randy overcome the barriers of distribution,” Growing Together Program Manager John Law said. “We open the doors and get them in places like Lowes Foods so they can start selling.” Law said he was drawn to the Lewis operation because of the strength of the milk itself and the uniqueness of Lewis bottling his own product. “The milk is as close as you can get to legally buying it straight out of the cow,” he said. “And this is really the only farm nearby that bottles its own milk.” But without a marketing team or funds to advertise, Law said it’s difficult to raise awareness of Ran-Lew milk. Word of mouth is still the most effective tool — it’s also the only one for the declining number of small business farms. “There are very few farms like Randy’s anymore,” Law said. “People around here getting milk from local farms used to be the rule, but now it’s the exception.” The growing appeal of foods not from genetically modified organisms may help. According to Lewis, Ran-Lew milk products will be essentially GMO-free by October. “When that happens, it will put us in a unique position,” he said. “If GMOs are the reason you’re buying organic foods, then we should be able to supply that market. It’s just a wider niche for us.” That cream isn’t cheap, either. Large dairy companies often separate the cream from the milk and use it for their ice cream and butter products, minimizing the cost and keeping profits high. But removing the cream would be removing the essence of Lewis’ product. “One reason we charge more than some companies do is that we leave the cream still in it,” Lewis said. “We can’t get rid of it. We have to have it in the milk because that’s all we sell and that sets us apart.” Then there is The Last Barn Dance, a short documentary directed by Jason Arthurs and Ted Richardson about Lewis keeping the Alamance County barn dancing tradition alive. It received Honorable Mention at the American Documentary Film Festival and was voted Best Short Documentary at the Kansas City Filmfest. “The movie is a third about the dancing, a third about my milk bottling plant and a third about my life as a small independent farmer,” Lewis said. Lewis isn’t planning on jumping to the movie industry any time soon. Instead, he’ll continue making his livelihood on the land his family has owned for more than a century, adapting his straight-from-the-farm milk operation to an era rarely kind to small business farmers. “We can’t make it in the corporate world since the economy has left us behind,” he said. “So you either have to make it here or quit.”",
    "LabBody": "The signature bottle of Ran-Lew Dairy Milk Co. can be seen in local groceries and restaurants across Alamance County. Customers may notice the cows grazing on the label, the allure of “Cream Top Whole Milk” or the appeal of the farm’s nearby address in Snow Camp. What customers may not realize is that the entire Ran-Lew Dairy Milk package — from the milking of the cows to the bottling of the product — is done entirely on that Snow Camp farm without a single middleman. “We’re essentially the closest thing to raw milk you can get,” Ran-Lew Dairy owner Randy Lewis said. “We basically get the milk out of the cow, pasteurize it, put it in a bottle and then give it to you.” Because of the non-standardized process, the Ran-Lew products of whole, low-fat and chocolate milk sold at Company Shop Markets, Lowes Foods and other spots depend heavily on Lewis’ cows. “For most companies, whole milk is usually 3.25 percent butterfat,” he said. “But here it’s different as long as the milk meets the minimum percentage. If the cows are producing four percent butterfat, that’s what you get.” THE ORIGINS. of Ran-Lew’s somewhere-around-4-percent-sometimes milk operation can be traced all the way back to the 19th century. There is no record for when the land was officially transferred over to the Lewis family, but it has been a part of its history for five generations. Lewis had comfortable success running the farm until 2009, when the struggling economy did a number on the family business. Costs to maintain the farm had increased and milk wasn’t selling. Lewis ultimately decided that bottling the milk on the farm, instead of needing to sacrifice a percentage of the profit to bottling companies, would keep the business afloat. He and his family run the bottling operation inside a refrigerated tractor-trailer, keeping the crates of milk bottles cold and profits high.

Although local farms compete in the same or similar markets, Lewis said they are all fighting the same large-scale battle — keeping their businesses alive in an age of big brand dairy products that dominate shelf space. Page 2 of 3. - “Unless if you’re in a very specific niche market, you’re going to be fighting big businesses,” he said of the challenges faced by small business owners. “We’re all just trying to survive.” LEWIS’ FIGHT. to compete in a market swarmed with well-known companies is aided by North Carolina Growing Together, an initiative through the N.C. State Center for Environmental Farming Systems. “We basically help producers like Randy overcome the barriers of distribution,” Growing Together Program Manager John Law said. “We open the doors and get them in places like Lowes Foods so they can start selling.” Law said he was drawn to the Lewis operation because of the strength of the milk itself and the uniqueness of Lewis bottling his own product. “The milk is as close as you can get to legally buying it straight out of the cow,” he said. “And this is really the only farm nearby that bottles its own milk.” But without a marketing team or funds to advertise, Law said it’s difficult to raise awareness of Ran-Lew milk.

It’s just a wider niche for us.” STANDING OUT. too much from large-scale dairy brands has its disadvantages. One customer at a restaurant to which Ran-Lew distributes said his milk had gone bad because there were chunks in it — which were just bits of cream and milk fat that are safe to consume. That cream isn’t cheap, either. Large dairy companies often separate the cream from the milk and use it for their ice cream and butter products, minimizing the cost and keeping profits high. But removing the cream would be removing the essence of Lewis’ product. “One reason we charge more than some companies do is that we leave the cream still in it,” Lewis said. “We can’t get rid of it. We have to have it in the milk because that’s all we sell and that sets us apart.” Page 3 of 3. - Lewis himself can be set apart from the average dairy farmer. At the Snow Camp Independence Day Parade, he wore an American flag-themed top hat that was dwarfed by his thick red beard. He posed for Facebook photos next to a calf of his called “Unkie,” holding up a sign that read “Unkie wants you to drink Ran-Lew milk.” Then there is The Last Barn Dance, a short documentary directed by Jason Arthurs and Ted Richardson about Lewis keeping the Alamance County barn dancing tradition alive.

    "LabBody": "RACINE — In the 1,709 days since a pregnant Caledonia woman overdosed on heroin and died, she missed her younger sister’s graduation and wedding, and the birth of her now 3-year-old son. Her death — coming after a syringe full of heroin was administered by her ex-boyfriend — destroyed their family, said Kattie Vlasak, whose older sister, Sarah Blask, was found dead on Nov. 3, 2010, in her ex-boyfriend’s Racine apartment. “The world lost a little bit of light that day and became darker,” Vlasak said Thursday during that man’s sentencing. “At 21 years old I was forced to plan my sister’s funeral.” Eric P. Gallup, 37, was sentenced to 22 ½ years in prison plus another 7 ½ years on extended supervision in connection with Blask’s death. He was accused more than four years ago of giving Blask, 26, the heroin on which she reportedly overdosed. She was two months pregnant by another man, who was her boyfriend at the time. Gallup was charged the next day with first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree reckless homicide of an unborn child, maintaining a drug-trafficking place and five other drug-related charges, according to court records. He pleaded guilty on May 1 to a downgraded charge of second-degree reckless homicide, and to delivery of heroin. Gallup received the maximum sentence on the homicide charge. Racine County Assistant District Attorney Robert Repischak asked for a prison sentence for Gallup, but per the plea deal, didn’t recommend a specific amount of time to be served. Gallup’s defense attorney, Richard Hart, called for 10 to 12 years behind bars “plus extensive supervision.” While Blask’s death has been hardest on her family, Hart said it has been difficult on Gallup’s family, as well. “Right now his daughter won’t even talk to him. That’s on him,” Hart said. ‘A prison of their own’ Police found Blask on the floor at Gallup’s apartment, covered with a blanket, after they were called to the unit because Blask was unresponsive, according to Gallup’s criminal complaint. There were injuries to her face and blood near the spot where she lay. During his sentencing, Gallup apologized, but said Blask’s family received the wrong account of what happened before she died. However, he did not provide an alternate account, or detail which allegations were incorrect. “I’m guilty. Sarah may have been killed by her addiction, but it was my addiction” that led the pair to use heroin the night before Blask’s death, Gallup said. “I am responsible for feeding my addiction and the choices I have made, and for Sarah’s death. There is no undoing the damage I’ve done.” Circuit Court Judge Michael Piontek acknowledged that no sentence he could impose would bring “peace and serenity” to the families, noting “the victim’s family’s been in a prison of their own.” During the sentencing, her sister said Blask had been clean and sober and was attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. But then she went to Gallup’s apartment to retrieve some personal belongings. Hart disputed that Blask was “clean and sober,” saying she had multiple track marks on her body from drug use, which were “in different stages.” “To be sure, she had her own demons she was dealing with. But she was at a point in her life (where) she was moving toward sobriety,” Repischak said. ‘I hope he rots’ Jail records show Gallup has been in the Racine County Jail since Blask’s death. Piontek granted him credit for the more than 4 ½ years already spent behind bars. After the sentencing, Hart said “it’s very unlikely” Gallup will appeal. “We anticipated (the sentence) was going to be very close to that, so I am not surprised,” he said. Vlasak, 26, now of Charlotte, North Carolina, said she felt grateful that Piontek “expedited this and he really cared about the victims,” but as for Gallup, “I hope he rots.” “It’s hard to describe how you feel when someone’s being sentenced for something so horrible. Obviously I think he deserves to be thrown away for life,” she said sitting on a bench outside the courtroom. “I hope we can move forward in our lives and find some happiness.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "This past holiday weekend, American pop star Ariana Grande was filmed licking some donuts in a California bakery and then casually expressing her hatred for America. Grande has since apologized for the comments, but failed to acknowledge the donut-licking incident. While her actions were undeniably gross, we can’t help but wonder if licking someone else’s food is actually a public health concern. Saliva gets a bad rap for being gross, and rightfully so; it’s literally filled with bacteria and viruses. “The mouth is a perfect environment for growing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It’s warm and dark, food goes in there several times a day, and there are lots of little nooks and crannies where food can get caught,” said dentist and oral microbiologist Donna Mager, of the Forsyth Institute, a nonprofit group that focuses on oral and craniofacial research, as reported by Discover Magazine. Some of the most common diseases which can spread through saliva are strep throat, the common cold, mumps, meningitis, herpes, mononucleosis, and more rare conditions such as foot-and-mouth disease, The Huffington Post reported. With that being said, just because saliva is filled with germs does not necessarily mean it’s particularly dangerous. Ever wonder why animals instinctively lick their wounds? It could be that Fido is onto something that we’ve overlooked. Along with germs and pathogens, saliva is also filled with unique antibodies and antimicrobial compounds that help to disable these germs and viruses. Even HIV can be destroyed by oral antibodies, which is why it’s nearly impossible to pass on the virus through saliva. Most of the bacteria in the mouth are anaerobic, meaning they cannot survive long in the presence of oxygen, or in the case of obligate anaerobes, cannot survive at all once they hit air. Some common examples of anaerobic bacteria include E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and C. botulinum. While each of these bacteria have different lifespans once they leave a body, one thing is for sure: Once they hit the air, the clock starts ticking. This means that, depending on the amount of time between Grande’s infamous donut licks and when that donut was eaten by an unsuspecting customer, the large majority of bacteria could have quite possibly died off quite soon after the moisture from her saliva dried up. Now while bacteria may be sensitive to the outside world, viruses, on the other hand, are quite resilient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B can survive outside the body for at least seven days and still be capable of causing infection. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service reports that cold viruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for more than a week. Flu viruses have a shorter outside lifespan of only around a day, and stomach bugs, such as the norovirus, can last for weeks. With that being said, however, the effectiveness of the virus starts to decrease after about 24 hours of being outside of a host, so not too much cause for concern. Regardless of the public health risk licking donuts may be, health authorities aren’t taking any chances. The bakery, Wolfee Donuts in California has reportedly received a docked health grade a day after the incidence was released to the public, and according to Perez Hilton, the Riverside Department of Environmental Health is currently investigating the incident and reviewing whether or not it is in violation of health codes. Considering that everything from diarrhea-inducing listeria to glass was found in food this year, a pint-sized pop star’s saliva is probably the very least of our concerns.",

    "DiffbotBody": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — An impassioned plea by a descendant of the Confederate president seemed to swing momentum as South Carolina legislators debated whether to remove the rebel battle flag from the Statehouse grounds. Republicans offered dozens of amendments during the 14-hour debate, and even one would have delayed the flag's removal. Many spoke of Southern heritage and cited family connections to Confederate soldiers. Rep. Jenny Horne, a 42-year-old white Republican lawyer, then took the microphone to scold her colleagues. \"I have heard enough about heritage,\" Horne said, her tearful voice rising to a shout. \"I am a descendant of Jefferson Davis, OK? But that does not matter. It's not about Jenny Horne. It's about the people of South Carolina who have demanded that this symbol of hate come off of the Statehouse grounds.\" The debate seemed to turn after that. By early Thursday, representatives approved the same bill that already passed the Senate, enabling Gov. Nikki Haley's office to announce that the flag would come down on Friday. Horne, whose district includes the overwhelmingly white Charleston suburb of Summerville, cried as she remembered the funeral of Sen. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed along with eight other African-American worshippers during their Bible study in a Charleston church last month. \"I cannot believe that we do not have the heart in this body to do something meaningful such as take a symbol of hate off these grounds on Friday!\" she shouted. \"For the widow of Sen. Pinckney and his two young daughters, that would be adding insult to injury and I will not be a part of it!\" It took several more hours after Horne's plea, but the chamber met her deadline, voting overwhelmingly to remove the flag within 24 hours.

Do you have some specific examples? Also, you might be interested in what our Founding Fathers had to say about separation of Church and State: “If I could conceive that the general government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.” - George Washing...See More Richard Boyle · San Francisco, California Nelda White White: Those rights are \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They are enumerated in our Declaration of Independence, not our Constitution. The Declaration of Independece does not have the force of law. The Constitution is the law of the land. Article 1 of the Constitution has this to say: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Upon this is based our concept of the separation of church and state. Thomas Jefferson also noted: “Our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry.” - Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom (1779)",

The defense wrapped up Friday after two weeks of testimony that featured a pair of psychiatrists who examined Holmes and found that he was insane. Earlier in the case, two court-appointed doctors testified for the prosecution that Holmes knew the difference between right and wrong at the time of the killings and therefore was sane under Colorado law. In Colorado, prosecutors have the burden of proof in insanity cases. So the defense only needed to raise a reasonable doubt that Holmes was sane.

That isn’t likely to happen until next year. Kimberley Reynolds, a Publix spokeswoman, said this week the company won’t open its first Gastonia location until sometime in 2016. She said the supermarket chain has yet to even set a tentative date for the opening. Or at least it hasn’t set one the higher ups are willing to publicly announce. And the company told media earlier this year that its long anticipated store in nearby Lake Wylie location won’t open until late this year. Lowes ditched its remaining Gastonia stores in February, including locations on Neal Hawkins and Hoffman roads. Almost immediately, word spread that Publix was interested in the Hoffman Road location. The Lakeland, Florida-based grocer confirmed that speculation in April with the purchase of the entire Hoffman Village Shopping Center. It includes the old Lowes property, along with businesses like Hickory Tavern and Lotus Bar and Eatery, for more than $17 million. Tough shoes to fill The departure of Lowes — and the announcement that Publix is at least six months from opening — is bad news for residents of south Gastonia, said J.B. Wiggins. “Between no action at the old Lowes (on Hoffman Road) and the delay of the Harris Teeter project for more than three months, we in south Gastonia are in need of a real grocery store,” Wiggins said. Wiggins was referring to the planned Harris Teeter project near the intersection of Robinwood and Kendrick roads. The company said earlier this year it’s moving forward with the project but, like Publix, won’t open before 2016. The closing of Lowes left a void in the Hoffman Road area that makes it tougher for local residents to find the groceries they want, especially higher end options represented by stores like Harris Teeter or Publix. The next best thing For now, former Lowes customers in the Hoffman Road area say they’ve had to shift how they shop, at least until Publix comes to town. Sandi Weaver said she’s currently trekking across town to another store. “But I hate it,” Weaver said. “It is too large, and I find it expensive. Can’t wait to get Harris Teeter back. I really need a grocer that will shop your order like Lowes.” Like Weaver, Jeremy Eastburn said his family has temporarily switched to a different supermarket but said they’re “anxiously awaiting the opening of Publix.”",

Sure enough, they are breaking that record yet again. In 2011, they achieved the record by shooting a basket from 66.89 meters (219 feet) above the hoop and then in 2013, increased the record to 91.1 meters (299 feet). This time, they chose to shoot the ball from atop Tasmania's Gordon Dam at 140 meters (459 feet) and well, the rest is history. Essentially, they made this shot from atop the equivalent of a 46-story building. No telling how many attempts it took them, but the bottom line is that they eventually made it and have the world record to prove it.",

The treatments may take a bit of effort, but you'll save money and avoid time-consuming and possibly painful visits to the dermatologist. Lifestyle Changes MayoClinic.com states that smoking can create deep wrinkles around your mouth and speed up your skin's natural aging process. Stop smoking to prevent deep wrinkles from forming or getting worse. Sun exposure can also lead to wrinkles around your mouth. If you go out in the sun, apply sunblock to your face to prevent the sun's ultraviolet rays from worsening your wrinkles or creating new wrinkles around your mouth.",

The Genius Beauty website recommends standing in front of the mirror and performing facial exercises for 15 minutes every day to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Start by stretching your mouth as wide as you can, as if saying \"cheese.\" Hold the position for two seconds, then pucker your lips together tightly so that your lips almost touch your nose. Hold this pose for two seconds, then stretch your mouth back into the \"cheese\" position. After two seconds, stretch your lips forward and down, as if saying the word \"go.\" Hold for two seconds, then relax. Repeat the entire routine 20 times.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment NEWPORT — One familiar local face and four former champions highlight the singles field of 32 as the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships swing into action on Saturday at the freshly renovated International Tennis Hall of Fame. Jared Donaldson, the Ponaganset star and R.I. Interscholastic League singles champion in 2012, will take his place on a vastly different stage against a host of top Americans, including two-time winner John Isner, vying for the Van Alen Cup. Donaldson, coached by 2002 Newport champion Taylor Dent, has climbed his way into the world’s top 175 through some strong results on the ATP Challenger circuit. His victory at The Royal Lahaina Challenger in late January and a pair of near misses while attempting to qualify for the main draws at the French Open and Wimbledon speak to the 18-year-old’s improvement, and he’ll figure to have plenty of fan support from the home crowd. Isner — the first top seed to win the title in 2011, breaking the dreaded Casino Curse — figures to be among the favorites again and will be the tournament’s highest-ranked player. Currently in the world’s top 20, he also captured the 2012 crown and could square off with a host of accomplished countrymen. Jack Sock ranks in the top 30 while Sam Querrey and Steve Johnson sit inside the top 60. New singles and doubles champions are already guaranteed this year, as Lleyton Hewitt opted not to return with his retirement set for January following the Australian Open. The three-time Newport finalist captured his 30th professional title by downing Ivo Karlovic in the 2014 title match, grinding out a three-set win, and teamed with fellow Australian Chris Guccione to take the doubles crown in straight sets over Jonathan Erlich and Rajeev Ram. Guccione will partner with Matthew Ebden, another Australian, in an attempt to make it five Newport doubles titles between them — Guccione won with countryman Carsten Ball in 2010 while Ebden teamed with Ryan Harrison to capture the 2011 title. Other past singles champions in the field include Nicholas Mahut (2013), Ram (2009) and wildcard entry Mark Philippoussis (2006), the 38-year-old Australian who was runner-up at the U.S. Open in 1998 and Wimbledon in 2003. Among a host of players looking to make their mark are Bernard Tomic — the 22-year-old Croatian by way of Australia who has broken into the world’s top 25 — and Dustin Brown, who knocked 14-time major winner Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon in the second round this year. The big-serving, 6-foot-11 Karlovic also has to be considered a threat any time he steps foot onto a grass court, and former world No. 2 Tommy Haas has also committed to play in the event for just the second time. The venue itself will be one of the stars of the week after celebrating its grand reopening in May, the end of a three-year, $3-million process that has seen an expansion of the museum to about 2,000 items.

    "DiffbotBody": "The world is sometimes a difficult place, and sometimes while we suffer in darkness, we wonder if God has left us alone. When you find yourself questioning if God has abandoned you, remember these seven important comforting truths. Difficulties and trials are a part of every traveler's journey in life. Sometimes they make us and other times they break us and piece us together into something different. Either way, we come out of these difficulties a different person than we were when we went in. That is the nature of trials. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Some may turn to God in their difficulties, but what happens when we feel that God has abandoned us and forced us to face the darkness alone? Here are seven things to remember when you feel like God has abandoned you. God loves you God is your father, and He loves you with a love that is perfect and unending. You can trust in that. Because you are His child, He cares for you, watches over you, protects you and even mourns with you. We are put here in families with parents so we can understand the bond between parent and child. That love is only a fraction of the love your Heavenly Father feels for you. In the scriptures we are told that charity never faileth. Charity is pure love, and God's love will never fail you. Learn to love Him too so you can more fully feel His love around you. Sometimes a good cry is necessary Sometimes the anger and hate of the world is so painful that we harden our hearts so we can't feel the pain. The trouble with closing our hearts to pain is that once it's closed, love is also locked out. A good cry can help fix what sometimes needs to be broken. The pain and sorrow of a broken heart leaves spaces that God can fill –- that you can feel. A broken heart allows you to cry over the pain and sorrow of your trials, and allows God's love to heal the broken parts. In order for you to know God is there, you have to be able to feel His presence. God will come to you if you ask Often when we feel abandoned, the last thing we want to do is talk to the one who we feel has betrayed us. When it comes to God, however, the best thing you can do is talk to Him and tell Him how you feel. As your father, He wants to hear from you as often as you are willing to let Him be a part of your life. Not only will God listen to every prayer you speak, but He will come to you every time you ask for Him. He may not answer every prayer exactly the way you would like Him to, and He may not answer them immediately, but He will sit with you and comfort you while you wait. If you want God to walk with you, it's important that you talk to Him. Just ask. God sees the end from the beginning Because we are small human beings in a big world, we are so limited in our ability to see beyond what's right in front of us. God, on the other hand, is a supreme being, the creator of the universe, and more importantly, the creator of us. He knows where you're broken and where you need mending. He also knows the experiences needed to heal you. Each trial is part of the perfecting process so when we stand before Him, we can be our best selves. We do not see what He sees nor can we know what He knows. What we can do is trust that each experience He gives us is given to help us grow, to give us experience and to point us in the direction we need to go. Trust Him. God is a God of goodness Everything that is good comes from God. By the same token, everything that comes from God is good, even the hard things. If God is asking you to walk a certain path, know that it is for your good, for your better understanding and for your learning. God wouldn't require you to do something that was going to damage your soul. He is a God that desires to lift you up and make you better than you are. Sometimes, it is our own choices that put us in situations that are dangerous. When you find yourself in any situation that is not good, get out! God will not be there. God is a God of goodness and you will find Him in places of light. If you want to find God, look for those places of light and walk there. We're not meant to suffer alone Isolation can cause loneliness, discouragement and depression. It can rob people of their hope, their will and their self-worth. Trusted friends, on the other hand, can encourage, support, and ground us. They can guide us through troubled waters, offer a hand to hold and cheer us up when our hearts are heavy. A trusted friend can remind us of who we are and where we want to be. Some have been where we are before and can give us a far better perspective on how to travel safely to the other side. A good friend is God's way of sending an angel. Read: 4 reasons atheists and Christians both need to be extremely concerned about this new study God never abandons His children God is a God of love and a God of light. He is also our true father, a father who will never abandon His children. Although the world's fathers may, at times, fail their children, God is perfect and will never ever fail you. You are his precious, beautiful child and although He may at times test you, He will never, ever forsake you. Of this promise you can be sure. Believe in Him and keep moving forward.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Here are a few things she really wants but may not be telling you. The saying goes that \"diamonds are a girl's best friend,\" and, sure, women occasionally enjoy jewelry or grand gestures, but your wife typically wants simpler things from you. Here are seven things you can do to make your wife's eyes really light up. 1. Connect spiritually Whatever your faith or tradition, when both partners take some time each day to do what will build them up spiritually, their bond is strengthened. This may mean praying together, meditating or even sitting quietly in a peaceful spot, perhaps close to nature. She will also appreciate it when you take the initiative to suggest this way of staying close. 2. Listen without trying to fix It may be a truism that men like to solve problems, but she really appreciates when you quietly listen to them without trying to offer a solution. Marriage and family therapist Dr. Jonathan Swinton tells men: \"Don't give unsolicited advice or assume you should fix things. What she needs is to feel heard and understood. That is often the best fix — to help her not feel alone in her struggles.\" She may just need to \"vent\" by talking about what's bothering her. Understanding the process is the key; often, just sharing what's bothering her makes her feel less overwhelmed, even if she hasn't solved the problem. Talking also helps her \"think out loud\" and solve the problem with minimal outside input. 3. Provide a relaxed morning Whatever the demands of her life, it's a nice gift to have other quiet mornings periodically where an overworked woman can sleep in, read and get up at her leisure. A rested wife is a happy wife. To make those mornings particularly enjoyable, a thoughtful husband could make the bed with luxuriously soft bamboo sheets. 4. Put down your phone It's no secret \"technology is affecting all kinds of social interactions,\" Dr. Meghan Tyler tells Australian Women's Health Magazine. Devices in hands and in every room lead to decreased communication and cut into meaningful one-on-one time. Turning off the TV, the computer and the smartphone for an evening once a week or a couple times a month can inject a much-needed dose of togetherness and intimacy into a marriage. It doesn't take much. \"You have to reinvest in your relationship, which doesn't mean spending eight hours a day in it,\" Dr. Tyler says. \"You can spend six seconds or 10 minutes daily and see a change.\" 5. Use a soothing touch Women may be on their feet throughout much of their days, running errands, working, or soothing a fussy child. Those feet would love some TLC at the end of the day. A simple foot rub doesn't take long, but it makes a world of difference in allowing the rest of a busy woman's body to relax and settle in for a much-needed night's sleep. You can make it extra-special by massaging in some lotion that refreshes and softens those hard-working feet, then enveloping them in comfy socks. 6. Recognize how much she loves documenting her little ones If she loves taking photos and videos of your children (and she probably does), why not give her a little something to highlight those memories? Print and frame some of her favorites photos and hang them around the house. Film the kids telling her what they love most about mom. Or have them write a little note about their favorite memory together. She will undoubtedly cherish it. 7. Leave a love note It doesn't have to be long or complicated. In fact, short and sweet will be just perfect. AllProDad.com has some ideas for simple things to write, including what you think about her is beautiful and expressing appreciation for the work she does and sacrifices she makes. Cariloha believes everyone deserves luxury everyday. Seize the moment to spoil her, pamper her and surprise her with a little luxury she will love. Visit Cariloha.com for more gift ideas that will make your woman feel the love she truly deserves.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Southwest Airlines' controversial CEO Gary Kelly appears to have opened a huge hornets' nest in the wake of news about a tentative agreement on a new contract with more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants who work at the low-fare behemoth. With Southwest's largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, Chicago also is the domicile for the largest number of Southwest flight attendants, more than 1,800 altogether, according to a spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents Southwest flight attendants. Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Another flight attendant with more than a decade of work at Southwest offered a similar sentiment in an email: \"The (Local 556) union does appear to be too cozy with management.\" Though so-called \"educators\" have been used by Local 556 in the past to help members sort through and understand details of proposed contracts, some flight attendants questioned that procedure this time around, suggesting it could be another means of influencing— or pressuring — union members to vote in favor of a new contract. Noted one Southwest flight attendant: \"Our union handpicked 100 people to fly into Dallas for 'tentative agreement' training with our union dollars for two days so they could 'educate' the rest of us on the tentative agreement.\" Some flight attendants also wondered why Southwest management was suddenly able to come to tentative terms with flight attendants, while other major unions, including those representing pilots, ramp agents and mechanics, have been unable to get even a tentative deal. Ramp agents, in particular, have been in talks for some four years. Flight attendant contract negotiations had been ongoing for two years. The rank and file members of Local 556 will be able to get their first look at the full contract starting tomorrow. Then they will have 16 days to obtain the proposed contract, read it, digest it and then vote — a shorter time frame than the 30-day window for previous contracts, according to some flight attendants who wonder why this is all suddenly so rushed. A Local 556 spokesman said the contract would be ratified if a majority of those who actually vote cast a vote in favor of ratification. As for the vocal backlash among some rank and file union members to news of the tentative contract, a Local 556 spokesman noted: \"We are a large group and not everyone is going to see things the same way.\" By the end of July, however, it should be clear whether enough flight attendants see the proposed contract the same way Southwest Airlines management and Local 556's executive board apparently do.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A joint letter sent by human rights groups to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of enhanced interrogation techniques revealed by a Senate report released late last year. The letter, signed by Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International, asked Lynch’s office to investigate “torture and other violations of U.S. law” in connection to the programs. A petition with 111,788 signatures was attached to the joint letter. In the six months since the Senate report was released, the letter says, the Obama administration hasn’t taken any steps to criminally investigate the interrogation practices. “The Justice Department has a clear responsibility to carry out a credible and comprehensive criminal investigation into the overwhelming evidence that U.S. officials used torture in violation of U.S. law,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a press release. “The Obama administration’s continued failure to act in the face of this mountain of evidence risks sending the message that torture is a valid policy option rather than the crime that it is.” The Department of Justice, in a statement provided to International Business Times, said that it looked into the programs in both 2009 and again after the torture report was released. \"In 2009, the Attorney General directed a preliminary review of the treatment of certain individuals alleged to have been mistreated while in U.S. Government custody subsequent to the 9/11 attacks. That review generated two criminal investigations, but the Department of Justice ultimately declined those cases for prosecution because the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain convictions beyond a reasonable doubt,\" a spokesman said in an email. \"Those investigators have also reviewed the Senate Committee’s full report and did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination. This inquiry was extraordinarily thorough and we stand by our previously announced decision not to initiate criminal charges.\" The Senate report, released in December, detailed a program that began soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. An initial memo authorized the CIA with considerable discretion over whom to detain in intelligence-gathering operations. From there, and through subsequent memos, the CIA and U.S. intelligence operations were able to establish secret detention centers. Under the rationale that the combatants captured in the war on terror were not protected as prisoners of war under the Geneva convention, a set of so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding were used to force information from prisoners. The interrogation techniques were discontinued through executive action soon after President Barack Obama took office. The report set off a heated public debate, and critics of the program pointed to scant evidence that the interrogation techniques, which were often characterized as torture, had led to significant, reliable intelligence. Earlier this month, the Senate voted to ban waterboarding and \"rectal feeding,\" which would permanently extend Obama’s executive order. “We must continue to insist that the methods we employ in this fight for peace and freedom must always, always, be as right and honorable as the goals and ideals we fight for,” said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a former of prisoner of war. The torture ban was part of a bigger National Defense Authorization Act that the Senate ultimately passed overwhelmingly. A final version of the bill could be passed in early July.",

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTARY | ALEJANDRO ARREDONDO For the past few years, American citizens have lived under the shadow of an imminent financial collapse: the looming “debt ceiling,” as well as Chinese economic dominance. Currently, our national debt exceeds $18 trillion. To relieve the national debt, Congress has repeatedly issued proposals containing complex solutions that focus on either rampantly raising taxes, siphoning funds from major government programs, raising the age requirement to collect Social Security, or creating a larger “debt ceiling.” A key fact that many choose to ignore or simply forget, however, is that nearly 34 percent of U.S. debt belongs to foreign nations. China, as the largest foreign holder of American debt, owns approximately $1.26 trillion of debt in the form of bonds, notes and other financial instruments, according to the Treasury. The second largest holder of American debt is Japan, possessing a sum of debt in excess of $1.2 trillion as well. Our U.S. government, however, has yet to collect on the Chinese debt that we hold in our vaults, in our bank accounts, and in our homes. American companies, banks and over 20,000 private investors and U.S. citizens own almost $1 trillion worth of debt in historic bonds and notes. There is a simple solution that would help Americans redeem their bonds, but one that seems to elude Congress: By performing a stateto state debt swap, we would drastically reduce our debt and prevent the interest rates attached to the debt from further consuming our budget. The swap entails China redeeming the bonds that are owned by the U.S. government and by private American investors at market value, and then the U.S. government swap the bonds in the Treasury for a reduction in the total debt that China holds. The swap would even out the debt between the two nations and should leave American investors satisfied. To have some context, these historical bonds were a byproduct of the various wars waged by China in the early 20th century. In 1911, the Chinese people overthrew the Qing dynasty leading to the eventual founding of the Guomindang, the Chinese nationalist party. The resultant power vacuum led to the turbulent Warlord Period as well as the Northern expedition under Chiang Kai-Shek. Victorious and increasingly popular, the GMD established itself as the reigning political leader of China. But when communism began to gain influence in the Eastern hemisphere, various revolutionaries established the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. The ideological conflicts between these two major political parties propelled China into first and second Chinese Civil War. And to fund the multiple wars and conflicts, the Nanjing government issued a plethora of different bonds, such as the Liberty bonds and the Super Petchillis, to foreign nations. In essence, the purchasing of these bonds by the United States symbolized good will and represented a step toward successful and prosperous Sino-American relations, but apparently, the expulsion of the GMD to Taiwan and the CCP’s rise to power is reason enough to forget its debts to foreign countries. It is not only unfair that the United States pays its debts in a timely fashion, and China refuses to pay theirs. It is a violation of both international laws set by the World Trade Organization, of which China is a member, as they have yet to fulfill their financial responsibilities. In fact, China paid Britain for their bonds in the 1987 China-Brit Treaty, but purposely excluded American bondholders from the negotiations. Furthermore, the Chinese government, PRC, can object and attempt to make the feeble argument that debt is the responsibility of the former government, GMD; however, they are violating the “Successor Government Doctrine,” which clearly states that, if a government succeeds another, then it assumes its assets as well as its liabilities, according to Resolution 160 of the 110th Congress. It is a dangerous game to allow foreign nations to hold a substantial claim to America’s debt. And it is more dangerous to permit another nation to absolve itself from debt because it displays utter weakness, a trait that is unrepresentative of the United States. The American people must realize that the government has a stake in Chinese debt. If this continues, will this kind of foreign policy establish a precedent for other countries to ignore their debts to the United States? This current scenario is troubling, and citizens must compel their representatives to diminish the United States’ debt and reverse the current trend of inaction. Alejandro Arredondo recently graduated from the International Baccalaureate at Lamar Academy in McAllen and plans to attend St. Edwards University in Austin in the fall, where he will study finance and political science.",

    "LabBody": "Methodology. Companies are ranked by total revenues for their respective fiscal years. Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years' data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K. Revenues. Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spinoff is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks and savings institutions are interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. Profits. Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2013 profits to 2014 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting. Balance Sheet. Assets are the company’s year-end total. Total stockholders’ equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company’s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company’s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity. Employees. The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee. Earnings Per Share. The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company’s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded. Total Return to Investors. Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company’s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2014 of stock owned at the end of 2004, 2009, and 2013. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spinoffs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded. Medians. No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2013 to 2014 do not include companies that lost money in 2013 or lost money in both 2013 and 2014, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases. Credits. This Fortune 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Richard K. Tucksmith and Rhona Altschuler. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, she used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S\u0026P Capital IQ to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support. Edith Fried reviewed and edited nonstatistical information. Researchers Viki Goldman and Kathleen Lyons assisted with the data gathering and verification. The data verification process was aided substantially by information provided by S\u0026P Capital IQ. Other sources used were: FactSet Research Systems, Hoover’s and Morningstar Document Research.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Check out McGregor's exclusive training camp workout and start training like a fighter now. THE WARMUP Dynamic Stretching Duration: 10-15 min. For the workout: Perform exercises 1A-1C as a circuit, then do the heavy bag and grappling.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Lisa Kohl, a 27-year-old corporate executive in Munich, has watched the ceaseless debate over the latest bailout package for Greece with concern. The COO of a German market research company, Kohl said she already pays high taxes as a single person with no children, and many Germans worry that further economic unraveling in Greece could cost Germany more money. “If we continue paying, what are we paying for?” said Kohl, echoing what she described as the sentiment of many in Germany. Kohl is one of many young Germans closely watching the debate over a solution for Greece. German millennials are part of the first generation to grow up in the single currency eurozone, and they have seen their country serve as a European Union leader for years. As unmarried young people without children, they often pay high taxes, and see themselves as bankrolling a large chunk of Greece's debt. Many are deeply invested in the situation in Greece, but are divided over whether the German government should express solidarity with their fellow Europeans in Athens or continue to take a firm stance on Greece repaying its debt. In January, 61 percent of Germans were in favor of Greece leaving the Eurozone, according to poll data. The same poll reported that 68 percent were against debt forgiveness and that 4 out of 5 people polled favored strict austerity measures. By late Thursday, the Greek government had bent considerably toward the German position, proposing a fresh bailout in exchange for accepting a broad package of spending cuts. Yet if a deal fails to materialize or if it comes without forgiveness for the enormous debts the Greek government now shoulders, many young Germans fear that they will ultimately be the ones paying the bills. Some of the fear concerning higher taxes may be unfounded, since the German government owns only a portion of Greece’s debt -- the rest of it being held by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and other governments and private banks throughout Europe. But private entities now only own 17 percent of Greece’s debt and European governments hold the lion's share: almost 62 percent of 322 billion euros. The German government has the highest stake of those Euro-area governments, making German taxpayers responsible for 65 billion euros, according to Bloomberg. “Greece Is Mocking The Rest Of Europe” Discussions surrounding debt forgiveness and the possibility of additional loans to Greece have long raged in Germany, given their large stake in Greek debt. These debates were stoked by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ visit to Strasbourg on Wednesday, where he discussed an additional 3-year loan proposal with European creditors. The new deal that Tsipras has put on the table involves a 53.5 billion euro bailout in exchange for budget and spending cuts. Young Germans have been less affected by the recession that has walloped Europe in recent years. Germany has the lowest youth unemployment rate in the European Union, while Greece’s number of unemployed young people is the second highest in the region, trailing only Spain. Still, many young Germans who are pro-austerity said they were worried Greece’s financial troubles could hurt their futures. Many talked about the need for safe spending when it comes to Greece. \"Younger people are not necessarily angry, but they feel that everything that has been done in the past two, three and four years has been for nothing -- that all the money has been wasted that could’ve been put into much better use,” said Ferdinand Vogel, 23, a student and German National Guard trainee officer who writes the current events blog “Young German.” Vogel, who lives in Berlin, said Greece needed to take more responsibility for its actions before debt forgiveness could even be put on the table. “If Greece wants to stay in the EU, it should abide by the standards of the EU,\" he said. Torsten Heinrich, 32, a writer and former youth organizer for the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, said he was fed up with the empty promises made by Tsipiras’ Syriza-led government. “Greece is mocking the rest of Europe,” said Heinrich, of Wurzburg in southern Germany. “They have promised reforms; they haven’t done anything. Instead they are asking for more money and more money ... Patience is running out.” Heinrich said he supported debt forgiveness, but only because he thought it was inevitable. “The Greeks will never be able to pay [their loans] back,” he said. Continuing Faith In The European Project Critics of Germany’s hard stance on Greece’s debt crisis, however, point to Germany’s experiences with debt forgiveness after World War II as an example of how the German government has acted hypocritically toward Greece in the past five years. In 1953, with the London Debt Agreement, Germany was forgiven around 50 percent of the debts it had incurred during reconstruction following the war. One of the major signatories of this European agreement was Greece. The agreement, in conjunction with the Marshall Plan, which provided multiple billions of dollars to post-war Germany, kept the German economy from being strangled by debt and allowed it to become the strongest economy in Europe today. People line up to buy rare goods on Berlin's market, during the Berlin occidental zone blockade by Russia, in June 1948. JEAN MANZON/AFP/Getty Images In fact, one of Tsipiras' first official acts as prime minister was to suggest that Germany pay reparations to Greece for the destruction caused when the country was occupied during the Second World War -- a move that outraged Merkel. Germany’s unforgiving tone toward Greece these days is ironic, said Timothy Guinnane, a professor of historical economics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who has written about the London Debt Agreement of 1953. “In 1953, the poor Greeks were helping the rich Germans,” he said in a phone interview. Many young Germans understand the crisis through this kind of solidarity. Julian Greth, 24, an engineering student from Munich, described the Greek population as the “victims” of the crisis -- not the Germans. He also said that everything in Europe was connected and that the EU could not simply kick Greece out without any broader repercussions. His stake in Greece is more than one of a future taxpayer. Greth is somewhat of a Grecophile and has traveled to Greece four times on vacation. “As a country, it’s still the same -- friendly, helpful,” he said of his recent experience in Greece. Matthias Adler, a 34 year-old freelance writer from Berlin, argued that Greeks deserve Germany’s financial and emotional support. Adler was born and raised in Berlin by left-wing parents and said that a good deal of his politics and those of his friends who share his views stem from their geographic location and their upbringing. The politics of south Germany, he said, tended to be more conservative and pro-austerity by comparison. From Adler’s perspective, Greece leaving the EU is unimaginable. He said he couldn't understand the fierce anger many Germans felt toward Greeks and that he would continue to stand in solidarity with them. “In my opinion, it’s not a Greek problem, it’s a European problem,” he said. “We Germans are the ones who have profited the most from this whole European Union, and I hope we don’t forget that.\"",

The Texas senator's book ranks fourth on The Wall Street Journal hardcover list and fourth on the Publisher's Weekly hardcover list, Politico points out. And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",
    "LabBody": "Martin O'Malley wants the U.S. to accept as many as 13 times the number of Syrian refugees it currently plans to take in. The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "LabBody": "HANAU, Germany (AP) - A U.S. Army sergeant who beheaded his wife's lover and brought the head to her hospital bed so she could see what he had done was convicted of murder Friday. After the verdict, the victim's mother, Irene Glover of Phoenix, made a brief and tearful statement mourning the loss of her 21-year-old son, Gregory. \"I used to have a spark in my eye and a jump in my step, but now I'm nothing,\" she said. \"A part of me is gone.\" Her son died Dec. 7 in a gruesome climax to a lovers' triangle at the U.S. Army base at Fulda in central Germany. The defendant, Sgt. Stephen Schap, 26, of Baltimore, figured out his wife, Diane, was pregnant by Glover. Schap found Glover at a telephone booth talking to Schap's wife, who was in the hospital with a pregnancy problem. Schap stabbed Glover 10 to 15 times with a double-edged knife and, witnesses testified, kicked the victim's head off. He then stalked away carrying the head, saying sarcastically, \"And he said he was sorry.\" Diane Schap, 26, also of Baltimore, testified Wednesday that her husband came into her hospital room with Glover's head and said: \"Look, Diane, Glover's here. He'll sleep with you every night, only you won't sleep at night.\" About six months pregnant, she testified her husband told her he had studied and planned the killing and did it because he loved her. A jury of four officers and three non-commissioned officers deliberated less than two hours before reaching the guilty verdict. The judge, Lt. Col. Charles E. Trant, said he would instruct the jury to impose the mandatory life sentence when the court went back into session Saturday. Schap's defense argued in vain for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter on grounds he was in an irrational rage when he killed Glover. Defense lawyer David Court said in his closing argument Friday that Schap was so devoted to his wife that he had a vasectomy three years ago after she had three miscarriages and he did not want to cause her more pain.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Many Cambridge City Councilors say they feel rushed as they weigh in a Planning Board petition to amend the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center parcel in Kendall Square. The petition, a conceptual framework of what could be built on the parcel, proposes changes to the city’s PUD-KS District, which is mostly occupied by the Volpe site. The Planning Board and Ordinance Committee must vote on the petition, which will then go before the City Council. As part of the process, the city released three-dimensional models of four theoretical scenarios for the Volpe parcel, including a large 1,000-foot commercial tower. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the federal Department of Transportation are hoping to convert the existing 14-acre campus — composed of six buildings built in the 1960s and in need of major repairs and alterations — into a new state-of-the-art facility of up to 400,000 gross square feet for up to 1,300 personnel and parking spaces. GSA issued a request for information last August from developers interested in acquiring the land and expanding the development. The government is looking for a company to create a new home for the transportation center on Broadway, Third and Binney streets in exchange for ownership of a portion of the land. The part of the site — approximately three acres — that would remain under federal ownership would be designed and constructed in accordance to federal government standards. However, the approximate 11 acres conveyed out to exchange partners would be subject to Cambridge laws. The goal of the proposed petition is to set forth the zoning that would apply to the developer’s part of the process, according to Planning Board Chairman H. Theodore Cohen. “We’re setting up zoning for what we would like to see occur,” Cohen said on Monday at a joint Ordinance Committee and Planning Board meeting, adding that the Planning Board will likely make a recommendation to City Council at its next meeting on July 14. Proposed changes. According to a letter from Cohen to the City Council, the proposed changes aim to implement zoning recommendations of the Kendall Square K2 Study, as well as objectives that have been discussed since the completion of the study. Under the petition, 10 percent of the total housing must be affordable and available to low- and moderate-income households, and five percent must be available to middle-income households. Some councilors, however, say 10 percent affordable housing just isn’t adequate. “Sometimes I feel that there are numbers that are put out there without backup,” Councilor Marc McGovern said. “I think we should be shooting for closer to 25 percent, certainly no less than 20. We’re getting 20 percent in other developments now.” Planning Board members discussed having a requirement of up to 20 percent affordable units, but most members supported the minimum 10 percent stipulation, according to Cohen. Planning Board Vice-Chair Catherine Preston Connolly said board members wanted as much affordable housing as possible, but they were concerned about the high cost of the project. “The federal government requires that their new building be completely constructed, finished and move-in ready before you can take down the Volpe building,” Preston Connolly said. “They have to do that and have all the costs associated with building that before the developer can start anything [on the other parcel].” The Cambridge Residents Alliance feels the city must increase the proportion of residential to commercial units, according to Vice President Lee Farris. The group, Farris said, wants the maximum commercial space to be 40 percent instead of 60 percent. “Because Cambridge doesn’t have a lot of affordable housing and people are being displaced, it is unacceptable that the amount of affordable to low- and moderate-income housing would be reduced to 10 percent from 11.5 percent,” Farris said, adding that any increase above the current FAR (Floor Area Ratio) should go to housing. The petition requires retail and other active ground-floor space along major streets, with incentives for small retail spaces. But councilors want to see diverse ground-floor retail with affordable establishments that respect the neighborhood, such as supermarkets and mom-and-pop stores. “We have to meet the right language that gives us affordable retail,” Councilor Denise Simmons said. “There’s a feeling in the community that Kendall Square is for the intelligentsia of Cambridge and that Central Square is for the people that don’t have nine degrees behind their name and that shouldn’t be the feeling. We have to be very thoughtful and deliberate.” Open space. The current zoning calls for redevelopment of the site to include 7.5 acres of open space – more than half of the total acreage. The zoning also allows development at a 3.0 FAR. Therefore, large development parcels would be required to have a minimum of 40 percent of residential development, and at least 42 percent of the development parcel must be open space, including an area devoted to a public park. The petition, on the other hand, requests that at least 25 percent of the site (3.5 acres) be devoted to open space and five percent of the community space be allocated to innovation space, including startups. Several residents raised concerns about the open-space stipulation, including members of the East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) who said the city did not contact the group prior to drafting such an important petition. ECPT members also say the density of the development requires a major park, according to Jaquith. Councilors say they want open space and retail on the parcel to be a family/residential friendly space. Massing plans and three-dimensional models. The city recently released three-dimensional models of four theoretical scenarios for the Volpe parcel: two slender residential towers 350 feet and 500 feet high; one residential tower of up to 500 feet in height; three commercial towers, one 500 feet and two 350 feet tall; and one large commercial tower of 1,000 feet high. The city decided to model the latter after Councilor Leland Cheung suggested the Volpe site is the ideal location within the city to build a skyscraper 1,000-feet high. The model is not under consideration at the moment, according to the Community Development Department. “I’m comfortable with a tall building,” he said. “It’s really interesting to see when you lay it on the map how much more open space you can get if we consolidate the buildings rather than having several shorter buildings.” Councilor Dennis Carlone stressed the need to build a composition where buildings respect each other and tie the area together. He said the Planning Board must clearly define what they mean by “exceptional architectural quality” in the maximum building height section of the petition. Councilors voiced concerns about feeling rushed, except for Mayor David Maher who said he feels the redevelopment of the Volpe site is an exciting way to improve Kendall Square. “We have the opportunity to make it an even more exciting place with the addition of open space, more housing,” Maher said. “This is an opportunity for us to be able to create and to have place-making that makes good sense going forward without being under the gun of having a developer say, ‘It’s this or nothing.’” Councilors held the petition in committee and requested that the Planning Board prepare a memorandum addressing the issues raised at the meeting. The next hearing will likely be held in August, but an exact date has not been scheduled.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Taking down the Confederate flag flown on government property is something we should have done a while back. The key here is flags flown on government property. It’s an easy call for us libertarians, since we don’t believe government should even have property. The Democrats, the party of hollow symbolic gestures, had a rare win (in their minds) last week when South Carolina removed the Confederate battle flag flown on the grounds of the state capital, and which was put there by Democrat icon Sen. “Fritz” Hollings. Liberals are always just one empty gesture away from solving any problem they conjure up. Every four years, S.C. is voted by the Electoral College as “Most Likely to Secede.” Now the flag is gone and, finally, our racial issues are behind us. Like getting rid of that last pair of pleated pants in the closet, we knew we had to do it. We just needed a reason. In truth, liberal democrats didn’t take that flag down. Nor did South Carolina do it because Taylor Swift said to. The reaction by the people of Charleston to the horrific shooting in the AME Church brought the flag down. They acted with dignity, reason, grace and love. They didn’t let race merchants like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson take over. We should be proud of the South and the way Charleston handled the tragedy. We southerners do not like arrogant, elitist liberals in high-tax, decaying, northern cities telling us what to do. We like it here. You never hear anyone say, “Hey we are retiring and moving north.” Notice that non-issues erupt in devastating riots, looting and harm in communities like Ferguson and Baltimore in the Democrat-controlled North. Property values are down 35% in Ferguson and shootings have skyrocketed in Baltimore. A Democrat reaction to a problem is usually the start of a new problem. Each racially tinged occurrence does not mean you can loot a big screen TV; that is not what Dr. King had in mind. Democrats always seize on tragedy to blame, bloviate and demand more gun laws. The idiotic Charleston killer, Dylann Roof, would not have been permitted to buy a gun since he admitted to felony drug possession on his application. But the Feds botched it and let him buy a gun. And we need more laws? We can’t enforce what we have. Leftists don’t debate anymore, they personally attack. Trump’s political statements about illegal immigrants put a target on his back and cost him $50 million. The Hispanic Miss USA jumped on him but wouldn’t give up her crown. She said, “I won’t take this tacky, over-the-top thing off my head until Donald Trump is willing to do the same.” Even private businesses cave to media pressure. Disney ordered a statue of Bill Cosby removed from one of its theme parks because it cost the company a lot to have to pull the Bill Cosby statue off Sleeping Beauty all the time. Totalitarian regimes like ISIS and North Korea seek to re-write their history, not America. Where does it end? Where do free speech and the speech police settle this? The Democrat Party, recently led by Klan organizer Sen. Robert Byrd, need not lecture the South on race. He used the “N” word and rose to power, and he always applauded at the wrong times in Gone With the Wind. The North has a lot more issues than the South. We differ in so many ways, more so today than when Obama took office. He vilifies Southerners because we do not vote for Democrats. Eric Holder had the Southern states on his speed dial, ready to sue over any perceived \"racial issue.\" In short, the North and the South are like two different countries, which was the South's point when we seceded.

Each racially tinged occurrence does not mean you can loot a big screen TV; that is not what Dr. King had in mind. Democrats always seize on tragedy to blame, bloviate and demand more gun laws. The idiotic Charleston killer, Dylann Roof, would not have been permitted to buy a gun since he admitted to felony drug possession on his application. But the Feds botched it and let him buy a gun. And we need more laws? We can’t enforce what we have. Leftists don’t debate anymore, they personally attack. Trump’s political statements about illegal immigrants put a target on his back and cost him $50 million. The Hispanic Miss USA jumped on him but wouldn’t give up her crown. She said, “I won’t take this tacky, over-the-top thing off my head until Donald Trump is willing to do the same.” Page 2 of 2. - The PC crowd even made a big deal over Paula Deen and her son doing a promotional photo dressed up as Lucy and her husband, Ricky Ricardo (of I Love Lucy), because they used makeup to make Deen's son look Hispanic. After they ban Confederate flags from Wal-Mart, the left will next call for all face makeup darker than NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo's complexion to be removed from the shelves. Now there is talk of digging up Confederate generals. Even private businesses cave to media pressure. Disney ordered a statue of Bill Cosby removed from one of its theme parks because it cost the company a lot to have to pull the Bill Cosby statue off Sleeping Beauty all the time. Totalitarian regimes like ISIS and North Korea seek to re-write their history, not America. Where does it end? Where do free speech and the speech police settle this? The Democrat Party, recently led by Klan organizer Sen. Robert Byrd, need not lecture the South on race. He used the “N” word and rose to power, and he always applauded at the wrong times in Gone With the Wind. The North has a lot more issues than the South. We differ in so many ways, more so today than when Obama took office. He vilifies Southerners because we do not vote for Democrats. Eric Holder had the Southern states on his speed dial, ready to sue over any perceived \"racial issue.\" In short, the North and the South are like two different countries, which was the South's point when we seceded.

    "LabBody": "MANLY | Hannah Ausenhus had no idea what to expect this year. The only thing she knew coming into this season was that Central Springs needed a pitcher after losing all-stater Lexi Korte to graduation. The season opener arrived and Panthers coach Belinda Nelson decided it was the right time to throw Ausenhus, an eighth-grader, in the circle. What has resulted has been much better than anyone expected. Friday, in a Class 2A regional semifinal, things got a little bit sweeter. Ausenhus tossed a no-hitter as No. 7 Central Springs topped South Hamilton 3-0 to move the Panthers one win away from a berth in the state tournament. “I just wanted to come out strong and relaxed and have my defense help me behind me,” Ausenhus said. And help her defense did. In the second inning, while a no-hitter was still the furthest thing from Ausenhus and Panthers’ minds, shortstop Morgan Kelley made a great play on a bloop right behind the circle in which she went full extension to snag the ball, which would’ve most likely gone for a single, just before it hit the ground. The final play in the field was perhaps the most important. With two outs in the seventh and one strike away from completing the no-hitter, South Hamilton designated hitter Ronnie Olson sent a sharp liner into right field. With her glove extended, Central Springs right fielder back-handed the ball and made a sliding grab for the final out and a new souvenir for Ausenhus to remember this performance. “This group is all about team. There’s no I’s,” Nelson said. “This group just goes out to play together and they support each other no matter what and I love that about them.” It was Ausenhus’ third no-hitter of her career – her first coming in a 7-0 win over North Butler and second in an 11-0 win in five innings over Riceville. Coming into Friday, the task looked to be a tough one as South Hamilton had put up 14 runs in each of its first two tournament games. “I knew I had to throw hard and make my movement go and they just swung at them,” Ausenhus, who finished her night with nine strikeouts and three walks, said. “The one thing, when she comes she doesn’t have any nerves,” Nelson added. “She’s so coachable and (assistant coach) Angela (Korte) and her work right together and they know what’s working and what’s not.” The Panthers wasted no time getting on the board as Anna Dietrich scored on a passed ball in the first inning. Haliee Ausenhus gave her sister Hannah another boost in the fourth inning when she drove a home run over the left field fence. Kelli Wilson drove in Central Springs’ final run of the contest in the fifth on a groundout that scored Dietrich. The Panthers (26-5) advance to a regional final Monday against Manson-Northwest Webster (10-17) at Mason City. The winner will advance to the Class 2A state tournament. “These three seniors (Kaitlyn Faught, Brittany Florea and Casey Kisner), they wanted to do this and I’m excited for them. I hope we can go and finish it,” Nelson said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single. Its ornate but in-the-pocket production is as silky and flawlessly orchestrated a track as Quik has made since the late '90s, and it boasted one of the best lead-off lines for a rap verse this year: \"Now what they want to go cancel Arsenio Hall for?/ Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for.\" Hall’s talk show rose to prominence in the early '90s, around the same time that Quik was finding commercial success, and he appeared on \"Arsenio\" a few times both to rap and DJ; last year—on a newly resurrected version of the show—the rapper announced the release of The Midnight Life. In a song that mostly celebrates living in the present—more focused on the narrative of maintaining than reclaiming glory—the nostalgic line feels poignant; like second-time-loser Arsenio, the perpetually \"most underrated\" Quik has been declared down for the count more than once, and may now be winding down himself. But as in the case of most of Quik’s work, the complaint is just a point in the rapper’s tangled constellation of talking points (mainly, taunts and come-ons to adversaries, fair-weather fans, and the female population of South Central at large), which are as full of ingenious contradictions as his beats. —Winston Cook-Wilson DJ Quik: \"Pet Sematary\" There was a time when the killing in a Lauryn Hill song was done softly and figuratively, through the power of music. That time was long ago. In the late 1990s, a false rumor about the singer/songwriter who would become perhaps rap's most gifted recluse supposedly saying she'd rather die than have white people buying her albums spread so widely there's a Snopes.com page dedicated to debunking it. Over the years since the former Fugees member's sole solo studio album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as she has drifted in and out of the public eye, her self-aggrandizing statements and unfortunate habit of showing up late for live shows have continued to divide, in ways that still say more about the culture than about her. When Hill went to prison to serve a three-month sentence for tax evasion in 2013, she opened herself to further miscomprehension by discussing her conviction in terms of slavery, colonialism, and institutionalized racism. It might not have played well in Peoria, but she was bringing up a legacy America has yet to escape, in ways that became tragically obvious this year. In the same pre-prison pronouncement, Hill said, \"You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\" In 2012, she had premiered a spoken-word piece titled \"Black Rage\", which turned the lyrical framework of Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein's \"My Favorite Things\" into a prolix litany of the crimes that one group of people have perpetrated against another, and a stinging endorsement of anger as an antidote to fear; in later live versions the interpolation became, like John Coltrane's classic cover, a musical one, as well. When the artist, now known professionally as Ms. Lauryn Hill, shared \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" in late August, with a call for peace in Missouri, the times had caught up with her song. She once told an interviewer, \"If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children,\" and this sketch, recorded in her living room, benefits by couching its broad social themes in family-like intimacy; her kids' voices can be heard behind her deepening, huskier roar, along with acoustic guitar and a murmuring rhythm. Some will share Hill's fury, some won't, but her unexpurgated message of focused resilience points toward part of what has been missing all along: A mutual understanding. To promote a new pay-for-view concert video, Hill recently shared a clip of herself performing the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" live in Brooklyn. In the song, as on the original, she raps, \"While you're imitating Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone.\" Simone, the subject of a controversial upcoming biopic, prefigured aspects of Hill's career trajectory in her own evolution toward racial confrontation. Simone reportedly warned Martin Luther King Jr., on meeting him, that she wasn't nonviolent. \"Not to worry, sister,\" King responded; she even later insisted upon being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" You'd never guess it by the ongoing rounds of backlash against Hill, which prompted Talib Kweli to write an essay defending her this year, but this mere Ms. has yet to go as far in her radicalism as the late legend, who, singing the then-new \"Mississippi Goddam\" at Carnegie Hall in 1964, blithely informed a mostly white audience, \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies/ You're all gonna die and die like flies.\" But \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" belongs to that tradition, one of righteous indignation in the face of injustice, speaking to the persecuted wherever they may be, whatever they might look like. And it shows that, for all the actual death and cruelty in the headlines, the sound of music can still be quietly devastating. —Marc Hogan The other side of \"Chorus\", a 12'' single issued at the start of the year by the globally minded electronic producer Holly Herndon, sounds like an audition tape for the relatively esoteric sound-art label Editions Mego. During \"Solo Voice\", slivers and snapshots of her voice twist into pointillist spires—chirpy and more musical than the most recent experiments of clear inspiration Florian Hecker, but only by degrees. Even Herndon’s most kinetic work has always seemed as driven by ideas as approachability, and \"Solo Voice\" is an unabashed expression of the former. Could a disembodied and dissected human voice be built into something new with computers? \"Chorus\" explores a similar line of inquiry. Herndon splits her simple, fetching melody into bits, so that her words seem sung by a cyborg programmed with a speech impediment. Syllables end abruptly, stand alone, and stretch over open space. But Herndon twists those samples of herself around beats that sometimes boom and burst like dubstep and sometimes stutter and sprint like IDM. In the space between the two, Herndon laces a panoply of fragments gathered piecemeal as she browsed online. The result, vividly illustrated in a subsequent video collaboration with Japanese artist Akihiko Taniguchi, blurs the relationship between web and browser, machine and user, data and devourer. Herndon becomes the principal input in a system bigger than herself, and she tries to be altered without being absorbed. It’s a canny reflection on our digital lives, rendered with a physicality that pulls it back into our own mainframe. —Grayson Haver Currin \"I Am Not Afraid\", the track that kicks off the gorgeous In Conflict, is as much a riddle as it is a song. Those who may have arrived at Owen Pallett’s music by way of his theoretical explications of pop tracks wouldn’t have been surprised at the obvious intelligence of the writing here, or the foreboding and beauty of the music behind it. It would have been more discomfiting to reckon with the intense strangeness of lyrics that seem several worlds away from the crush-love-heartbreak-repeat cycle of the pop music Pallett clearly understands so well. Pallett has said that In Conflict is the first of his records on which he tried to write lyrics that were both non-allegorical and autobiographical. But even if the material \"I Am Not Afraid\" draws upon comes from Pallett’s own life, the song is extraordinarily rich in imagery and metaphor, whether it’s Pallett leaving his \"violin unattended in a cab or restaurant\" or sharing lyrics like \"They told me to chew on a toothpick/ They told me to take a deep breath.\" These are depictions of anxiety and anger—heady emotions clashing with the record’s central message that its subject is not afraid and salvation may be found in discipline. So while there’s clearly that eponymous conflict in effect here, the idea motivating the song remains fleeting. The music of \"I Am Not Afraid\" is mostly gorgeous as it transitions from violin to piano and back, but it is also strange, and sometimes frightening (a result of Pallett dropping what he calls \"black notes\"—i.e., the exact wrong note for the melody—into the mix). Accepting the discomfort of the very music here, and accepting the discomfort of the lyrics, becomes both a metaphor and a microcosm of the experience that those born into any of the groups that hold dominion (whites, males, cisgenders) must undertake to reckon with their unearned status. To draw on what Pallett has said directly, this musical and lyrical confusion also functions as a metaphor for his own \"displacement and dysphoria.\" By taking the political and rendering it both personal and deliberately inscrutable, Pallett has managed to confound in the best way possible and create a relatable pop experience for voices that are too often ignored. —Jonah Bromwich It’s been an art from blues to Britney: the song as extended double entendre, one that can come off either unassailably clean or unspeakably filthy depending on the listener’s life experience and cleanliness of mind (or nearness to a Google searchbox). \"Love Me Harder\" is sort of the opposite: even when it’s clean it sounds teasingly off, and even when it’s dirty, it sounds so disarmingly spit-shine clean. Much of it’s the premise: pairing a singer who was a babysitter on Nickelodeon less than half a year ago with a singer whose discography contains endless variations on permanently corrupting young ingenues, with no apologies and no inclinations to change that. Even more of it’s the execution: organ peals timed like winks after each line; Grande switching emotional beats like poses, her voice either knowing beyond her years or just polished to sound like it, with no indication as to which; Tesfaye revisiting the sturdy nocturnal electro-house of his Kavinsky collaboration (a sound that’s been fast adopted by the pop trickbook, from megastars to newcomers), leering about his rep and finding a way to describe hardcore porn acts in PG terms. When these tracks fail, they’re the most embarrassing failures an artist can have; when they succeed, the sleight of song can be breathtaking. Here’s to a generation of kids realizing horrifying things in 2020 about their teenage jam—and what lodged it in their mind. —Katherine St. Asaph Ariana Grande: \"Love Me Harder\" [ft. The Weeknd] Tobias Jesso Jr. isn't the first guy to have his heart squashed by Los Angeles. After failing to make it as a pop songwriter, breaking up with his girlfriend, getting hit by a car, and—icing on the cake—moving to to Vancouver to help care for his ailing mother, balloons fell from the ceiling as Jesso became the world's one billionth failed songwriter. So he dusted off his sister's old piano, wrote a few heart-stricken ballads, and posted them to Youtube. What happened next was unlikely: An email to Chet \"JR\" White (whose band Girls had just broken up) led to a True Panther signing and bam—Jesso's back on his feet, with a debut tiled Goon slated for next year. His breakthrough track, \"True Love\", is perhaps an even less likely success. About as bald-faced and hopelessly romantic as music in 2014 comes, Jesso calls on the spirits of the underdog singer-songwriters of the '70s (think Randy Newman circa Good Old Boys), nicks the melody from Nelly's \"Dilemma\" almost wholesale, and delivers one of the best lump-in-your throat choruses of the year. Which isn't to mention that it sounds like a half-tempo version of the saddest '80s sitcom theme song ever recorded. But there's something so worn and natural about it, it's hard to think of it as anything but the purest declaration of the heart. Call up the YouTube video for \"True Love\", and you'll find a family photograph of Jesso at maybe seven or eight-years-old, looking up at the camera with his fingers poking at a cheap Casio keyboard. It's hard not to believe the kid would make it after all. —Zach Kelly Tobias Jesso Jr.: \"True Love\" Beyoncé hasn’t been a traditional singles artist for years—4, her 2011 opus, didn’t even put anything in the top 10. And when you Beyoncé not only an album into the world but over a dozen songs with prime-time-ready videos, the formula’s bound to be shaken even further. The obvious industry singles—Ryan Tedder collab \"XO\", erstwhile Katy Perry song \"Pretty Hurts\", whatever “Standing on the Sun” was supposed to be in the months Before Knowles—floundered; even \"Drunk in Love\", a bona fide hit that rode the pomp and TV performance circuit to No. 2, seemed more like a populist underdog fighting chart trends than a preordained smash. Yet there were alternatives: 14 songs, all different, yet each personality-packed, like a personality quiz without any of the data-mining malaise—except the sort that produces people’s-choice singles. And the people’s choice, it turns out, was \"Partition\". If Beyoncé-the-statement was reducible to a single track, this would be it. Jay-Z asserts his presence without actually commandeering the track to rap about breastses and breakfast. Beyoncé thoroughly enjoys her reverie, fetishizing their own celebrity because who else gets to do it? And the track balances no-nonsense hitmaking—the hook’s her most traditionally urban radio-ready since B’Day, the beat roaring from simmer to insatiable and back within seconds—and nonchalant trolling. If you think \"Partition\" is a load of oversharing in a cab seat, Beyoncé is mocking you via a French Big Lebowski lecture. If you think \"Partition\" is a big cameras-flashing FEMINIST TRIUMPH, Beyoncé will make you frame that around a goofy Big Lebowski quote, knowing you’ll share it on all platforms anyway. It’s provocative, let’s say; it gets the people going. —Katherine St. Asaph It wasn’t so long ago that being a Young Thug fan felt like you were in on rap’s most rewarding secret. Revelling in the unpredictability of his I Came From Nothing mixtape series, I can honestly admit that, no, I didn’t see his success coming: even at his poppiest, Thug felt way too weird to transcend cult status. Even on his breakthrough release, 2013’s 1017 Thug, the bits that rose to the top were highly tweetable but barely marketable; keep in mind, this was still pre-\"Versace\", a song that would be used as a punchline by \"serious\" rap fans as often as it would be celebrated later that year. That feels like ages ago. Thug closes 2014 as, if not quite a household name, an unavoidable presence in the rap landscape. A short list of stars who co-opted his once-singular swag this year includes Nicki Minaj, T.I., Gucci Mane, and Lil Wayne (his closest spiritual progenitor, who at this point feels prudish in relation), not to mention the dozens of impressionable ATLiens who’ve practically made his yelps and chirps into its own subgenre. It isn’t that Thug’s succeeded in spite of his quirks: they’ve become the hook. The odder he gets, the more people respond, his endless idiosyncrasies feeding the insatiable demand for clicks that’s come to reshape online media. Such a near-sighted focus on the \"weirdness\" sells Thug short. Of his three major singles this year, each highlighted a distinct facet of his skill set. \"Danny Glover\" was peak zaniness, probing the outer limits of what constitutes catchiness; \"The Blanguage\", in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin, presented Thug as a deft lyricist and effective balladeer. But best of all was \"Stoner\", in which words fell short as descriptors and functioned instead as measurements of rhythm and space. If anything, it made more sense as a grime song than a rap song, with Dun Deal’s spare beat challenging Thug to find new ways to make himself comfortable within it. It struck a precarious balance between restraint and release: an unsure hand could've sent the whole thing toppling. It wasn’t weird—it was masterful. —Meaghan Garvey Young Thug: \"Stoner\" There are qualities about Mike Hadreas that make him seem heroic: His songbook takes on themes of trauma and addiction, the body and identity, all in a way that seems designed to protect us—a reminder that we're not alone in our otherness. This year, Hadreas has been selling T-shirts depicting an emasculated Eminem, a proper jab at one of popular music's most problematic living artists. On the shirt, Slim is clad in coral lipstick, just a few shades lighter than the tint Hadreas wore on his watershed \"Letterman\" performance in October, contorting a slow, sultry sway through \"Queen\". Indeed, Hadreas' work as Perfume Genius has opened a crucial dialogue over the past half decade. Recall the 2012 incident with his 16-second YouTube ad for Put Your Back N 2 It getting censored for \"promoting mature sexual themes\" because it featured two shirtless men hugging. As there's no shortage of topless folks on YouTube, the message from Google was clear: it was the queerness that was unsuitable and—as the corporation wrote in a statement—\"not family safe.\" And so, should you need convincing, the quaking \"Queen\" is empirically necessary. \"No family is safe/ When I sashay,\" Hadreas asserts through expressive breaths on the refrain of the year, channeling personal rage into a surreal energy, addressing gay panic—the idea that one's visible otherness as a gay individual makes people uncomfortable, that it’s perceived as a threat to the straight world. Hadreas sounds just as defiant and poetic in 2014 as Patti Smith did in 1975 telling us how Jesus did not die for her sins. And like Smith's earth-shattering subversions of the female archetype, Hadreas' provocations are confident, uncompromising, epic—he appoints himself \"queen\" and owns the supposed flaws of his sexuality (\"cracked, peeling, riddled with disease\") with a deviant wink and demonic smirk. One would expect music that is both radically politicized and universal from someone who grew up listening to \"a lot of badass feminist music\" and who says he's seen Sleater-Kinney at least 13 times. His words alone have such inspired power—imagine them publicly broadcast on a marquee in LED lighting, like a Jenny Holzer installation—but \"Queen\" does not just illuminate the potential of explicit language. It has few aesthetic precedents, though it pushes the borders of pop and avant-gardism in a way Arthur Russell would have appreciated. The cool drag of a drum contribution from PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish morphed the song into what has been aptly described in interviews as \"stoner glam.\" There is a tornado swirling—a deep, booming low-end; abrasive synths rolling into an ecstatic dreamscape; passing clouds made of soul—and Hadreas is at the eye of the storm, a light steadily beaming from the chaos of the world, stepping into the future. \"Queen\" is a gay anthem, but it also empathizes broadly with all people who biologically have less direct access to the top seats in society. In a year that rendered the world's rampant, widespread injustice so depressingly apparent, what could keep us believing that all this music stuff matters so much? It's songs like \"Queen\" and the sea changes they summon that give it purpose. The future of pop belongs to people like Hadreas, who will take us forward to new places we didn't know we needed to go. Surrounded by this loud, extreme music, it sounds like nothing can hurt him now. —Jenn Pelly Perfume Genius: \"Queen\"",
    "LabBody": "In one of 2014’s quietest revelations, Gainesville quartet Hundred Waters transcended one of pop music’s most shopworn clichés. An upstart group emerged from nowhere in 2012 with a polished, wholly unique debut record, is subsequently chased by every noteworthy major-indie, chooses instead to take Skrillex’s money…and succeeds on all counts. The Moon Rang Like a Bell expands on the promise of their debut album without sacrificing anything about what made it good. They upgrade their IDM faerie-queene origins to the oddball electro/R\u0026B mainstage of FKA twigs, Purity Ring, and How to Dress Well, in other words, but on \"Murmurs\", singer/songwriter Nicole Miglis still manages to sneak in the word \"thee.\" The group sets \"Murmurs\" in the kind of ice palace pioneered by the Cocteau Twins or Homogenic, but Miglis pitches her voice to a pained upper register that Björk or Elisabeth Fraser never went. It’s a breakup song themed around a missed birthday—images of candles and wishes abound—but the production’s combination of churchly solemnity and far-off, slow-motion industrial clamor suggest something much more universal: the consistent drone of modern life co-existing with timeless cycles of loss and rebirth. Above all, though, is the song's devotion to \"thee,\" that constant, all-too-human desire to view experience through someone else’s eyes. —Eric Harvey. Hundred Waters: \"Murmurs\" (via SoundCloud)",

    "DiffbotBody": "With Microsoft making significant layoffs in its phone business this week, it seems to outsiders like an uncharacteristic misstep. How did the tech giant misunderstand the mobile market so badly? As CEO Satya Nadella pulls the company away from unprofitable ventures launched by predecessor Steve Ballmer, it’s worth taking a look at some of the other major blunders that have hit the company. Did you know Microsoft made an MP3 player? Or that Windows Vista’s development was going so badly at one point that they hit the reset button? And that's just the beginning. Nokia With Nokia one of the few companies actually making Windows phones, Microsoft officials were a bit spooked that Nokia might switch platforms and move into the Android camp. Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analysis, explains that Microsoft paid a “strategy tax” by buying Nokia’s devices division in 2013 to make sure the hardware existed to run its software. “Why Microsoft paid over $7 billion for a money-losing business is mind-boggling, but what really hurt was the timing: Microsoft paid the strategy tax after Windows had already lost the mobile platform fight,” Greengart said. Tablet PC Nokia wasn’t the first time Microsoft pushed into the mobile sphere, nor was the iPad the first tablet computer. No, the snappily named Windows XP Tablet PC Edition helped define what Microsoft saw as the future of computing: computers that were more like books, except they had pens and you could touch the screens. The company had eight years between launching the tablet PC and the iPad arriving, and in that time hardware improved, laptops got lighter, and operating systems became more streamlined. None of that mattered in the end. Microsoft had fundamentally misunderstood how people would use tablets, and the iPad set the world alight from the word go. Zune Remember the Zune? If so, you’re one of the few who do. Five years after the iPod came out, Microsoft finally decided it had an answer to Apple’s runaway success. Available at launch in black, white and, er…brown, the Zune had some interesting features like Wi-Fi and a marginally bigger screen to set it apart from the iPod video. None of that mattered, and the launch of the iPhone a few months later did little to help. In 2009, three years after launching, it had a 2 percent share of the market according to NPD. The company finally pulled the plug in June 2012. Ad Tech In 2007, Microsoft decided it was time to jump into another industry it had waited far too long to join. And so it was advertising’s turn, an industry dominated in the online sphere by Google, with Microsoft buying aQuantive in 2007 to make its entry. In 2012, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion write-down on its ad tech investments. In 2013, the company sold Atlas Solutions, part of the aQuantive buyout, to Facebook. The Q4 2014 financial results showed display ads made up 15 percent of total ad revenue, and sure enough last month Microsoft finally pulled the plug. Windows Vista Vista started off life in May 2001 as “Longhorn,” named after a bar at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort. “Whistler” and “Blackcomb” were the codenames for Windows XP and 7, respectively, with “Longhorn” intended as a stopgap release for 2003. Over time, Blackcomb features made their way into Longhorn, and more and more ideas were thrown into the mix. At the same time, Microsoft was doubling down on security updates for XP, pulling resources from Longhorn. In August 2004 it was clear Microsoft had no idea what the plan was, so they started over. Vista finally launched in January 2007, more than five years after XP. It was the longest timespan between releases, cost $6 billion, and was replaced by Windows 7 in around half the time it took Vista to arrive. Windows 8 Unfortunately, the Windows success would soon slip away again. Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows division, was able to implement his vision of how Windows should be. It should work with touchscreen interfaces, kickstart a new app ecosystem and set out bold new ideas. Turns out, enterprise users don’t care about any of that stuff, and consumers don’t want touchscreen controls for their keyboard and mouse.

Yet the county filed a motion to dismiss Manning’s federal lawsuit on grounds that Manning doesn’t truly live in Charleston, S.C., in a silly, non-starting move.

Manning has lived in South Carolina for months and has stated he has no intention moving back. Let’s get on with the suit and stop this obfuscating.

Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: First, stand barefoot and then rise onto your toes repeatedly. Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "LabBody": "There are many solutions to avoiding excess bag charges on flights. You can pack light or you can wear as many articles of clothing you have to avoid superfluous luggage and those pesky, pesky fees. That's what one member of the boyband Rewind did... and then he passed out while doing so. So yes, boybands are still a thing and this one is named Rewind. Don’t feel bad if you’ve never heard of them, you’re not alone.. In any case, the members of the five-piece man ensemble were heading from Essex to Glasgow. One of the boys, 19-year-old James McElvar, wanted to avoid a £45 (that's about $70) charge for having too many bags, so he put on 12 layers of clothing — 12 LAYERS! Is that three pairs of pants in your pocket or are you just happy to see us? \"The woman said either one bag went in the hold or we weren't getting on,” McElvar told The Sun. “The rest of the band had gone through so I couldn't give them any of the clothes. I was told I’d either have to pay a £45 fee to get it on the plane, get the flight the next morning, bin the clothes or wear them.\" Here's the roster of clothing he put on: six T-shirts, five sweaters, three pairs of jeans, two sweat pants, two jackets and two hats. There's nothing sexier than a boyband member in layers and layers of clothing. Eventually, McElvar \"became violently ill and suffered a fit\" with \"an off-duty paramedic treat[ing] him as passengers looked on.” He said that he felt like he was going to have a heart attack. Luckily, he survived and the band Rewind will live on. They made sure to tweet the news to put their fans at ease. So happy that they are safe and sound. Now all the world will not be void of their awesome songs... whatever they are.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A TV show named \"Gunsmoke\" made its debut, and another named \"Make Room for Daddy\" won two Emmys. Elvis Presley and Pat Boone had young hearts all shook up, and for the first time, they could listen to those crooners and others on a new gadget called a pocket transistor radio. A new car cost $1,900, gasoline was 23 cents a gallon and rents averaged $87 a month. It was 1955. On July 17 of that year — a year in which the last occupying troops left Austria and the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series — Disneyland opened its doors. If the first day was any indicator of its future, we might have expected Walt Disney's amusement park to fade into oblivion, much like Georgia Gibbs' No. 1 Billboard hit \"Dance With Me Henry\" did. (Quick, hum a few bars.) The chaos of Disneyland's debut played out in front of a national television audience, and predictions of epic failure abounded. Sixty years later, we know how wrong those naysayers were. With nearly 17 million annual visitors, Disneyland is the biggest draw in California and among the top tourist destinations in the world. The park's drawing power persuaded Disney to build theme parks in Florida, France, Japan and China. Other amusement parks, such as Denmark's Tivoli Gardens, existed, but Disneyland established a modern theme-park template that has been often duplicated but rarely matched. We think we know Disneyland; after all, we've had 60 years to get acquainted. But do we really? Reporters Christopher Reynolds and Brady MacDonald have compiled a list of 60 things you might not know on the diamond anniversary of the theme park that became the gold standard. 1. Much of Disneyland is built to scale to create the illusion of a full-scale experience. The trains circling the park and the Mark Twain Riverboat are built to 5/8 scale. Sleeping Beauty Castle and the storefronts on Main Street, U.S.A., use forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller. 2. More than a million corn dogs are sold annually at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park. L.A. Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold calls the Disneyland corn dog the best he's ever had. 3. The Rivers of America in Frontierland is 4 to 8 feet deep. The first time the man-made river was filled in 1955, the water seeped through the sandy soil. The riverbed was eventually lined with clay to prevent leaking. 4. The Rivers of America held 6.16 million gallons of water the first time it was filled and lost 30,000 gallons a day to evaporation. 5. Maintenance crews dump 12 pounds of green or brown dye into the water a couple of times a week to color the river. 6. The 8- to 15-foot-tall berm that surrounds Disneyland was designed to keep out the real world and keep in the fantasy world. The dirt for the berm came from the excavation of the Rivers of America. Some of the 350,000 cubic yards of excavated dirt was also used to create what would become Tom Sawyer Island. 7. The Disney family crest can be found over the entrance to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The coat of arms was placed above the arch in 1965, about a year before Walt Disney's death. 8. About 84 million Mickey Mouse ears have been sold since 1955. The Mouseketeers first wore the hats in the 1950s on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television show. 9. More than 750 million people have visited Disneyland since opening day. It took just seven weeks for the first million visitors to walk through the gates. Attendance was 3.6 million in 1955-56, its first year of operation. 10. More than 50 scuba divers maintain the water-based attractions and waterways at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. 11. Dream of getting married in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle? You can, but it will set you back $120,000 for an after-hours ceremony. A trip in Cinderella's crystal coach is included, but if you want Mickey and Minnie Mouse to attend, it will cost you an additional $1,425 for a 30-minute visit. 12. Disneyland has a \"jail\" for disruptive guests (Disney-speak for visitors). They're typically held in a security office until Anaheim police arrive. Undercover Disney security officers have been known to watch for shoplifters. 13. No gum is sold at Disney theme parks. Walt Disney didn't want visitors to step in discarded chewing gum. 14. A small lamp remains lighted in the window above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., in memory of Walt Disney. He often stayed overnight in the 500-square-foot apartment during construction of Disneyland. A larger Disney family apartment was later built above New Orleans Square. 15. The apartment above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., includes a dressing area, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a shower. The couches fold out to make additional beds. 16. On opening day, Disneyland contained 800 mostly nonindigenous species of plants from as far away as Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan. 17. More than 12,000 orange trees were removed from the 160-acre plot that became Disneyland. Some of the discarded trees were replanted upside down along the banks of the Jungle Cruise to look like mangrove roots. 18. The route of the Jungle Cruise was laid out with a Jeep outfitted to simulate the length and width of a riverboat. 19. The Mark Twain stern-wheeler, built at a cost of $150,000, was constructed in pieces and assembled at Disneyland. The upper deck was fabricated in Burbank, and the hull was built at a San Pedro shipyard, trucked overnight to the park and lifted by crane into the Rivers of America. 20. Fantasyland's carousel operated at Toronto's Sunnyside Park for decades before being moved to Disneyland in advance of the park's opening. The original carousel featured a menagerie of animals but now has only horses. Additional horses were acquired from other amusement parks. 21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million. 48. In summer 1970, somebody circulated gag fliers proposing a yippie invasion of Disneyland on Aug. 6. On the appointed day, dozens of yippies, or perhaps generic hippies, gathered on Tom Sawyer Island and raised a Viet Cong flag. Management took the rare step of closing the park five hours early, prompting a bold headline (with photos) on the next day's front page of The Times: \"Yippies' Outburst Shuts Disneyland.\" 49. When the park opened, it had both pay and free toilets. Soon after, all bathrooms became free. 50. Walt Disney and author Ray Bradbury were friends. One day at lunch, Bradbury offered to help rebuild Tomorrowland. Disney is said to have replied: \"Ray, it's no use … you're a genius and I'm a genius … after two weeks we'd kill each other!\" Later, Bradbury called it \"the nicest turndown I've ever had.\" 51. By the time It's a Small World opened at Disneyland in 1966, it had already been seen by more than 10 million visitors during its two years at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. 52. Walt Disney had a lot of input into Pirates of the Caribbean, but he died in December 1966, about four months before the ride opened. 53. In 1971, stage psychic the Amazing Criswell predicted that by 1999, Disneyland would be covered by a plastic bubble, its weather controlled by a switch. 54. Though Walt Disney sported a mustache for most of his adult life, Disneyland banned facial hair on its workers from 1957 until 2000, when restrictions were eased. 55. If Disneyland's original $1 adult admission fee had increased in lockstep with the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, today it would be $8.87. Instead, it's $99. (But in the old days, you had to buy ride tickets separately. Now they're included.) 56. In September 1959, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a historic visit to Los Angeles and asked to see Disneyland. His minders first said yes, and then no, after Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker said he couldn't guarantee Khrushchev's safety. \"Why not?\" Khrushchev protested at a public luncheon. \"What is it? Do you have rocket-launching pads there? ... Is there an epidemic of cholera there? … Have gangsters taken hold of the place?\" 57. In Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the Toad Hall library includes these titles: \"For Whom the Toads Croak\" and \"A Tadpole Grows in Brooklyn.\" 58. When it opened in June 1959, Disneyland's monorail was the first daily operating monorail in the Western Hemisphere. 59. Sleeping Beauty Castle is 77 feet tall. Neuschwanstein, the 19th century Bavarian castle that's widely credited as its inspiration, is 213 feet high. (Neuschwanstein, about 80 miles southwest of Munich, Germany, gets 1.4 million visitors yearly.) 60. For height reasons, there's a good chance Mickey Mouse and many other costumed characters are played by female cast members. Male cast members portray the taller characters such as Goofy and Sheriff Woody. Princess characters have strict height requirements: They must be 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall.

There is a also nod to the signature Truckster, which in this version becomes the tricked-out \"Tartan Prancer,\" a kind of James Bond car of misfortune.

Incidentally, his character's bullying--by his younger brother--is another 2015 spin, bringing into the modern era the inter-gender squabbling of the original.) Still, this is an R-rated New Line comedy more than a Phil Lord-Chris Miller postmodern jazz riff. Cow collisions and accidental cesspool dunkings figure prominently. The new \"Vacation\" boasts big set pieces, as in the rafting scene, and lots of red-band humor, via a misunderstanding between father and son over an explicit sex act and a motel stay featuring unexpected bathroom substances. Some of the movie’s broadest moments take place during a detour to the home of Audrey and her comically beefcake husband Stone (Chris Hemsworth, in a rare comedic performance). Stone is an alpha type who gets some of the bigger laughs thanks to—how to put this--a strategically placed prosthetic, awakening fresh questions in Rusty about how his wife regards him. Goldstein and Daley initially wrote \"Vacation\" as a PG-13 script; this was, after all, about a family. But at the time a few comedies with the softer rating had failed, while R-rated comedies were hot. Executives went back to the writers for an R-rated pass. The result is one of the few movies about everyday parents and kids that the former might not want the latter to see. (The 1983 film was an R too but a soft one, and it came out before the creation of the PG-13.) Perhaps the biggest deviation from the original lies in the lead character. Helms offers a different kind of patriarch than Chase — less the smirky schemer and more the sweetheart schlemiel. \"I may be a little similar to Rusty in my own life,\" Helms said. \"I'm the goofy optimist who thinks things can always work out.\" Of the actor’s appeal, Goldstein noted, “There’s a blend of innocence and likability that allows you to empathize with him even when he makes his own problems.” On cue, after shooting wrapped for the day, Helms decided to join a little kayaking expedition. He donned a suit and nose strips and jumped with his vessel into a rushing stream. The kayak promptly capsized, disappearing its pilot and eliciting a momentary where’s-Ed moment of panic among the land-bound crew. 'Fresh' but respectful' Sequels to classic movies bring out the naysayers and the timeline scrutinizers — just ask anyone who worked on \"Terminator Genisys.\" Some \"Vacation\" fans are understandably wary of a movie that invokes the Griswold name but follows the conventions of the modern summer sequel. Chris Bender, a \"Vacation\" producer, noted that \"what we needed to do was be fresh but also respectful. Which was terrifying.\" Indeed, the film's lineage can be its biggest selling point, but also its greatest obstacle. \"Wouldn't it have been funnier if they did something different, like Rusty and Audrey each had families with kids, and they dropped them off with Clark and Ellen, who had to take care of them as grandparents?\" said Barron, the original Audrey, in an interview. \"This just feels like it's repeating the idea of the first movie.\" (That idea has prompted some, including Barron and D'Angelo, to say they think of this as a remake, though New Line and the filmmakers regard it as a sequel.) Barron, who did not appear in the theatrical sequels, expressed frustration she and Hall weren't contacted for roles in the new film. \"It's a little odd that they're moving on like this, saying they're going back to the original but not including the original Audrey or original Rusty,\" the actress said, in comments that highlight the tricky task of updating a classic. Still, the appearance of Chase and D'Angelo will offer continuity to the original, even if their roles are small enough that, as D'Angelo quipped, \"I think I'm the highest paid actress, by line, of anyone in Hollywood this year.\" The rules of narrative have also changed since 1983. The enjoyable slackness of the first film — plot lines digress to nowhere; consequences are non-existent — doesn't really work in today's more structured storytelling world. The filmmakers acknowledge they kept tighter screws on the story than the original, especially in its last act. The new movie also comes at a moment when the idea of an American vacation is changing. A recent 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll found that two-thirds of Americans would gladly trade vacation days for more money, and nearly 70% of Americans under 30 saw checking emails when not at work a reasonable requirement — an attitude that might make the idea of a fancy-free road trip play a little less convincingly than it did 30 years ago. Every generation gets the new version of a classic it deserves, as has often been said of Shakespeare and, lately, “Spider-Man.” The original \"Vacation,\" made by filmmakers who came of age in the '60s and set in a taboo-busting era, had a kind of nihilism about the traditional family. The new movie, made by filmmakers who came of age with Oprah and set in the family-values era, has greater concern for the preservation of a marriage. In that way, \"Vacation\" may be subject to a criticism about today's R-rated comedies: for all their gross-out humor, they are actually culturally less subversive than their predecessors. The filmmakers say it's a label they're happy to wear. \"There are inherently emotions that are going on in a road trip. The original was about undermining those emotions and sentimentality, and even the family unit,\" Goldstein said. \"Our movie is a little different. We didn't want to shy away from making a movie about a marriage that's not where it should be and someone setting out to fix it.\" Added Daley, \"What's changed since the comedies of the '80s is that audiences do appreciate when there's a sweetness and a relatability.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Correction: The population of the city of Oregon was changed to reflect the correct population total according to the 2010 U.S. Census. OREGON — A statue of a young black boy wearing a butler-like uniform and carrying a lantern is stirring controversy in this Ogle County community. But as the nation grapples again with racism in the wake of the killing of nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, it doesn't appear that the symbol that some consider racist will be removed from Jim Barnes' lawn any time soon. “I’m offended personally and embarrassed as the mayor of the city,\" Mayor Ken Williams said, not mincing words when asked his thoughts on the statue. Similar statues have sat on many U.S. lawns through the years. But Williams wants this one taken down. “I’m embarrassed we have it in our city,” he said. “I don’t see any place for it.” Williams is also concerned about how the symbol will affect his business. He owns the Pinehill Inn Bed \u0026 Breakfast, which is just a few doors down from Barnes’ house. Williams worries that some of his guests may find the statue offensive and go elsewhere for lodging. Despite his objections, Williams has never asked Barnes to remove the statue. Williams consulted an attorney, who advised that the mayor has no jurisdiction on Barnes’ private property. Barnes, the city's commissioner of public property, was mayor from 1975 through 1999. He said nobody has spoken to him directly about the statue, although he did receive an anonymous letter about 20 years ago asking him to “paint the statue’s face white\" so it would not offend blacks. Barnes said he ignores anonymous notes. Cute, not cute. Besides, as Barnes tells it, he probably wouldn’t remove it anyway: “It might be offensive to them, but not to me and not to most people.” He bought the statue nearly 30 years ago at a store in Chicago. “I just thought it was cute.” “We need to understand what this is, it’s not a cute image,” said LaVerne Gyant, director for the Center for Black Studies at Northern Illinois University. “It is perpetuating an image or stereotype of African-Americans.” Barnes hasn’t researched the lawn ornament’s history. However, a magazine salesman tried to explain the significance of the statue one afternoon many years ago, but Barnes wasn’t interested. “To my thinking, it does not represent slavery,” Barnes said. Gyant said that’s not exactly correct. Through the years, the statue morphed from a young man in tattered clothing to one in a house servant’s attire with a horse jockey’s cap. Barnes’ statue features the latter. The statue also was used during the Civil War to indicate whether a house was a safe or dangerous stop on the Underground Railroad. A red ribbon was a warning, a green ribbon represented safety. Teaching tool. No matter what clothing or ribbon is featured on the statue, Gyant says, the young man was a slave: “All of them were enslaved. They were not free young boys, which means they were working for somebody white.” Gyant, who is black, said the statue would be OK to display in Barnes' yard if he used it as an educational tool. She said African-American organizations encourage black residents to “buy up” the statues and similar items in order to educate others on its historical significance. “Conversation can be held about these images so that people can understand. I use similar items in my teachings to explain some of the stereotypes, but some white people don’t want to understand the significance behind them.” Gyant said conversation is important in communities like Oregon, where the black community is small — less than 1 percent of the population of around 3,700 — and may not be as active as in larger communities with more significant African-American populations. Barnes and Williams are white. The statue’s image may be heightened because of the debate over the Confederate flag, which came to a head after the church shooting in Charleston. The gunman, Dylann Storm, posed in photographs with the flag before the attack. Gyant cautions against comparing the “Faithful Groomsman” with the Confederate flag. “The Confederate flag is an open symbol of white supremacy,” she said firmly. Barnes said the flag is different as well, but he stands by his right to display those items on his property. A city rep. Williams said Barnes is missing the point: Barnes has a right to express his feelings, but as a commissioner of the city, he must be held to a higher standard. “Some things are just personally offensive,” Williams said. “As a commissioner, you now have a responsibility to represent and be a role model for all residents.” Barnes disagrees. “I’ve always felt that as a political figure I had to be above reproach. But I don’t see this as being negative to anybody. I think someone is just nitpicking on one item.” Barnes says he will listen to any concerns people may have. “I’ll listen to you, but I may not agree with you,” he said. “Come talk to me face to face.” Maggie Hradecky: 815-987-1367; mhradecky@rrstar.com; @maggiehrad.",

Gyant said that’s not exactly correct. Page 2 of 3. - According to legend, the statue represents a 12-year-old African-American boy named Jocko Graves, who wanted to fight the Redcoats during the Revolutionary War. Gen. George Washington felt Jocko was too young. He ordered the boy to look after the horses and keep a lantern blazing along the Delaware River so Washington’s company would know where to return after a surprise attack on the British forces in Trenton. New Jersey. Jocko stood steadfast but froze to death, clenching the lantern. Touched by Jocko’s devotion to the cause, Washington commissioned the statue, “Faithful Groomsman,” which would be placed at the general’s estate at Mount Vernon.

    "DiffbotBody": "Same-sex couples will now be eligible for federal marriage benefits, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced Thursday. “I am proud to announce that the critical programs for veterans and elderly and disabled Americans, which previously could not give effect to the marriages of couples living in states that did not recognize those marriages, will now provide federal recognition for all marriages nationwide,” Lynch said in a statement. The Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 ruling last month that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and that all states must grant gay and lesbian couples marriage licenses. Before the ruling, 13 states did not recognize same-sex marriage. Many federal marriage benefits were available to same-sex couples after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal ban on gay marriage. Some benefits, though, including Social Security and veterans benefits for spouses, were still unavailable to these couples if they lived in states that did not recognize their marriages. “With the Supreme Court’s new ruling that the Constitution requires marriage equality, we have now taken the further step of ensuring that all federal benefits will be available equally to married couples in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories,” Lynch said. The Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs said they were still working to implement the ruling, with the Social Security Administration issuing a statement that same-sex couples should apply for benefits right away, if they believe they qualify. The VA said that it will be issuing new guidance shortly, but in the meantime it will temporarily wait to rule on claims that were not covered previous to the Supreme Court ruling. Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney for Gay \u0026 Lesbian Advocates \u0026 Defenders, a legal advocacy group, told AP that there are still questions to be resolved regarding the implementation of the ruling. Issues of couples needing to re-apply if they had already been denied benefits have been raised. \"With this terrific statement from the attorney general, the devil is in the details,\" Henry said. \"Marriage benefits are available to same-sex couples nationwide, and that's as it should be. I think that is what the Supreme Court ruling requires. But what does that mean?\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Which is right: preventive or preventative? That’s the kind of question I get all the time, and these queries always make me smile. They’re based on assumptions that, after 13 years of writing about grammar, strike me as quaint bordering on adorable. The main assumption is that one form must be right and the other wrong — painting a rosy picture of a black-and-white world where any choice, from political party to mustard-vs.-mayonnaise, has a single, knowable, correct answer. Adorable. But a question like “Preventive or preventative?” contains yet another assumption, this one perhaps even more precious: the belief that there’s some wise someone out there calling the shots and laying down the rules. Au contraire. When you learn your way around the language and get to know the authorities who write the rule books, you discover that these nameless, faceless icons of wisdom and judgment are no better than anyone else at getting their act together. Open up Garner’s Modern American Usage, turn to the entry on “preventative” and you’ll see this: “The strictly correct form is ‘preventive’ (as both noun and adjective), though the corrupt form with the extra internal syllable is unfortunately common. ... In modern print sources, ‘preventive’ is about five times as common as ‘preventative,’ a needless variant.” Sounds good, right? A clear answer. A little contextual perspective. Some sense of proportion via the word “strictly.” If you didn’t know better, you would just take this as an answer and be on your merry way. But if you did know better, you’d check a second usage guide, say, Merriam Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage. Here’s what you’d find: “The critics have panned ‘preventative’ for over a century, preferring its shorter synonym ‘preventive’ in spite of the fact that both words have been around for over 300 years and both have had regular use by reputable writers. Here is the basic premise behind the objections: if two similar adjectives are derived from the same verb, then one of them must be in some way inferior to the other, and the likely culprit is the longer one. But the only real difference in status between these two words is that ‘preventative’ is much less common than ‘preventive.’” Our first source says that “preventive” is correct. The second says that the first guy, along with anyone else who has a horse in this race, is wrong. That’s the kind of guidance that leaves you in need of more guidance. So where else might you turn? Why, the dictionary, of course. There’s just one problem. There is no “the” dictionary. In fact, there’s not even a “Webster’s dictionary.” The name Webster is controlled by no one. It’s used by multiple publishers in the titles of multiple competing dictionaries that often contradict each other. The two dictionaries most used by news media, book and magazine publishers demonstrate this. AP style, used by newspapers, defers to Webster’s New World College Dictionary for matters not covered in the style guide. Chicago style, used by book publishers, uses Merriam Webster’s Collegiate. These two dictionaries disagree on a lot of matters. They do, however, agree on “preventative” — sort of. Webster’s New World says that “preventative” is a “variant” of “preventive.” Merriam Webster’s has a different way of discounting “preventative”: It lists its definition as simply “preventive.” If you want more than that, you have to consult the entry for the shorter word. The subtext is that both dictionaries consider “preventive” the standard form, as established by centuries of usage. That means that “preventive” is better if you value opinions like these. But if you don’t, the longer form is also acceptable. JUNE CASAGRANDE is the author of “The Best Punctuation Book, Period.” She can be reached at JuneTCN@aol.com.",

Volunteers from ConsignWorks, a company that hosts estate sales, recently visited the home of Rebekah Honer Doran and her husband, Peter Doran, to help them prepare for a sale of their home goods on July 11. Employees from the company donated their time and effort after learning of Peter Doran's battle with Stage IV brain cancer. The Dorans bought their house at 25 Fairmount Street around 10 years ago. The couple met while working together in the sales department at Monster.com and wed several years later. Their family has grown to include four children. Located in the Fairmount Hill neighborhood, the house dates to the 1890s. It survived the period when other historical homes in the area were torn down to make way for Granger Boulevard. While they loved the home, the Dorans soon found it inconvenient to live there after Peter was diagnosed in August 2012 with a large brain tumor. At the time, the tumor was not considered cancerous, but the tumor was surgically removed and Peter went on chemotherapy as a precaution. He had surgery again in April 2014 after testing revealed an irregular growth in the same area. In the weeks that followed, Peter underwent 30 rounds of radiation and was treated with a new drug under development during visits to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Peter's health seemed to improve, but he began experiencing nausea and problems balancing in April. An MRI revealed a tumor had formed in his brain stem. He is now making biweekly trips to Dana-Farber for treatment to help ameliorate some of the symptoms. As the illness progressed, and as their children grew older, the couple looked to move into a smaller house. Stairs became a challenge, and the only working shower in their three-story Victorian was located in the top floor. \"It was a lot for me because I'm doing everything,\" Honer Doran said. \"I'm working full time. I'm taking care of the kids and taking care of my husband, bringing him to all of his treatments, remembering medicine, all that other stuff, and then having to deal with the maintenance of this house.\" They moved into a smaller home and now must sell some of their possessions, including a collection of antique furniture and other specialty items they picked up over the years from consignment shops and antique fairs like the Brimfield Flea Market. Rebekah contemplated organizing an estate sale on her own, but with limited time and resources, she was overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. Her friend, Lisa Ragan, tapped the resources of her employer, ConsignWorks, to help organize a consignment sale for the family at no charge. The sale takes place from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on July 11.

    "LabBody": "RACINE COUNTY — Darlene Burchell used to watch house and car fires on the news with her husband, Larry, at their Yorkville house, always hoping aloud that they would never die like that, fearing the pain of a fire. Her fears became reality when Larry Burchell died after his truck started on fire after a crash on May 24. “You talk about all that stuff, and then I’ll be darned, it happens,” said Darlene Burchell, Larry’s wife of 51 years. Larry Burchell’s death is one of the 13 motor vehicle fatalities that have struck the county so far this year. After three motor vehicle fatalities happened in five days last week, the vehicle-related deaths so far in 2015 surpassed Racine County’s average of 12 vehicle fatalities per year over the previous five years. “This was just, as medical examiner, the first time I’ve experienced this many fatalities in this short amount of time that involved motor vehicles or motorcycles,” said Racine County Medical Examiner Michael Payne. On June 21, Father’s Day, two fathers lost their lives in a Downtown crash. Then, a collision between a semi-truck and motorcyclist on Thursday, killing Maximiliano Penaloza Ferreira, 20, of Racine, pushed the county above the average. That collision also adds to what Payne calls a “disturbing” number of motorcyclist fatalities this year. Above average. The average number of motor vehicle deaths the county experienced throughout a year is 12, based on Wisconsin Department of Transportation data from 2010-2014. With a half year left, Racine County could surpass the 14 motor vehicle deaths that happened throughout 2014. Payne said he was concerned by the number of motor vehicle deaths in the past six months, citing the weather and upcoming holidays as possibilities for collisions. Motorcyclists will still take to the roads for the three remaining months of good weather, Payne said, and then snow and ice will offer different traffic hazards. “I guess I have to be the pessimist here,” Payne said. “I would expect those numbers to go up before the end of the year, unfortunately.” Capt. Thomas Lamke of the Racine County Sheriff’s Office said the year’s statistics so far stand out because it follows a year of few fatalities statewide. “Even the low number we had last year, (fatalities) are concerning especially if they’re things that are preventable,” said Lamke, who also serves on the county’s Traffic Safety Commission. As of June 21, the entire state had seen 239 fatalities, compared to the 188 fatalities that occurred by June 21, 2014. This year’s year-to-date accident report outnumbers Wisconsin’s five-year average by 20, according to Wisconsin Department of Transportation data. Motorcycle deaths. The first nice spring day was tainted for Payne when he heard about the first motorcycle accident of the year. Riders take to the road when the weather is mild, so motorcycle incidents occur more frequently in those months, Payne said. “I remember walking up to my house and thinking ‘Wow, what a beautiful day,’ and a couple hours later I got called to my office,” Payne said. At five fatalities, motorcycle crashes nearly outnumbered all other types of vehicle crashes, including car and truck collisions, Payne said. In comparison, there were three motorcycle deaths in the county last year, Payne said. In addition, this year there was a fatal accident involving an ATV. This year, the county also saw five deaths related to cars and trucks, and two pedestrian deaths from one incident, according to Payne’s fatality data. Head injuries are a major source of vehicle-related deaths, especially among motorcyclists, Payne said. Even with a helmet, motorcyclists have no way of protecting their necks, and a spinal cord injury can result in death. “The same type of fender-bender that someone in a car could walk away from can be fatal to a motorcyclist,” Payne said. Seeking common factors. Adverse weather can also cause fatal accidents. Heavy snow and ice contributed to two deaths that occurred in January, he said. Fatal accidents in the county appear to occur just as frequently on rural roads as they do on urban roads, Payne said. The county’s Traffic Safety Commission evaluates the county’s fatal crashes four times a year to see if there are similarities in crash sites or circumstances. Occasionally the commission will change road rules, or it will come up with ideas for public-safety campaigns. A majority of the deaths to motorcyclists this year occurred after a driver in a larger vehicle made a left turn and collided with a motorcycle, according to Payne. Because motorcycles are harder to see and afford less protection to their riders, Payne said he hopes drivers and motorcyclists exercise more caution on the roads. “Especially with a motorcycle, it’s a smaller object, it’s not like a car grill with two headlights coming at you,” Payne said. The Traffic Safety Commission also is concerned about drivers taking their eyes away from the road, due to use of cellphones and GPS behind the wheel. Distracted driving is a major concern for Darlene Burchell, after her husband died from a collision reportedly involving an inattentive driver who fell asleep. Burchell’s dog has stopped waiting for her playmate, Larry, to toss the ball to her. “People have been warned over and over and over again ... they just don’t think they’re ever going to kill anybody.”",

Martindale will recur as Willa Eastman, who's successfully championed underdog presidential candidates in Iowa and who \"hides her intelligence and cunning under a fake, folksy charm,\" according to CBS. Lest we forget, in the Season 6 finale, Peter (Chris Noth) told Alicia (Julianna Margulies) that he's been asked to run for president to be a viable VP candidate. So, will Willa be on Team Florrick or a rival's? \"Every year we look for a character and an actor who can go toe-to-toe with Eli Gold and make him blink,\" showrunners Robert and Michelle King said in a statement. \"So we were thrilled when Margo Martindale agreed to play Willa Eastman. Her ability to mix comedy and drama is unparalleled. And we can't wait to see how Margo and Alan deal with each other.\" Martindale previously recurred on The Americans, but left the show due to scheduling conflicts when she landed a role on The Millers. (She returned for one episode last season after The Millers was abruptly canceled.) Martindale also won an Emmy for playing Mags Bennett on Justified. As previously announced, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is coming aboard as a series regular and Cush Jumbo has also landed a recurring role.

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

    "DiffbotBody": "Why is it that some people achieve so much more than others? Are they blessed with \"golden child\" genes or is it something more common than that? Everyone wants to know the secret to success. Hundreds of authors have written books on their idea of what the secret is, and millions have purchased those books looking for the answer. However, many people look at the big successes of people but don't really delve into the little successes and actions that got them there. Benjamin Franklin wrote out and planned every hour of his day from waking up and bathing to \"putting things in order.\" It is the daily actions of successful people, the little things that most people overlook, that get them to the top. The good news is that these habits can be encouraged at an early age. Many successful people are creatures of habit when it comes to how they plan their day, and the choices they make with their time makes all the difference in the level of success they achieve. If you aspire for a more productive day and desire a higher level of opportunties for your children in their lives, here are five habits many successful people do on a daily basis. 1. Have a morning routine This seems like a tedious and minuscule aspect of someone's day, but the truth is, a morning routine has a positive effect on your day. That feeling encourages you to cross something off your list and leaves you feeling accomplished. The purpose of your routine should be to prepare for the day as well as to get started on accomplishing tasks. Not everything you do will be something you enjoy, but you can mix it up with things that get the dopamine flowing, like having your favorite muffin for breakfast. By adapting a morning routine for your children, they have an opportunity to mentally prepare for the demands of the day. An organized morning eliminates misplaced homework, wasted time chasing down a lost shoe, and allows your child time to concentrate on the demands of the day. 2. Have a to-do list Many people overlook the value of having a to-do list. Yet, it provides a localized place where everything you need to do is written down. One of the simple pleasures of the day is being able to cross off a task when completed. By keeping up with your list, you tend to automatically fall into a mode of productivity, which keeps running throughout the day. Put the things you absolutely need to accomplish at the top, followed by the things you need to complete soon, ending with the things that do not have a close deadline. But start the list with something easy to complete, giving yourself a little dose of accomplishment that gets you a head start on your list. Many schools now encourage the use of a daily planner for their students to keep track of upcoming assignments and test schedules. By utilizing a to-do list, and reviewing it regularly, your child won't be caught unprepared for an upcoming midterm or research paper. 3. Do the things you hate first \"Do your chores, then you can play with your friends.\" This childhood motto still holds true for adults. Try getting the tedious and most disliked tasks out of the way. You'll feel the weight come off your shoulders, and you will be able to enjoy the tasks you like even more when you know you don't have the unpleasant ones hanging over your head. On top of that, the day will seem to go by much faster after you've eliminated the not-so-fun tasks. 4. Focus on the positives So often in life we are prepared to perform our best, yet things don't go our way. Despite our efforts, we still took second in debate, we didn't make the basketball team, we didn't get accepted to the school of our choice. Life is filled with disappointments and setbacks. If you focus on the things you are good at and the positive aspects of the day it will alter your mood to reflect your positive thinking, and things will begin to change. An important lesson for your children is to realize that life will require a need to adapt. Yet, you can continue forward by focusing on the successes you have had. Don't let negativity consume your thinking. Remember, a ship (you) can be sunk by a single puncture if it continues to let in more water (negativity). 5. Visualize Jack Nicklaus is often referred to as the greatest golfer of all time. Throughout a 25-year professional career that included winning 18 major golf championships, Nicklaus practiced visualization with every shot. He mentally played the hole before he ever picked up his club to swing. \"Sometimes the biggest problem is in your head. You've got to believe you can play a shot instead of wondering where your next bad shot is coming from,\" he said. Envisioning your success is vital. It enables you to focus on your goals and get your mind thinking positively. \"The man who thinks he can, and the man who thinks he can't, are both usually right.\" Athletes in all sports are instructed to visualize their next at-bat or their next goal because it truly does have a significant effect on the outcome. For many of us, the pathway to success may seem out of reach or reserved for those of extraordinary talent. But history is filled with extraordinary leaders whose beginnings were less than ideal. By incorporating a morning routine, organizing tasks, focusing on our abilities and keeping a clear vision in mind of what we hope to accomplish, we can enjoy a life filled with productivity, achievement and success.

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project. At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited.

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

    "DiffbotBody": "Editor’s note: This is the first in a two-part series about proposed changes to Harvard Square. Next week, the Chronicle will report on a proposal to revamp Out of Town News. The iconic Harvard Square Forbes Plaza is known for its large outdoor seating area, where street performers and chess aficionados gather around built-in chessboards. But a recent Harvard University proposal to renovate parts of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center, formally known as the Holyoke Center, would eliminate approximately 20 percent of the existing beloved outdoor space at Forbes Plaza — much of the well-known al fresco dining area at Au Bon Pain, across the street from the MBTA Red Line T station on Massachusetts Avenue. The proposal, which received a certificate of appropriateness from the Cambridge Historical Commission, favorable recommendation from the Planning Board and support from the Harvard Square Advisory Committee, is before the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) for height and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) variances and a zoning relief for alteration and expansion of a nonconforming building. Harvard representatives say the goal of the project is to foster greater public engagement — not just outdoors but also indoors with enhanced retail space, improved wheelchair access on the plaza, increased interior landscaping, and seven additional trees planted outside. Some residents, however, feel Forbes Plaza, a landmark enjoyed by the community, would no longer be a place that draws people together. “We may as well rename Harvard Square Harvard’s Square. Harvard doesn’t need anymore glittering window-dressing or programmatic spaces,” Thompson E. Potter Jr., a Martin Street resident, said at a BZA hearing on Thursday, June 25. “Forbes Plaza belongs to a community far wider and far more diverse than Harvard real estate, Harvard Square Business Association and Harvard Board of Overseers.” The BZA has received 16 letters in favor of the Smith Center project and two opposing it. Some residents say Harvard is proposing to take far too much of the existing Forbes Plaza, while others feel the project would provide much needed improvements, potentially turning the center into the heart of the university. “That space currently is extremely underutilized and the renovation project as proposed has the potential to unlock that potential as more than just a building,” said Kevin Tian, a graduate student at Harvard University. “I want to see Harvard Square become that much more lively of a place with that much more energy, and I see this campus center as having that potential.” The project includes renovations on the first, second and 10th floors of the Smith Campus Center, which was designed by Josep Lluis Sert and is currently approximately 328,000 square feet. Harvard has proposed to demolish approximately 13,600 square feet and add a net new floor area of about 7,500 square feet. And the building’s height in an area of the 10th floor would increase from 112 feet to 116 feet. Tanya Iatridis, senior director of university planning for Harvard, said the project would enrich the visitor experience and include a two-level café, indoor and outdoor seating and gathering areas, an information desk, indoor and outdoor chess playing, Harvard events information and ticketing services, and public restrooms. The proposal is one in a series of initiatives in Harvard Square, including Harvard University’s transformation of the Science Plaza as an outdoor gathering space and the addition of seating in Harvard Yard. Prior to that, Cambridge took a renewed look at the square in the mid-1990s and in 1998 the Harvard Square Business Association instituted its first business improvement district, an area where resident businesses pay an extra fee to fund cleanup and beautification efforts. In 2006, the city launched the “Healthy Harvard Square Initiative” that examined the composition of commercial properties in the square. BZA members feel the proposed project includes improvements in public access and use on Dunster, Holyoke and Mt. Auburn streets. But they say Harvard has not clearly indicated the building’s operating hours and how the university plans to inform the community that the center would be open to the public. “The issue is Forbes Plaza and the public use of Forbes Plaza, also whether or not the quality of the enclosed public space is equivalent to the quality of the open public space,” BZA member Douglas Myers said. “The public has to be assured in a qualitative sense that the public enclosed space is somehow the equivalent of the open space. That’s what Harvard has to do before we can justify taking away 20 percent plus of the open space at Forbes Plaza, which is the heart, the essence of Sert’s contribution to the public.” Myers, who raised concerns about the demolition of space in Forbes Plaza, and member Brendan Sullivan, who felt hung up on Harvard’s reluctance to specify exact public-access hours, requested that the university provide a statement of principles about those hours, signage, regulations and enforcement. “So much is being done to accomplish your objectives in other areas that I fail to see why the plan cannot be modified specifically regarding the façade and the fronting and the elevation that are on the reduction of Forbes Plaza so as to preserve the public space in Forbes Plaza,” Myers said. According to Councilor Nadeem Mazen, community benefit and accessibility should be the project’s priority.

    "LabBody": "Editor’s note: This is the first in a two-part series about proposed changes to Harvard Square. Next week, the Chronicle will report on a proposal to revamp Out of Town News. The iconic Harvard Square Forbes Plaza is known for its large outdoor seating area, where street performers and chess aficionados gather around built-in chessboards. But a recent Harvard University proposal to renovate parts of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center, formally known as the Holyoke Center, would eliminate approximately 20 percent of the existing beloved outdoor space at Forbes Plaza — much of the well-known al fresco dining area at Au Bon Pain, across the street from the MBTA Red Line T station on Massachusetts Avenue. The proposal, which received a certificate of appropriateness from the Cambridge Historical Commission, favorable recommendation from the Planning Board and support from the Harvard Square Advisory Committee, is before the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) for height and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) variances and a zoning relief for alteration and expansion of a nonconforming building. Harvard representatives say the goal of the project is to foster greater public engagement — not just outdoors but also indoors with enhanced retail space, improved wheelchair access on the plaza, increased interior landscaping, and seven additional trees planted outside. Some residents, however, feel Forbes Plaza, a landmark enjoyed by the community, would no longer be a place that draws people together. “We may as well rename Harvard Square Harvard’s Square. Harvard doesn’t need anymore glittering window-dressing or programmatic spaces,” Thompson E. Potter Jr., a Martin Street resident, said at a BZA hearing on Thursday, June 25. “Forbes Plaza belongs to a community far wider and far more diverse than Harvard real estate, Harvard Square Business Association and Harvard Board of Overseers.” The BZA has received 16 letters in favor of the Smith Center project and two opposing it. Some residents say Harvard is proposing to take far too much of the existing Forbes Plaza, while others feel the project would provide much needed improvements, potentially turning the center into the heart of the university. “That space currently is extremely underutilized and the renovation project as proposed has the potential to unlock that potential as more than just a building,” said Kevin Tian, a graduate student at Harvard University. “I want to see Harvard Square become that much more lively of a place with that much more energy, and I see this campus center as having that potential.” The project includes renovations on the first, second and 10th floors of the Smith Campus Center, which was designed by Josep Lluis Sert and is currently approximately 328,000 square feet. Harvard has proposed to demolish approximately 13,600 square feet and add a net new floor area of about 7,500 square feet. And the building’s height in an area of the 10th floor would increase from 112 feet to 116 feet. Page 2 of 3. - Food retail space would be located on the first and second floors and include street-facing venues. A dedicated arts space and wellness center reserved for Harvard affiliates would be relocated from its current location in the arcade to the south wing of the second floor. Tanya Iatridis, senior director of university planning for Harvard, said the project would enrich the visitor experience and include a two-level café, indoor and outdoor seating and gathering areas, an information desk, indoor and outdoor chess playing, Harvard events information and ticketing services, and public restrooms. The proposal is one in a series of initiatives in Harvard Square, including Harvard University’s transformation of the Science Plaza as an outdoor gathering space and the addition of seating in Harvard Yard. Prior to that, Cambridge took a renewed look at the square in the mid-1990s and in 1998 the Harvard Square Business Association instituted its first business improvement district, an area where resident businesses pay an extra fee to fund cleanup and beautification efforts. In 2006, the city launched the “Healthy Harvard Square Initiative” that examined the composition of commercial properties in the square. BZA members feel the proposed project includes improvements in public access and use on Dunster, Holyoke and Mt. Auburn streets. But they say Harvard has not clearly indicated the building’s operating hours and how the university plans to inform the community that the center would be open to the public. “The issue is Forbes Plaza and the public use of Forbes Plaza, also whether or not the quality of the enclosed public space is equivalent to the quality of the open public space,” BZA member Douglas Myers said. “The public has to be assured in a qualitative sense that the public enclosed space is somehow the equivalent of the open space. That’s what Harvard has to do before we can justify taking away 20 percent plus of the open space at Forbes Plaza, which is the heart, the essence of Sert’s contribution to the public.” Myers, who raised concerns about the demolition of space in Forbes Plaza, and member Brendan Sullivan, who felt hung up on Harvard’s reluctance to specify exact public-access hours, requested that the university provide a statement of principles about those hours, signage, regulations and enforcement. “So much is being done to accomplish your objectives in other areas that I fail to see why the plan cannot be modified specifically regarding the façade and the fronting and the elevation that are on the reduction of Forbes Plaza so as to preserve the public space in Forbes Plaza,” Myers said. According to Councilor Nadeem Mazen, community benefit and accessibility should be the project’s priority. Taking open public space away will fundamentally change the character of the square and reduce the community’s benefit, he said. Page 3 of 3. - “My hope is that we can get the best of both worlds: make it more beautiful, more up to date, you can even make it better in terms of accessibility and a whole host of other things, but it has to be with the promise that it will be open to the public the way it is now,” Mazen told Harvard representatives. Presently, the arcade is open to the public from 7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Iatridis said Harvard intends to keep similar hours of operation. Harvard representatives are due before the BZA on July 30 and are expected to present their plan for signage as well as the terms and restrictions of public use.

    "LabBody": "After clinching the five-match ODI series 3-2, a confident-looking Indian women’s team will take on New Zealand in the first of the three T20 Internationals here at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.The hosts have the momentum on their side after scripting a great comeback when the chips were down in the one-dayers. In their previous T20I outing in Bengaluru, India had snatched a 16-run victory against South Africa in November last year. Indian spinners, barring one bad game, succeeded to trouble the New Zealand batting with some tight and economical bowling performance. In the pace department, Jhulan Goswami, the women’s No 1 ranked bowler in the world, has done well so far by not being expensive early on in the innings.However, Indian batters will face a challenging task to score at a brisk pace against a competitive New Zealand bowling attack. The hosts will bank on the dashing left-handed opener Smriti Mandhana and skipper Mithali Raj to come good for them with their explosive batting.In their biggest assignment last year, the 2014 Women’s World T20 held in Bangladesh, India had crashed out in the group stage, with two wins and two defeats. The White Ferns boast of some big hitters in their line-up and skipper Suzie Bates felt that her side must dismiss their tentative approach that hurt them badly in the ODIs. “I think we have a very strong T20 side. All-rounders such as Sophie Devine and Anna Peterson can clear the boundaries with ease. But I am a bit disappointed with how the batswomen have played the Indian spinners. We were very tentative in our approach and things didn’t work for us. It is all about backing ourselves,” said Bates. Bates stressed that this T20I series is an important step towards their preparation for the Women’s World T20, scheduled in India next year. “The series is massive for us. We want to get more familiar with the conditions since we know we will play the World T20 in India next year. The team is looking forward to putting up an improved show,” she said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "About 15 to 20 residents crowded New Market’s town hall Thursday night to comment and question representatives about the planned development for the 262-acre property, which was annexed into the town in 2014. Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Strike up the band! The resistance band that is. Whether you are on the road, or barricaded in your home recovering from the death of your favorite Game of Thrones character, a total body workout is always accessible due to the portability and convenience of the resistance band. These flexible flab fighters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making them perfect for your daily exercise routine or assisted stretching (or to sling shot water balloons at that noisy neighbor). Here’s how to make the most of this one-man resistance band show: Chest to Impress. Find a sturdy support beam or column and evenly wrap your band around it at shoulder height. With your back turned away from the supporting structure, grab each handle and take a large step forward. The beauty of the band is that you can adjust its resistance simply by removing slack from the tube. The further you step away from the column, the harder the exercise becomes. With palms at shoulder height, push through your chest until your arms are completely extended. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions. Reverse Gears. The next exercise requires a similar setup, however you will be facing your support column rather than having your back to it. With a handle in each hand, take a big step backwards while pulling your hands in towards either side of your ribcage. Bring your feet back to center, and perform the same exercise with the opposite foot. The reverse lunge row is a powerful movement in that it targets major muscle groups and aids in bettering your balance. Balancing exercises should be incorporated into every workout routine, as they are crucial in strengthening your core, improving the integrity of your spine and preventing injuries from falls. Complete 15 repetitions per side. Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head. Crank out 12-15 repetitions. Repeat each exercise 3-5 times to guarantee a good burn, baby burn. Sometimes the best cure in the fight against fat is to apply a little resistance band-aid. Earn it.

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday is Comic-Con's sucker baby — a day so easy you don't know what everyone was warning you about. We pretty much walked into the infamous Hall H on the first morning of Comic-Con 2015 — no wristbands and little waiting required. But there were already people camped out in line for the next day's panels, the wristbands for which wouldn't get handed out for 12 hours. The first panel of the day was reserved for Open Road, the distributor behind such films as \"Dope\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" With no description in the schedule, most, if not all, of those in attendance were just waiting around for something else later in the day — the \"Hunger Games\" panel or \"Doctor Who.\" When its start time came and went, some in my section speculated that it'd just been canceled. Then Bill Murray entered the room. Open Road used its hour in Hall H to promote \"Rock the Kasbah,\" a comedy in which Murray stars as a rock music manager who discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice in Afghanistan. It co-stars Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan and Danny McBride, but all the movie needs to drum excitement is Murray, and the marketers know that. He entered through the crowd and answered the moderator's first question in character. The name cards on the dais often give away who's on-hand, but his read, \"Richie Lanz.\" In his first-ever Comic-Con appearance, Murray played to the crowd. \"I feel like I fit in,\" he said. \"I feel like I could fall down in any of these aisles right here and be left alone until I woke.\" What followed was a master class in fan appreciation. By turns funny and gracious, he flirted back when one woman offered to let him spend the night with her on the convention-center lawn. He encouraged a young man who was so nervous that his knees were shaking to move the shaking up to his hips and then to his arms; the kid did, dancing in front of thousands. He was philosophical and sincere, greeting even the most awkward and rambling questions with wit and grace. “I must say it feels wonderful to be in this room,” Murray said. “I like when people get excited about something. There’s a lot of people who don’t get excited about much at all.” With no warning that he’d even be there, it’s likely that no one in Hall H on Thursday morning was there to see Bill Murray. And “Rock the Kasbah” isn’t your typical Comic-Con film. But the move got some of the world’s most rabid pop-culture fans some face-time with one of the industry’s most personable stars — and got Open Road’s little movie in front of them.",
