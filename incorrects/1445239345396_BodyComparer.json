    "DiffbotBody": "With the majority of head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad back in pre-season training, preparations for Tottenham Hotspur's 2014-15 campaign are well underway. For supporters, glimpses of the team's sessions on social media are better than nothing after a month away. But the opportunity to actually see their team in action—players new and old working together for the first time—that is when things begin to feel real again. Over the following pages Bleacher Report looks at Tottenham's announced opponents for this summer's friendlies. We begin with the League One outfit hosting a Spurs XI side (likely consisting of development squad talent and any auxiliary players Pochettino needs to run the rule over), right up to the big-name opposition the first team will face just days prior to the Premier League season opener. Pre-season only tells us so much, but they are nonetheless fascinating steps toward the proper action beginning. Begin Slideshow » Tottenham's first opponents of the summer, Peterborough United, got their pre-season off to a winning start this past week with a 3-2 win over Dulwich Hamlet. On the scoresheet was striker Joe Gormley, signed in June after netting 40 goals for Northern Irish side Cliftonville last season. The 26-year-old's scoring exploits saw him mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by UEFA.com's Darren Fullerton in the spring. Now Peterborough manager Dave Robertson is hoping Gormley can help fire his team out of League One. \"I'm over the moon, he's a fantastic signing for us,\" Robertson told The Posh TV. \"We know that Joe is going to bring goals to the team next season.\" Ninth in England's third tier last season, Posh have also added former West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison to a squad that includes former Spurs goalkeeper Ben Alnwick. The new blood, coupled with last season's experience, has suitably raised expectations. \"Anything but promotion is failure in my eyes,\" defender Michael Smith admitted to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, per BBC Sport. With a game against West Ham already under their belts by then, Peterborough should be in shape to provide Spurs a decent examination of their burgeoning fitness levels. After 2014's three-match North American tour, Tottenham make a briefer visit to the States this year as they participate in the MLS All-Star Game. The eighth English club to be invited to take on the league's best since the old East vs. West All-Star format was abandoned, Spurs follow Bayern Munich who were defeated 2-1 in last year's match. Preferring to keep most of his team's preparations closer to home, the fixture is Pochettino's one pre-season concession to the now-routine activity of Premier League clubs heading overseas to further their global brand. Despite being a primarily commercial exercise, Spurs should find an exacting on-pitch challenge in the form of an MLS select group attempting to again demonstrate their ability against one of European football's famous old names. The still-to-be-confirmed team could well feature former Spurs striker Robbie Keane, in his fifth year with the division's reigning champions Los Angeles Galaxy. For several of Pochettino's team, it will be their first opportunity to get some important minutes in their legs ahead of the Premier League season. Those not making the trip to Colorado will be heading to Hertfordshire as Spurs open August away at . A frequent pre-season opponent over the years, Stevenage's Lamex Stadium also hosts the club's under-21 fixtures that don't take place at the training ground or White Hart Lane. This latest meeting carries extra intrigue in that it is one of the first games for recently installed Stevenage boss and Spurs Hall of Fame inductee Teddy Sheringham. \"The aim is to do better than last season,\" said Sheringham to his new club's official website following his appointment, while understanding that will be difficult given they reached the League Two play-off semi-final. The existing Spurs links at the club did not escape him either. \"I know a few of the boys, the likes of Chris Day were at Tottenham, I think Charlie Lee might have kicked me once or twice when he was coming through the ranks. I know Ronnie Henry too.\" Defender Mark Hughes, midfielder Steven Schumacher and centre-forward Brett Williams have all been drafted in to join those already there. Sheringham told the club's website he intends \"to bring in two or three more players at least\" but also stated \"I like what I have got now, the base of what we have looks really good.\" The Boro first team plays Wealdstone in its first friendly this weekend before visiting St Neots Town next week. Prior to taking on Tottenham in the final warm-up before the season begins, Sheringham's squad will take on another two of his old clubs, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, , have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him. Indeed, the Mirror's Liam Corless reports Real fans were chanting not-so-secret target David De Gea's name during the unveiling of the aforementioned signing from Porto. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid, Tottenham will have one more match in Munich the following day. They will face either or hosts Bayern in either the third/fourth play-off or final. Last season's 10th-place finish in Serie A has prompted change on and off the pitch at Milan. Pippo Inzaghi has been replaced with Sampdoria boss Sinisa Mihajlovic in the San Siro hot seat (almost as toasty as that found at the Bernabeu). Luiz Adriano and Carlos Bacca formerly of Shakhtar Donetsk and Sevilla, respectively, have been brought in to bolster the team's flagging attack. From within Italian borders they have drafted in Andrea Bertolacci and Luca Antonelli to try and improve things in midfield and defence. The Rossoneri would kill for the kind of season Bayern Munich had. Despite a dominant run to the Bundesliga title, the failure to win the Champions League has upped the pressure on Pep Guardiola. Bayern have been brilliant more often than not on his watch. Yet Guardiola's inability thus far to replicate the success enjoyed by the team in Jupp Heynckes' final season two years ago could count against him soon enough, no matter the difficulty of matching 2012-13's extraordinary treble. Should Spurs cross paths with Bayern in August, and depending on the circumstances, they could be witness to a fascinating atmosphere at the Allianz Arena. Iffy performances from the German side in their own tournament do not necessarily mean anything at such an early stage. But Guardiola and his team would prefer to launch their latest pursuit for glory and history in the most positive fashion possible.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

Two years later with the help of his buddies, Martyn successfully mounts his bike and takes off down a mountainous trail. The saying, \"it's as easy as riding bicycle\" rings true in this inspiring video. The moment he takes off, it is clear that his skills are anything but rusty.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Growing up in Turkey in the 1990s, the whole live music scene was dominated by cover bands that played hits from the United States and Europe. It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. But when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was. So I went back and listened to them—and was blown away. Listen to a playlist featuring Turkish artists covered in this story: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the music scene in Turkey flourished, producing local legends including Erkin Koray and Selda Bağcan. But a military coup in 1980 put a definite hold on the arts. There was not much happening besides pop music for a while, but a strong metal scene appeared in the ‘90s, including bands which formed the base for long running acts like Replikas, Nekropsi, and Daire 2: General Gramafon. The Internet then spurred on a new wave of vibrancy within the country's music scene, and underground musicians started to embrace their own roots and write their lyrics in Turkish. Peyote, a music venue located in the heart of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, became the first venue to exclusively book bands with original music, giving way to a healthy artistic community. Musicians in Turkey still face drawbacks on a daily basis: There are still only a handful of venues that host non-cover bands, with bigger venues only booking foreign acts (and not offering local groups support slots), and lots of music festivals have been cancelled due to new government regulations that prevent alcohol sponsorships. But these obstacles have brought bands together as they collectively work to book shows, open DIY venues, and do their own street festivals. Members of Istanbul’s music scene outside Roxy, one of the city's oldest venues for rock shows There are only a few cities in Turkey with music venues, and getting visas to play shows in Europe can be difficult, so touring is not really an option for most underground bands. But the economic inviability of making a living entirely from music—as well as the diminished chances of any type of rock stardom—has effectively eliminated certain types of musicians, leaving behind only the ones who are 100% dedicated to what they do. Right now, despite all the roadblocks in the way, there is an incredibly lively DIY music scene in Turkey, filled with talented musicians. I asked nearly 20 of these artists to take me where they feel at home in Istanbul and talked to them about the current state of the music scene. The journey led me through rehearsal spaces and tea gardens, alleyways and festive feasts.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single. Its ornate but in-the-pocket production is as silky and flawlessly orchestrated a track as Quik has made since the late '90s, and it boasted one of the best lead-off lines for a rap verse this year: \"Now what they want to go cancel Arsenio Hall for?/ Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for.\" Hall’s talk show rose to prominence in the early '90s, around the same time that Quik was finding commercial success, and he appeared on \"Arsenio\" a few times both to rap and DJ; last year—on a newly resurrected version of the show—the rapper announced the release of The Midnight Life. In a song that mostly celebrates living in the present—more focused on the narrative of maintaining than reclaiming glory—the nostalgic line feels poignant; like second-time-loser Arsenio, the perpetually \"most underrated\" Quik has been declared down for the count more than once, and may now be winding down himself. But as in the case of most of Quik’s work, the complaint is just a point in the rapper’s tangled constellation of talking points (mainly, taunts and come-ons to adversaries, fair-weather fans, and the female population of South Central at large), which are as full of ingenious contradictions as his beats. —Winston Cook-Wilson DJ Quik: \"Pet Sematary\" There was a time when the killing in a Lauryn Hill song was done softly and figuratively, through the power of music. That time was long ago. In the late 1990s, a false rumor about the singer/songwriter who would become perhaps rap's most gifted recluse supposedly saying she'd rather die than have white people buying her albums spread so widely there's a Snopes.com page dedicated to debunking it. Over the years since the former Fugees member's sole solo studio album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as she has drifted in and out of the public eye, her self-aggrandizing statements and unfortunate habit of showing up late for live shows have continued to divide, in ways that still say more about the culture than about her. When Hill went to prison to serve a three-month sentence for tax evasion in 2013, she opened herself to further miscomprehension by discussing her conviction in terms of slavery, colonialism, and institutionalized racism. It might not have played well in Peoria, but she was bringing up a legacy America has yet to escape, in ways that became tragically obvious this year. In the same pre-prison pronouncement, Hill said, \"You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\" In 2012, she had premiered a spoken-word piece titled \"Black Rage\", which turned the lyrical framework of Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein's \"My Favorite Things\" into a prolix litany of the crimes that one group of people have perpetrated against another, and a stinging endorsement of anger as an antidote to fear; in later live versions the interpolation became, like John Coltrane's classic cover, a musical one, as well. When the artist, now known professionally as Ms. Lauryn Hill, shared \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" in late August, with a call for peace in Missouri, the times had caught up with her song. She once told an interviewer, \"If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children,\" and this sketch, recorded in her living room, benefits by couching its broad social themes in family-like intimacy; her kids' voices can be heard behind her deepening, huskier roar, along with acoustic guitar and a murmuring rhythm. Some will share Hill's fury, some won't, but her unexpurgated message of focused resilience points toward part of what has been missing all along: A mutual understanding. To promote a new pay-for-view concert video, Hill recently shared a clip of herself performing the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" live in Brooklyn. In the song, as on the original, she raps, \"While you're imitating Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone.\" Simone, the subject of a controversial upcoming biopic, prefigured aspects of Hill's career trajectory in her own evolution toward racial confrontation. Simone reportedly warned Martin Luther King Jr., on meeting him, that she wasn't nonviolent. \"Not to worry, sister,\" King responded; she even later insisted upon being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" You'd never guess it by the ongoing rounds of backlash against Hill, which prompted Talib Kweli to write an essay defending her this year, but this mere Ms. has yet to go as far in her radicalism as the late legend, who, singing the then-new \"Mississippi Goddam\" at Carnegie Hall in 1964, blithely informed a mostly white audience, \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies/ You're all gonna die and die like flies.\" But \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" belongs to that tradition, one of righteous indignation in the face of injustice, speaking to the persecuted wherever they may be, whatever they might look like. And it shows that, for all the actual death and cruelty in the headlines, the sound of music can still be quietly devastating. —Marc Hogan The other side of \"Chorus\", a 12'' single issued at the start of the year by the globally minded electronic producer Holly Herndon, sounds like an audition tape for the relatively esoteric sound-art label Editions Mego. During \"Solo Voice\", slivers and snapshots of her voice twist into pointillist spires—chirpy and more musical than the most recent experiments of clear inspiration Florian Hecker, but only by degrees. Even Herndon’s most kinetic work has always seemed as driven by ideas as approachability, and \"Solo Voice\" is an unabashed expression of the former. Could a disembodied and dissected human voice be built into something new with computers? \"Chorus\" explores a similar line of inquiry. Herndon splits her simple, fetching melody into bits, so that her words seem sung by a cyborg programmed with a speech impediment. Syllables end abruptly, stand alone, and stretch over open space. But Herndon twists those samples of herself around beats that sometimes boom and burst like dubstep and sometimes stutter and sprint like IDM. In the space between the two, Herndon laces a panoply of fragments gathered piecemeal as she browsed online. The result, vividly illustrated in a subsequent video collaboration with Japanese artist Akihiko Taniguchi, blurs the relationship between web and browser, machine and user, data and devourer. Herndon becomes the principal input in a system bigger than herself, and she tries to be altered without being absorbed. It’s a canny reflection on our digital lives, rendered with a physicality that pulls it back into our own mainframe. —Grayson Haver Currin \"I Am Not Afraid\", the track that kicks off the gorgeous In Conflict, is as much a riddle as it is a song. Those who may have arrived at Owen Pallett’s music by way of his theoretical explications of pop tracks wouldn’t have been surprised at the obvious intelligence of the writing here, or the foreboding and beauty of the music behind it. It would have been more discomfiting to reckon with the intense strangeness of lyrics that seem several worlds away from the crush-love-heartbreak-repeat cycle of the pop music Pallett clearly understands so well. Pallett has said that In Conflict is the first of his records on which he tried to write lyrics that were both non-allegorical and autobiographical. But even if the material \"I Am Not Afraid\" draws upon comes from Pallett’s own life, the song is extraordinarily rich in imagery and metaphor, whether it’s Pallett leaving his \"violin unattended in a cab or restaurant\" or sharing lyrics like \"They told me to chew on a toothpick/ They told me to take a deep breath.\" These are depictions of anxiety and anger—heady emotions clashing with the record’s central message that its subject is not afraid and salvation may be found in discipline. So while there’s clearly that eponymous conflict in effect here, the idea motivating the song remains fleeting. The music of \"I Am Not Afraid\" is mostly gorgeous as it transitions from violin to piano and back, but it is also strange, and sometimes frightening (a result of Pallett dropping what he calls \"black notes\"—i.e., the exact wrong note for the melody—into the mix). Accepting the discomfort of the very music here, and accepting the discomfort of the lyrics, becomes both a metaphor and a microcosm of the experience that those born into any of the groups that hold dominion (whites, males, cisgenders) must undertake to reckon with their unearned status. To draw on what Pallett has said directly, this musical and lyrical confusion also functions as a metaphor for his own \"displacement and dysphoria.\" By taking the political and rendering it both personal and deliberately inscrutable, Pallett has managed to confound in the best way possible and create a relatable pop experience for voices that are too often ignored. —Jonah Bromwich It’s been an art from blues to Britney: the song as extended double entendre, one that can come off either unassailably clean or unspeakably filthy depending on the listener’s life experience and cleanliness of mind (or nearness to a Google searchbox). \"Love Me Harder\" is sort of the opposite: even when it’s clean it sounds teasingly off, and even when it’s dirty, it sounds so disarmingly spit-shine clean. Much of it’s the premise: pairing a singer who was a babysitter on Nickelodeon less than half a year ago with a singer whose discography contains endless variations on permanently corrupting young ingenues, with no apologies and no inclinations to change that. Even more of it’s the execution: organ peals timed like winks after each line; Grande switching emotional beats like poses, her voice either knowing beyond her years or just polished to sound like it, with no indication as to which; Tesfaye revisiting the sturdy nocturnal electro-house of his Kavinsky collaboration (a sound that’s been fast adopted by the pop trickbook, from megastars to newcomers), leering about his rep and finding a way to describe hardcore porn acts in PG terms. When these tracks fail, they’re the most embarrassing failures an artist can have; when they succeed, the sleight of song can be breathtaking. Here’s to a generation of kids realizing horrifying things in 2020 about their teenage jam—and what lodged it in their mind. —Katherine St. Asaph Ariana Grande: \"Love Me Harder\" [ft. The Weeknd] Tobias Jesso Jr. isn't the first guy to have his heart squashed by Los Angeles. After failing to make it as a pop songwriter, breaking up with his girlfriend, getting hit by a car, and—icing on the cake—moving to to Vancouver to help care for his ailing mother, balloons fell from the ceiling as Jesso became the world's one billionth failed songwriter. So he dusted off his sister's old piano, wrote a few heart-stricken ballads, and posted them to Youtube. What happened next was unlikely: An email to Chet \"JR\" White (whose band Girls had just broken up) led to a True Panther signing and bam—Jesso's back on his feet, with a debut tiled Goon slated for next year. His breakthrough track, \"True Love\", is perhaps an even less likely success. About as bald-faced and hopelessly romantic as music in 2014 comes, Jesso calls on the spirits of the underdog singer-songwriters of the '70s (think Randy Newman circa Good Old Boys), nicks the melody from Nelly's \"Dilemma\" almost wholesale, and delivers one of the best lump-in-your throat choruses of the year. Which isn't to mention that it sounds like a half-tempo version of the saddest '80s sitcom theme song ever recorded. But there's something so worn and natural about it, it's hard to think of it as anything but the purest declaration of the heart. Call up the YouTube video for \"True Love\", and you'll find a family photograph of Jesso at maybe seven or eight-years-old, looking up at the camera with his fingers poking at a cheap Casio keyboard. It's hard not to believe the kid would make it after all. —Zach Kelly Tobias Jesso Jr.: \"True Love\" Beyoncé hasn’t been a traditional singles artist for years—4, her 2011 opus, didn’t even put anything in the top 10. And when you Beyoncé not only an album into the world but over a dozen songs with prime-time-ready videos, the formula’s bound to be shaken even further. The obvious industry singles—Ryan Tedder collab \"XO\", erstwhile Katy Perry song \"Pretty Hurts\", whatever “Standing on the Sun” was supposed to be in the months Before Knowles—floundered; even \"Drunk in Love\", a bona fide hit that rode the pomp and TV performance circuit to No. 2, seemed more like a populist underdog fighting chart trends than a preordained smash. Yet there were alternatives: 14 songs, all different, yet each personality-packed, like a personality quiz without any of the data-mining malaise—except the sort that produces people’s-choice singles. And the people’s choice, it turns out, was \"Partition\". If Beyoncé-the-statement was reducible to a single track, this would be it. Jay-Z asserts his presence without actually commandeering the track to rap about breastses and breakfast. Beyoncé thoroughly enjoys her reverie, fetishizing their own celebrity because who else gets to do it? And the track balances no-nonsense hitmaking—the hook’s her most traditionally urban radio-ready since B’Day, the beat roaring from simmer to insatiable and back within seconds—and nonchalant trolling. If you think \"Partition\" is a load of oversharing in a cab seat, Beyoncé is mocking you via a French Big Lebowski lecture. If you think \"Partition\" is a big cameras-flashing FEMINIST TRIUMPH, Beyoncé will make you frame that around a goofy Big Lebowski quote, knowing you’ll share it on all platforms anyway. It’s provocative, let’s say; it gets the people going. —Katherine St. Asaph It wasn’t so long ago that being a Young Thug fan felt like you were in on rap’s most rewarding secret. Revelling in the unpredictability of his I Came From Nothing mixtape series, I can honestly admit that, no, I didn’t see his success coming: even at his poppiest, Thug felt way too weird to transcend cult status. Even on his breakthrough release, 2013’s 1017 Thug, the bits that rose to the top were highly tweetable but barely marketable; keep in mind, this was still pre-\"Versace\", a song that would be used as a punchline by \"serious\" rap fans as often as it would be celebrated later that year. That feels like ages ago. Thug closes 2014 as, if not quite a household name, an unavoidable presence in the rap landscape. A short list of stars who co-opted his once-singular swag this year includes Nicki Minaj, T.I., Gucci Mane, and Lil Wayne (his closest spiritual progenitor, who at this point feels prudish in relation), not to mention the dozens of impressionable ATLiens who’ve practically made his yelps and chirps into its own subgenre. It isn’t that Thug’s succeeded in spite of his quirks: they’ve become the hook. The odder he gets, the more people respond, his endless idiosyncrasies feeding the insatiable demand for clicks that’s come to reshape online media. Such a near-sighted focus on the \"weirdness\" sells Thug short. Of his three major singles this year, each highlighted a distinct facet of his skill set. \"Danny Glover\" was peak zaniness, probing the outer limits of what constitutes catchiness; \"The Blanguage\", in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin, presented Thug as a deft lyricist and effective balladeer. But best of all was \"Stoner\", in which words fell short as descriptors and functioned instead as measurements of rhythm and space. If anything, it made more sense as a grime song than a rap song, with Dun Deal’s spare beat challenging Thug to find new ways to make himself comfortable within it. It struck a precarious balance between restraint and release: an unsure hand could've sent the whole thing toppling. It wasn’t weird—it was masterful. —Meaghan Garvey Young Thug: \"Stoner\" There are qualities about Mike Hadreas that make him seem heroic: His songbook takes on themes of trauma and addiction, the body and identity, all in a way that seems designed to protect us—a reminder that we're not alone in our otherness. This year, Hadreas has been selling T-shirts depicting an emasculated Eminem, a proper jab at one of popular music's most problematic living artists. On the shirt, Slim is clad in coral lipstick, just a few shades lighter than the tint Hadreas wore on his watershed \"Letterman\" performance in October, contorting a slow, sultry sway through \"Queen\". Indeed, Hadreas' work as Perfume Genius has opened a crucial dialogue over the past half decade. Recall the 2012 incident with his 16-second YouTube ad for Put Your Back N 2 It getting censored for \"promoting mature sexual themes\" because it featured two shirtless men hugging. As there's no shortage of topless folks on YouTube, the message from Google was clear: it was the queerness that was unsuitable and—as the corporation wrote in a statement—\"not family safe.\" And so, should you need convincing, the quaking \"Queen\" is empirically necessary. \"No family is safe/ When I sashay,\" Hadreas asserts through expressive breaths on the refrain of the year, channeling personal rage into a surreal energy, addressing gay panic—the idea that one's visible otherness as a gay individual makes people uncomfortable, that it’s perceived as a threat to the straight world. Hadreas sounds just as defiant and poetic in 2014 as Patti Smith did in 1975 telling us how Jesus did not die for her sins. And like Smith's earth-shattering subversions of the female archetype, Hadreas' provocations are confident, uncompromising, epic—he appoints himself \"queen\" and owns the supposed flaws of his sexuality (\"cracked, peeling, riddled with disease\") with a deviant wink and demonic smirk. One would expect music that is both radically politicized and universal from someone who grew up listening to \"a lot of badass feminist music\" and who says he's seen Sleater-Kinney at least 13 times. His words alone have such inspired power—imagine them publicly broadcast on a marquee in LED lighting, like a Jenny Holzer installation—but \"Queen\" does not just illuminate the potential of explicit language. It has few aesthetic precedents, though it pushes the borders of pop and avant-gardism in a way Arthur Russell would have appreciated. The cool drag of a drum contribution from PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish morphed the song into what has been aptly described in interviews as \"stoner glam.\" There is a tornado swirling—a deep, booming low-end; abrasive synths rolling into an ecstatic dreamscape; passing clouds made of soul—and Hadreas is at the eye of the storm, a light steadily beaming from the chaos of the world, stepping into the future. \"Queen\" is a gay anthem, but it also empathizes broadly with all people who biologically have less direct access to the top seats in society. In a year that rendered the world's rampant, widespread injustice so depressingly apparent, what could keep us believing that all this music stuff matters so much? It's songs like \"Queen\" and the sea changes they summon that give it purpose. The future of pop belongs to people like Hadreas, who will take us forward to new places we didn't know we needed to go. Surrounded by this loud, extreme music, it sounds like nothing can hurt him now. —Jenn Pelly Perfume Genius: \"Queen\"",
    "LabBody": "In one of 2014’s quietest revelations, Gainesville quartet Hundred Waters transcended one of pop music’s most shopworn clichés. An upstart group emerged from nowhere in 2012 with a polished, wholly unique debut record, is subsequently chased by every noteworthy major-indie, chooses instead to take Skrillex’s money…and succeeds on all counts. The Moon Rang Like a Bell expands on the promise of their debut album without sacrificing anything about what made it good. They upgrade their IDM faerie-queene origins to the oddball electro/R\u0026B mainstage of FKA twigs, Purity Ring, and How to Dress Well, in other words, but on \"Murmurs\", singer/songwriter Nicole Miglis still manages to sneak in the word \"thee.\" The group sets \"Murmurs\" in the kind of ice palace pioneered by the Cocteau Twins or Homogenic, but Miglis pitches her voice to a pained upper register that Björk or Elisabeth Fraser never went. It’s a breakup song themed around a missed birthday—images of candles and wishes abound—but the production’s combination of churchly solemnity and far-off, slow-motion industrial clamor suggest something much more universal: the consistent drone of modern life co-existing with timeless cycles of loss and rebirth. Above all, though, is the song's devotion to \"thee,\" that constant, all-too-human desire to view experience through someone else’s eyes. —Eric Harvey. Hundred Waters: \"Murmurs\" (via SoundCloud)",

    "DiffbotBody": "The state Board of Land and Natural Resources might restrict nighttime, nonvehicular access to Mauna Kea. Ikaikamaiki Keone-Kinimaka visited Mauna Kea on June 26. State officials released Thursday a long list of issues and problems linked to Thirty Meter Telescope protesters ahead of Friday’s state Board of Land and Natural Resources meeting to consider restricting nonvehicular nighttime access to the Mauna Kea summit region. A proposed emergency rule would restrict access to anyone not traveling in a vehicle on Mauna Kea Access Road from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. The rule would also prohibit camping gear, including blankets and tarpaulins, within 1 mile of the road at any time. Friday’s 9 a.m. meeting is the Land Board’s regularly scheduled meeting in Conference Room 132 of the Kalanimoku Building, 1151 Punchbowl St. While state officials have said the emergency rule is designed to promote safe access to the summit and is not necessarily aimed at any one group, the protesters contend the rule is specifically targeted at them and intended to prevent them from blocking construction of the $1.4 billion TMT project near Mauna Kea’s summit on land they consider sacred. On Thursday the state released three months of activity logs maintained by the University of Hawaii’s Maunakea Visitor Information Station and Office of Mauna Kea Management rangers, along with some highlighted incidents that officials say illustrate the need for the emergency rule. Incidents recorded at the visitor center include bomb threats, theats of violence against TMT workers, glaring and staring at center staff members, yelling in the visitor gallery, harassing visitors and staff, vandalizing the bathrooms, suspected shoplifting of souvenirs from the gift shop, disrupting center operations, smoking marijuana and blocking the road. Incidents observed by the Mauna Kea rangers include the illegal construction of shelters and cultural features in the forest reserve near the visitor center, plus the discovery of invasive ants and plant material — including black bamboo, ti leaf plants, a monkeypod tree seed pod and guava sticks — identified as high risk for introduction of invasive species. According to their logs, rangers also reported hostile and intimidating comments and gestures directed toward observatory workers and visitor center staffers, plus damaged and defaced property. In addition, they reported a drop in the number of commercial tours visiting the summit. Dan Meisenzahl, UH spokesman, said the hostile incidents are not representative of all the protesters. On several occasions, he said, some of them have helped to defuse some situations. Leaders of the “protectors,” as they call themselves, maintain that their three-month presence on the mountain has been generally courteous and respectful, required only by the need to prevent desecration of the sacred mountain. They also say the group practices kapu aloha and aloha aina in a tradition of nonviolent protest and respect and integrity for the land. Mauna Kea Access Road and the Maunakea Visitor Information Station have been closed to the public since a June 24 clash with a TMT work convoy that resulted in 12 arrests. With the help of rocks and boulders placed on the gravel road above the 9,200-foot level, protesters turned back the TMT work crews ascending the mountain to try to restart construction of what’s expected to be one of the most powerful optical telescopes in the world.",

    "DiffbotBody": "While being single may seem difficult, we can find happiness in the dating process as we improve ourselves and our outlook on life. Last year, it was reported that single people in America now outnumber married people. There are many theories and ideas about why this is. One might think that it would be easier to find a soul mate because of online dating sites, but it seems that this has changed our millennial mindset, making us pickier than ever. Read: The most overlooked characteristic of who you want to marry The research group Euromonitor even predicts that by 2020, there will be 48 million new single residents, an uptick of over 20 percent of the current number. Notwithstanding, many of us still crave companionship, a void that nothing else in life can seem to fill. The dating game can be exhausting and frustrating, especially when we experience repeated breakups, which causes real, actual grief. Once this grief is properly addressed, which can include therapy, we still may be left asking ourselves, \"Why am I still single?\" My experience has shown me that usually it's not other people; it's me who needs to change. When I say this, I don't mean that we need to change who we are; rather, change what we're doing and why we're doing it. 1. Make it a matter of prayer Communing with God to better understand His plan for you can help you find peace in a brutal world. Consider that God's ways are higher than ours; He has a plan for each of us. God wants us to talk with Him. By putting Him at the forefront of our dating lives, asking Him questions, and turning to holy scripture for answers, we'll perhaps find some of the answers to why we haven't married yet. God does want us to marry, have families and learn to become like Him. Seek His guidance in what it will take to get to that point. 2. Meet as many people as possible Years ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a goal to go on dates with 50 girls. I remember exclaiming that was a lot. He then told me that he wanted to go out with as many people as possible to learn what he did and didn't like. He kept a journal of these dates, and started to notice a consistent theme in his preferences. My friend never made it to his goal of 50, because along the way, he met his wife. By the time she came along, it was apparent to my friend that this wonderful woman would make an excellent companion. He moved quickly and asked her to marry him. She accepted, and they have a wonderful life and a cute little boy. From this experience, it's apparent that putting ourselves out there will broaden our opportunities. If my friend hadn't been going places where he knew he could meet quality girls, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet and date his wife. Use every avenue possible to put yourself in front of people. As you are out there, remember that you may get rejected from time to time. That's OK. Take those experiences, learn from them, then move on to meeting more people. If you follow this pattern, you'll find rejection happens less and less. 3. Make a list of qualities you find attractive Also, make a list of things that aren't attractive to you. From these two lists, pick three things you absolutely must have, three things you absolutely can't stand and then discard the rest. No one is perfect, so simply focus on the values and attributes in a person that are most important to you. Finally, make a third list, but make it about you. What do you need to do to be deserving of this ideal mate? Only you can answer these questions, but seeking out the advice of family and close friends in this regard will help you narrow down your best and worst qualities. From this final list, make any necessary changes in your personal behavior, and hold yourself accountable to someone (such as a parent or best friend) to measure your progess. During this time, it's important that you keep dating, because this will give you realtime feedback about your improvements. 4. Be kind and stay positive Kindness goes a long way, especially in the dating realm. This isn't to say that you should go on a pity date with everyone who shows interest; rather, politely declining an invitation in a kind way will do a lot for your personal self worth, and it will make it easier to stay within your preferences. Read: 10 signs you’re in the right relationship Staying positive can be tough, especially if it's been a while since you've been in a relationship, but focus on the good things in your life. Keep your friends and family close; exercise; read; expand your hobbies and talents. Eventually, for most of us, the right person does come along. Until then, if you are the very best person you can be, you can find happiness in the single life.

    "LabBody": "HANAU, Germany (AP) - A U.S. Army sergeant who beheaded his wife's lover and brought the head to her hospital bed so she could see what he had done was convicted of murder Friday. After the verdict, the victim's mother, Irene Glover of Phoenix, made a brief and tearful statement mourning the loss of her 21-year-old son, Gregory. \"I used to have a spark in my eye and a jump in my step, but now I'm nothing,\" she said. \"A part of me is gone.\" Her son died Dec. 7 in a gruesome climax to a lovers' triangle at the U.S. Army base at Fulda in central Germany. The defendant, Sgt. Stephen Schap, 26, of Baltimore, figured out his wife, Diane, was pregnant by Glover. Schap found Glover at a telephone booth talking to Schap's wife, who was in the hospital with a pregnancy problem. Schap stabbed Glover 10 to 15 times with a double-edged knife and, witnesses testified, kicked the victim's head off. He then stalked away carrying the head, saying sarcastically, \"And he said he was sorry.\" Diane Schap, 26, also of Baltimore, testified Wednesday that her husband came into her hospital room with Glover's head and said: \"Look, Diane, Glover's here. He'll sleep with you every night, only you won't sleep at night.\" About six months pregnant, she testified her husband told her he had studied and planned the killing and did it because he loved her. A jury of four officers and three non-commissioned officers deliberated less than two hours before reaching the guilty verdict. The judge, Lt. Col. Charles E. Trant, said he would instruct the jury to impose the mandatory life sentence when the court went back into session Saturday. Schap's defense argued in vain for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter on grounds he was in an irrational rage when he killed Glover. Defense lawyer David Court said in his closing argument Friday that Schap was so devoted to his wife that he had a vasectomy three years ago after she had three miscarriages and he did not want to cause her more pain.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday is Comic-Con's sucker baby — a day so easy you don't know what everyone was warning you about. We pretty much walked into the infamous Hall H on the first morning of Comic-Con 2015 — no wristbands and little waiting required. But there were already people camped out in line for the next day's panels, the wristbands for which wouldn't get handed out for 12 hours. The first panel of the day was reserved for Open Road, the distributor behind such films as \"Dope\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" With no description in the schedule, most, if not all, of those in attendance were just waiting around for something else later in the day — the \"Hunger Games\" panel or \"Doctor Who.\" When its start time came and went, some in my section speculated that it'd just been canceled. Then Bill Murray entered the room. Open Road used its hour in Hall H to promote \"Rock the Kasbah,\" a comedy in which Murray stars as a rock music manager who discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice in Afghanistan. It co-stars Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan and Danny McBride, but all the movie needs to drum excitement is Murray, and the marketers know that. He entered through the crowd and answered the moderator's first question in character. The name cards on the dais often give away who's on-hand, but his read, \"Richie Lanz.\" In his first-ever Comic-Con appearance, Murray played to the crowd. \"I feel like I fit in,\" he said. \"I feel like I could fall down in any of these aisles right here and be left alone until I woke.\" What followed was a master class in fan appreciation. By turns funny and gracious, he flirted back when one woman offered to let him spend the night with her on the convention-center lawn. He encouraged a young man who was so nervous that his knees were shaking to move the shaking up to his hips and then to his arms; the kid did, dancing in front of thousands. He was philosophical and sincere, greeting even the most awkward and rambling questions with wit and grace. “I must say it feels wonderful to be in this room,” Murray said. “I like when people get excited about something. There’s a lot of people who don’t get excited about much at all.” With no warning that he’d even be there, it’s likely that no one in Hall H on Thursday morning was there to see Bill Murray.

    "DiffbotBody": "The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. \"Brown Sugar\" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, \"all the nasty subjects in one go\"). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R\u0026B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of \"Wild Horses\" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of \"Dead Flowers\" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (\"You Gotta Move\") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R\u0026B of \"I Got the Blues\" to the crunchy boogie of \"Bitch\" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on \"Dead Flowers\" is obviously played for laughs, but \"You Gotta Move\" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. \"I Got the Blues\" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. \"Sister Morphine\" and \"Moonlight Mile\" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of \"Brown Sugar\" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on \"Miami Vice\" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.",
    "LabBody": "The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art.

    "LabBody": "MANLY | Hannah Ausenhus had no idea what to expect this year. The only thing she knew coming into this season was that Central Springs needed a pitcher after losing all-stater Lexi Korte to graduation. The season opener arrived and Panthers coach Belinda Nelson decided it was the right time to throw Ausenhus, an eighth-grader, in the circle. What has resulted has been much better than anyone expected. Friday, in a Class 2A regional semifinal, things got a little bit sweeter. Ausenhus tossed a no-hitter as No. 7 Central Springs topped South Hamilton 3-0 to move the Panthers one win away from a berth in the state tournament. “I just wanted to come out strong and relaxed and have my defense help me behind me,” Ausenhus said. And help her defense did. In the second inning, while a no-hitter was still the furthest thing from Ausenhus and Panthers’ minds, shortstop Morgan Kelley made a great play on a bloop right behind the circle in which she went full extension to snag the ball, which would’ve most likely gone for a single, just before it hit the ground. The final play in the field was perhaps the most important. With two outs in the seventh and one strike away from completing the no-hitter, South Hamilton designated hitter Ronnie Olson sent a sharp liner into right field. With her glove extended, Central Springs right fielder back-handed the ball and made a sliding grab for the final out and a new souvenir for Ausenhus to remember this performance. “This group is all about team. There’s no I’s,” Nelson said. “This group just goes out to play together and they support each other no matter what and I love that about them.” It was Ausenhus’ third no-hitter of her career – her first coming in a 7-0 win over North Butler and second in an 11-0 win in five innings over Riceville. Coming into Friday, the task looked to be a tough one as South Hamilton had put up 14 runs in each of its first two tournament games. “I knew I had to throw hard and make my movement go and they just swung at them,” Ausenhus, who finished her night with nine strikeouts and three walks, said. “The one thing, when she comes she doesn’t have any nerves,” Nelson added. “She’s so coachable and (assistant coach) Angela (Korte) and her work right together and they know what’s working and what’s not.” The Panthers wasted no time getting on the board as Anna Dietrich scored on a passed ball in the first inning. Haliee Ausenhus gave her sister Hannah another boost in the fourth inning when she drove a home run over the left field fence. Kelli Wilson drove in Central Springs’ final run of the contest in the fifth on a groundout that scored Dietrich. The Panthers (26-5) advance to a regional final Monday against Manson-Northwest Webster (10-17) at Mason City. The winner will advance to the Class 2A state tournament. “These three seniors (Kaitlyn Faught, Brittany Florea and Casey Kisner), they wanted to do this and I’m excited for them. I hope we can go and finish it,” Nelson said.",

Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: First, stand barefoot and then rise onto your toes repeatedly. Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "LabBody": "BLOOMINGTON — A requirement that Illinois sex offenders report all Internet sites they use to police is unconstitutional because it violates the offenders’ free speech rights, according to a ruling by a McLean County judge. Judge Robert Freitag agreed with arguments from the defense lawyer for Mark Minnis, 22, of Normal, that state law is overly broad in its mandate that all email addresses and sites a sex offender uses or plans to use, including Facebook, must be registered with police. Minnis was charged with failure to register the address of his residence after he missed his annual registration deadline by three days in August. As part of that requirement, he disclosed two email addresses, but did not list a Facebook and Ebay account he uses, according to court records. States’s Attorney Jason Chambers said Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office plans to ask the Illinois Supreme Court to review the decision. The high court's ruling will impact all future Illinois cases on the First Amendment issue in sex offender cases. Defense lawyer Stephanie Wong said Thursday the Internet portion of the law “is not well-written and provides no guidance as to what the requirements are. The statute has to be more narrowly tailored.” According to Wong, no other court decisions have been issued on the free speech aspect of the state’s Sex Offender Registration Act. In Wong’s opinion, the opinion issued Tuesday by Freitag bars authorities from enforcing the Internet requirement at this point. In his order, Freitag cited a federal court decision challenging a similar mandate in Nebraska. The court there said ordering a sex offender to report all access to Internet sites “clearly chills offenders from engaging in expressive activity that is otherwise perfectly proper, and the statute is therefore insufficiently narrow.” Freitag noted that he is not bound to follow the federal opinion, but found the reasoning in the case “to be persuasive and sound.” Chambers said his office “takes sex offender cases very seriously.” The conditions imposed on sex offenders living in the community “are not meant as a penalty, but for the safety of those living around them,” he said. The rules related to Internet access are one of many requirements for Illinois sex offenders. Restrictions on where offenders can live, work and visit puts them at risk for criminal charges and incarceration if not strictly followed. Follow Edith Brady-Lunny on Twitter: @pg_blunny.",

First, we turn against the person who is gone. When we realize that doesn't solve the problem, we turn on ourselves. We argue that we deserve it, for surely we are not good enough! We feel vulnerable and find ourselves susceptible to every look and comment. In order to mask the vulnerability, we adopt self-defeating behaviors. We sleep in, overeat, withhold positive self-talk and make ourselves do things that are difficult, scary or cruel. We think that if we inflict enough emotional pain on ourselves, either we will feel better or perhaps someone will come to our rescue. They will feel sorry for us, bind up our wounds and give us the love that we desperately need. Unfortunately, these types of relationships don't solve heartaches; they create more of them! Healing is possible \"One day while I was lying in bed, nursing my heartache and waiting for the world to end, I heard a knock above my head. I looked up, but there was nothing on the headboard that could have fallen to make the sound. I knew it was God. He was telling me, 'Get up! Stop moping around and do something!'\" Although time may assuage the pain, a heartache does not heal itself. The heart is the very center of the soul; it is the connecting link between the spirit and the body. The person we love becomes a part of us. When they leave, we feel a deep sense of loss, and the pain may seem unbearable. The only way to fill the hole left by a heartache is to turn to God. This requires that we become humble, willing, obedient and serve others. Humility The pain of heartache brings us to our knees. We realize our dependence upon God, and acknowledge that we cannot overcome this difficulty on our own. We need Him to help us. We give Him our burden of weakness and imperfection, and express our desire to be healed. Willingness We accept our imperfect state, and open our minds and hearts to God's healing power. We give all that we have to Him in exchange for His unconditional love. Our souls are bathed with the peace \"which passeth all understanding\" Philippians 4:7. Obedience We truly can feel whole and complete once again. The bitterness of the heartache will subside. We can show our gratitude to God by taking His hand and walking with Him, knowing that no matter what happens, He is there for us. Service As we serve others, our feelings of love for them will increase and we will desire to help those that are in pain. Finding ways to give helps fill the emptiness that our heartache left behind. We will feel a renewed sense of purpose, joy and happiness in life. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Heartaches are not the end of the world if we don't allow them to be. They are simply one more way for us to become closer to God. As we do so, we find that there are many others who walk similar paths, and that our experience can be used to help them.",

Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Same-sex couples will now be eligible for federal marriage benefits, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced Thursday. “I am proud to announce that the critical programs for veterans and elderly and disabled Americans, which previously could not give effect to the marriages of couples living in states that did not recognize those marriages, will now provide federal recognition for all marriages nationwide,” Lynch said in a statement. The Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 ruling last month that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and that all states must grant gay and lesbian couples marriage licenses. Before the ruling, 13 states did not recognize same-sex marriage. Many federal marriage benefits were available to same-sex couples after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal ban on gay marriage. Some benefits, though, including Social Security and veterans benefits for spouses, were still unavailable to these couples if they lived in states that did not recognize their marriages. “With the Supreme Court’s new ruling that the Constitution requires marriage equality, we have now taken the further step of ensuring that all federal benefits will be available equally to married couples in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories,” Lynch said. The Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs said they were still working to implement the ruling, with the Social Security Administration issuing a statement that same-sex couples should apply for benefits right away, if they believe they qualify. The VA said that it will be issuing new guidance shortly, but in the meantime it will temporarily wait to rule on claims that were not covered previous to the Supreme Court ruling. Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney for Gay \u0026 Lesbian Advocates \u0026 Defenders, a legal advocacy group, told AP that there are still questions to be resolved regarding the implementation of the ruling. Issues of couples needing to re-apply if they had already been denied benefits have been raised. \"With this terrific statement from the attorney general, the devil is in the details,\" Henry said. \"Marriage benefits are available to same-sex couples nationwide, and that's as it should be. I think that is what the Supreme Court ruling requires. But what does that mean?\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "This past holiday weekend, American pop star Ariana Grande was filmed licking some donuts in a California bakery and then casually expressing her hatred for America. Grande has since apologized for the comments, but failed to acknowledge the donut-licking incident. While her actions were undeniably gross, we can’t help but wonder if licking someone else’s food is actually a public health concern. Saliva gets a bad rap for being gross, and rightfully so; it’s literally filled with bacteria and viruses. “The mouth is a perfect environment for growing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It’s warm and dark, food goes in there several times a day, and there are lots of little nooks and crannies where food can get caught,” said dentist and oral microbiologist Donna Mager, of the Forsyth Institute, a nonprofit group that focuses on oral and craniofacial research, as reported by Discover Magazine. Some of the most common diseases which can spread through saliva are strep throat, the common cold, mumps, meningitis, herpes, mononucleosis, and more rare conditions such as foot-and-mouth disease, The Huffington Post reported. With that being said, just because saliva is filled with germs does not necessarily mean it’s particularly dangerous. Ever wonder why animals instinctively lick their wounds? It could be that Fido is onto something that we’ve overlooked. Along with germs and pathogens, saliva is also filled with unique antibodies and antimicrobial compounds that help to disable these germs and viruses. Even HIV can be destroyed by oral antibodies, which is why it’s nearly impossible to pass on the virus through saliva. Most of the bacteria in the mouth are anaerobic, meaning they cannot survive long in the presence of oxygen, or in the case of obligate anaerobes, cannot survive at all once they hit air. Some common examples of anaerobic bacteria include E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and C. botulinum. While each of these bacteria have different lifespans once they leave a body, one thing is for sure: Once they hit the air, the clock starts ticking. This means that, depending on the amount of time between Grande’s infamous donut licks and when that donut was eaten by an unsuspecting customer, the large majority of bacteria could have quite possibly died off quite soon after the moisture from her saliva dried up. Now while bacteria may be sensitive to the outside world, viruses, on the other hand, are quite resilient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B can survive outside the body for at least seven days and still be capable of causing infection. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service reports that cold viruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for more than a week. Flu viruses have a shorter outside lifespan of only around a day, and stomach bugs, such as the norovirus, can last for weeks. With that being said, however, the effectiveness of the virus starts to decrease after about 24 hours of being outside of a host, so not too much cause for concern. Regardless of the public health risk licking donuts may be, health authorities aren’t taking any chances. The bakery, Wolfee Donuts in California has reportedly received a docked health grade a day after the incidence was released to the public, and according to Perez Hilton, the Riverside Department of Environmental Health is currently investigating the incident and reviewing whether or not it is in violation of health codes. Considering that everything from diarrhea-inducing listeria to glass was found in food this year, a pint-sized pop star’s saliva is probably the very least of our concerns.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Type 2 diabetes may have consequences not only on the body, but on the brain as well. According to a new study, those with type 2 diabetes experienced negative changes in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, which was associated with lower scores on memory and cognition tests. \"Normal blood flow regulation allows the brain to redistribute blood to areas of the brain that have increased activity while performing certain tasks,\" said study author Dr. Vera Novak, of Harvard Medical School in Boston in a press release. \"People with type 2 diabetes have impaired blood flow regulation. Our results suggest that diabetes and high blood sugar impose a chronic negative effect on cognitive and decision-making skills.\" The study, published in Neurology, involved 40 people — 19 of which had type 2 diabetes and 21 that did not. The average age of participants was 66, and those with diabetes had been treated for an average of 13 years. The participants were tested at the beginning of the study and then two years later. In addition to the cognition tests, subjects underwent an MRI scan of the brain to observe blood flow and a blood test to measure control of blood sugar and inflammation. After two years, the participants with type 2 diabetes collectively had decreases in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, down by about 65 percent. They also scored 12 percent lower on memory and cognition tests than they had two years ago, while those without diabetes scored the same. \"Early detection and monitoring of blood flow regulation may be an important predictor of accelerated changes in cognitive and decision-making skills,\" Novak said. She also added that additional studies with larger sample sets and a more extended follow-up time would be needed to better understand the relationship between blood flow regulation and changes in memory and thinking skills. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95 percent of diabetes cases in adults, and several studies have shown that regular physical activity and a healthy diet can prevent or delay the onset. Past studies have identified links between the condition and problems with blood flow in the brain, but the effect it has on cognition is only now being investigated.

    "LabBody": "SIOUX CITY | Dale Hebda and his employees at Hebda Produce were determined to have sweet corn ready by the Fourth of July weekend. To reach that goal, they first had to grow their corn in pots in a hothouse because corn doesn’t grow well in cooler spring weather, said Hebda. They would later transplant the stalks outside. “We changed its environment,” said Hebda, who owns the farm at 30661 444th Ave. in Mission Hill, South Dakota. The result was a harvest of early sweet corn in time for farmers markets in Sioux Falls and Vermillion during the Fourth of July weekend, as well as the Sioux City Farmers Market on Wednesday. But Hebda is ahead of schedule. Most farmers won’t be harvesting sweet corn for another 10 days or so, due to the slightly cooler than average spring, said Iowa State University field agronomist Joel DeJong. “I think (the time frame) is pretty close to normal. Maybe a shade later than normal, but it’s pretty close to what our time frame (for sweet corn) normally is,” DeJong said. The first harvest of sweet corn is undeniably close, though. DeJong said corn plants in many Iowa fields have sprouted tassels, the \"male\" flowers at the top of the plant that drop pollen on the threadlike \"female\" silk that cascades out of each husk. “That tells me in about 10 days or less we’ll probably have sweet corn that is ready to go,” said DeJong. “Typically the last half of July is when the most number of people have sweet corn ready to go.” Farmer Jerimiah Hinz, owner of Castle Creek Family Farms in Newcastle, Nebraska, had a stand at the Sioux City Farmers Market that was chock full of fresh produce. But no sweet corn. Hinz planted an early crop of sweet corn using traditional outdoor methods. The crop failed due to a cool May, he said. After replanting, Hinz estimates his current batch of sweet corn will be ready by August. Last year he had sweet corn by early July. “It’s a little later for me this year,” said Hinz. Siblings Alex Schmitz, 19, and Emma Schmitz, 16, of Schettler Gardens in Carroll, Iowa, said they’ll be ready to sell their corn by the July 18 farmers market. They usually grow about two acres of sweet corn each year. “My grandpa always told me every 10 miles south you get (sweet corn) one day earlier,” said Alex Schmitz. Meanwhile, Hebda said he's not sure if his operation will go the extra mile again next year to have sweet corn for the Fourth of July. Sales were slow this year, a typical problem on a holiday weekend. “People are moving around and they’re not thinking about making a purchase necessarily on (holidays),” Hebda said. Hebda Produce also had to sacrifice the traditional early crop of tomatoes and bell peppers this year for the hothouse sweet corn. It's a trade-off he needs to assess. “When you get to the end of the year, you’ll calculate what you had to give up to have (sweet corn),” said Hebda.",

Although they're certainly not a popular choice, ducks make fun and unique pets. Ducks don't have the reputation for it, but they are intelligent, playful and cuddly. They enjoy playing with toys and can be trained to engage in easy games. Their feed is also relatively cheap, and they are also quite the weed eaters. However, like with any other pet, it's important to consider the commitment a duck requires. Different breeds of ducks have different amounts of energy. They also need to be sheltered from predators, such as foxes, dogs or even cats.",

    "DiffbotBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J. She began working for museums in earnest in 2002 when she became administrator of the Readington museums, where she oversaw three 18th-century buildings depicting Colonial life in New Jersey farming communities. Hollander helped with several restoration efforts and spent a great deal of her time making history accessible to the public. She developed Hands-on History programs centered on themes such as health and hygiene in the Colonial era and traditional crafts such as barrel-making. She would also take on the persona of Vrouw Maritje Bouman, a 36-year-old mother of five in the Colonial era. Donning a white bonnet, embroidered apron and red linen bedjacket, Hollander would tell school groups what life was like in 1755 as she performed daily chores. \"I would show them that I was cooking on a hearth and ask them if they help their moms cook on a hearth,\" she recalled. \"They would say we don't have a hearth. We have a stove. I would ask them what is it? How did it get hot? Wood? Most didn't know, but by asking them questions, if forced them to think about their world.\" Hollander played the part so seriously that a student once stopped her on the street to tell her she looked just like Vrouw Bouman and ask if she was her descendant. \"She got the kids to appreciate history,\" said Margaret Smith, program director at Readington. Hollander kept their attention, she said, through hands-on activities and stories. Hollander left Readington in 2010 when the board made her job part-time and soon after started working at Clinton's Red Mill Village. With 40,000 artifacts and a 10-acre campus along the scenic south branch of the Raritan River, the mill is well suited for exhibits and special events. Hollander tapped that potential, hosting Civil War Days and Revolutionary Days, weekend festivals that featured re-enactors. She also got a quick lesson in crisis management there. The Halloween before she was hired, the nonprofit that runs the mill had transformed the historic spot to the Asylum of Terror, haunted by \"wretched souls\" tormented by \"dementia, paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviors, physical abnormalities and deformities.\" The theme drew criticism from the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma and prompted the National Alliance on Mental Illness to alert the public about the Clinton mill. Mill officials approved a safer \"zombie\" theme the year Hollander came on board and issued a public apology in the newspaper. The board would have left it at that had it not been for Hollander, said Pat Bower, a former mill board member. Hollander reached out to the alliance and the council, creating a history exhibit on how the state had treated the mentally ill. \"She used it as an opportunity to highlight the issue and engage public discussion,\" Bower said. Hollander said some didn't want the exhibit to include the state's mistreatment of the mentally ill and the prejudices held against people with mental illness. But Hollander was insistent that a full story be told, and that the mill was the right place to tell it. \"You can't learn to do things right if you don't recognize the things that happened in the past,\" she said. Hollander left Clinton three years ago for a job as assistant director of communications and outreach at the New Jersey regional office at American Jewish Committee, an advocacy nonprofit. There, she said, she learned about building connections with people and partnerships to advance a cause. Considering just a third of the National Museum of Industrial History's budget will be covered by museum tickets, she said building partnerships — in the form of sponsors, grants and memberships — will be key. She also learned at AJC that history is more significant to people if you can show its impact on people today. She believes she can do that at the National Museum of Industrial History by showing how the machines and innovations that built America continue to have an impact on the world. And here, she'll also have an opportunity to develop programs that inspire the next generation. \"That's where the truly, truly open minds are,\" Hollander said. \"To them, the sky's the limit, anything can happen.\" It takes, she said, just one historical figure, artifact or idea to inspire a future. Just as Grover's Mill did for her.

    "LabBody": "RACINE — In the 1,709 days since a pregnant Caledonia woman overdosed on heroin and died, she missed her younger sister’s graduation and wedding, and the birth of her now 3-year-old son. Her death — coming after a syringe full of heroin was administered by her ex-boyfriend — destroyed their family, said Kattie Vlasak, whose older sister, Sarah Blask, was found dead on Nov. 3, 2010, in her ex-boyfriend’s Racine apartment. “The world lost a little bit of light that day and became darker,” Vlasak said Thursday during that man’s sentencing. “At 21 years old I was forced to plan my sister’s funeral.” Eric P. Gallup, 37, was sentenced to 22 ½ years in prison plus another 7 ½ years on extended supervision in connection with Blask’s death. He was accused more than four years ago of giving Blask, 26, the heroin on which she reportedly overdosed. She was two months pregnant by another man, who was her boyfriend at the time. Gallup was charged the next day with first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree reckless homicide of an unborn child, maintaining a drug-trafficking place and five other drug-related charges, according to court records. He pleaded guilty on May 1 to a downgraded charge of second-degree reckless homicide, and to delivery of heroin. Gallup received the maximum sentence on the homicide charge. Racine County Assistant District Attorney Robert Repischak asked for a prison sentence for Gallup, but per the plea deal, didn’t recommend a specific amount of time to be served. Gallup’s defense attorney, Richard Hart, called for 10 to 12 years behind bars “plus extensive supervision.” While Blask’s death has been hardest on her family, Hart said it has been difficult on Gallup’s family, as well. “Right now his daughter won’t even talk to him. That’s on him,” Hart said. ‘A prison of their own’ Police found Blask on the floor at Gallup’s apartment, covered with a blanket, after they were called to the unit because Blask was unresponsive, according to Gallup’s criminal complaint. There were injuries to her face and blood near the spot where she lay. During his sentencing, Gallup apologized, but said Blask’s family received the wrong account of what happened before she died. However, he did not provide an alternate account, or detail which allegations were incorrect. “I’m guilty. Sarah may have been killed by her addiction, but it was my addiction” that led the pair to use heroin the night before Blask’s death, Gallup said. “I am responsible for feeding my addiction and the choices I have made, and for Sarah’s death. There is no undoing the damage I’ve done.” Circuit Court Judge Michael Piontek acknowledged that no sentence he could impose would bring “peace and serenity” to the families, noting “the victim’s family’s been in a prison of their own.” During the sentencing, her sister said Blask had been clean and sober and was attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. But then she went to Gallup’s apartment to retrieve some personal belongings. Hart disputed that Blask was “clean and sober,” saying she had multiple track marks on her body from drug use, which were “in different stages.” “To be sure, she had her own demons she was dealing with. But she was at a point in her life (where) she was moving toward sobriety,” Repischak said. ‘I hope he rots’ Jail records show Gallup has been in the Racine County Jail since Blask’s death. Piontek granted him credit for the more than 4 ½ years already spent behind bars. After the sentencing, Hart said “it’s very unlikely” Gallup will appeal. “We anticipated (the sentence) was going to be very close to that, so I am not surprised,” he said. Vlasak, 26, now of Charlotte, North Carolina, said she felt grateful that Piontek “expedited this and he really cared about the victims,” but as for Gallup, “I hope he rots.” “It’s hard to describe how you feel when someone’s being sentenced for something so horrible. Obviously I think he deserves to be thrown away for life,” she said sitting on a bench outside the courtroom. “I hope we can move forward in our lives and find some happiness.”",

You can pack light or you can wear as many articles of clothing you have to avoid superfluous luggage and those pesky, pesky fees. That's what one member of the boyband Rewind did... and then he passed out while doing so. So yes, boybands are still a thing and this one is named Rewind. Don’t feel bad if you’ve never heard of them, you’re not alone.. In any case, the members of the five-piece man ensemble were heading from Essex to Glasgow. One of the boys, 19-year-old James McElvar, wanted to avoid a £45 (that's about $70) charge for having too many bags, so he put on 12 layers of clothing — 12 LAYERS! Is that three pairs of pants in your pocket or are you just happy to see us? \"The woman said either one bag went in the hold or we weren't getting on,” McElvar told The Sun. “The rest of the band had gone through so I couldn't give them any of the clothes. I was told I’d either have to pay a £45 fee to get it on the plane, get the flight the next morning, bin the clothes or wear them.\" Here's the roster of clothing he put on: six T-shirts, five sweaters, three pairs of jeans, two sweat pants, two jackets and two hats. There's nothing sexier than a boyband member in layers and layers of clothing. Eventually, McElvar \"became violently ill and suffered a fit\" with \"an off-duty paramedic treat[ing] him as passengers looked on.” He said that he felt like he was going to have a heart attack. Luckily, he survived and the band Rewind will live on. They made sure to tweet the news to put their fans at ease. So happy that they are safe and sound. Now all the world will not be void of their awesome songs... whatever they are.",

The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

    "DiffbotBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway. Separately, P\u0026G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P\u0026G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P\u0026G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P\u0026G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter \u0026 Gamble shareholders could exchange P\u0026G shares for shares of Coty. P\u0026G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P\u0026G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P\u0026G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P\u0026G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P\u0026G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P\u0026G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. “This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,” Lafley said. “We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.” Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P\u0026G’s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal “is a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,” said Ali Dibadj, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. “The timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,” Dibadj told me. “Feels a little amateurish in terms of process by P\u0026G.” The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger, an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. “Sales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P\u0026G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,” Strebinger told me. The brands that P\u0026G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P\u0026G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P\u0026G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head \u0026 Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. “Procter \u0026 Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we’d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,” Erin Lash, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. “However, we don’t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.” The beauty category “has remained a challenge for P\u0026G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,” Lash wrote. “We suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.” The other brands included in P\u0026G’s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice \u0026 Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. acted as financial adviser on the transaction, and Cadwalader, Wickersham \u0026 Taft LLP acted as tax counsel. Jones Day acted as legal counsel, and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P\u0026G.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Hype can be a dangerous thing in fantasy football. Sure, it's great to know who this year's rising stars and hot sleepers are. The problem begins when everyone starts reading the same reports. Writing their own takes based on those reports. Targeting the same players based on what they've read and/or written. That, in turn, drives up the asking price of those sleepers and value plays. A running back who was being drafted close to his fantasy floor rises nearer to his ceiling. That late-round lottery ticket wideout goes from $1 scratcher to one of those big, shiny ones that cost 20 bucks. In 2014, everyone and their mother (hi Mom!) were convinced that San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green was going to take the reins from Antonio Gates. Green's Average Draft Position rose steadily throughout the summer, to the point he was drafted ahead of the future Hall of Famer. Well, Gates caught 12 touchdowns and finished as a top-five tight end in most scoring systems. Green caught 19 passes all season long. With that cautionary tale in mind, here are a handful of players for whom hype levels are redlining in 2015. Begin Slideshow » Average Draft Position: QB4 (37th overall) I will be the first person to admit that I'm an unabashed fan of Seattle Seahawks quarterback . My admiration for him as a player borders on man-crush levels. And Wilson is coming off a phenomenal season, both from an NFL and fantasy football perspective. Wilson set career highs in passing yards (3,475), rushing yards (849) and rushing touchdowns (six) en route to leading the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Wilson also posted the best fantasy finish of his three-year career, finishing fifth at his position in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. With Wilson headed into the final year of his rookie deal, there has been speculation that Wilson could be set to become the highest-paid player in NFL history. Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated might not be willing to go quite that far, but you'll get no argument from him that Wilson's worth a whole lotta money: Is Russell Wilson a franchise quarterback? I would posit that the answer lies somewhere between “Yes” and “Well, duh... of course he is.” He's accomplished things no other quarterback has accomplished through his first three seasons, and while he's had a lot of help, the Seahawks weren't going to win all those games and reach the Super Bowl twice with Tarvaris Jackson, Charlie Whitehurst or Matt Flynn under center. Wilson's asking price has gone way up in fantasy drafts as well. A player who was barely being drafted as a weekly starter a year ago is now going ahead of Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints. And that's no bueno. As things stand right now, fantasy owners are counting on Wilson bettering last year's career stats just to justify his asking price. Not exceed, mind you—justify. And this is a quarterback for the team that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL in 2014. Yes, much of Wilson's fantasy production is tied to his ability to hurt teams with his legs. But consider this—assuming that the Seahawks and Wilson do agree to an extension, do you think the team that just invested well over $100 million in Wilson is going to want him to carry the ball 118 times in 2015? Wilson's a great young player and a fine fantasy option. But with a top-five sticker price? Pass. Average Draft Position: RB20 (44th overall) You aren't going to get any argument that Todd Gurley is a talented, young running back. You won't get much that he's the best rookie ball-carrier to come down the pipe in some time. Mike Mayock of the NFL Network lauded the Rams' selection of Gurley with the No. 10 overall pick, comparing the 6'1\", 221-pounder to Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks: I like the Marshawn Lynch comparison. St. Louis wants to win games the same way that Seattle and San Francisco do in the same division, that is by running the football and playing great defense and special teams. Gurley has Olympic-type speed. I love this pick for St. Louis, which already has a great defense and Gurley will help out Nick Foles. It would appear that fantasy owners agree. Last year, Bishop Sankey of the Tennessee Titans was chosen as the first rookie running back in fantasy drafts, with an average draft position at My Fantasy League of RB25. Gurley is coming off the board a full five slots higher, ahead of veterans like Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers and Joique Bell of the Detroit Lions. There's just one problem—one huge, glaring problem. Gurley tore his ACL last November while at Georgia. Yes, the recovery time for such an injury isn't what it used to be. And reports from Rams' camp have been almost universally positive. However, even if Gurley is ready to rock for Week 1, as Thomas Emerick of Sporting News points out, we're likely to see a lot of second-year pro Tre Mason, at least early in the season: Fisher's approach to managing Gurley's workload will set the ceiling for September and October, where we'll probably see a snap limit and heavy dose of Mason. Gurley owners will hope this step takes place in August. St. Louis also drafted four desperately needed offensive linemen, and this run offense will depend on a young line jelling together and finding starters by fire. With Mason in the fold, there's no reason for the Rams to rush Gurley. And yet he's being drafted like a Week 1 bell cow. Those who pull that trigger better hope it turns out better than Sankey in 2014. Average Draft Position: WR16 (41st overall) There may not be a more hyped player in all of fantasy football than New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Keith Lipscomb of ESPN was one of any number of pundits who have gushed about Cooks' potential as the new No. 1 receiver in the Big Easy: I think the Saints are going to turn up the volume in Cooks' game in his sophomore season. In his first five games, he averaged just 4.1 yards at the catch (how far downfield he caught the ball), but in his final five games before his injury, that number was 12.0. You know the Saints still want to throw the football but don't have their top-two pass-catchers from last season. Cooks is a dynamic talent, and this season he'll get every opportunity to show the masses, including more chances to make plays down the field. It isn't just fantasy types, either. Chris Wesseling of NFL.com also wrote that Cooks could be on the verge of a breakout in his second NFL season: Now that Jimmy Graham and Kenny Stills have been shipped off to Seattle and Miami, respectively, there could be as many as 175-200 targets up for grabs in the Saints' aerial attack. With only a declining Marques Colston ahead of him in the pecking order, Cooks is sure to be a featured player after dominating offseason practices. And it's possible that breakout could happen. Cooks showed himself to be dangerous in the open field last year before a broken thumb ended his season, and with both Stills and especially Graham gone, someone is going to have to pick up the slack. The problem is that with all the buzz surrounding Cooks, his ADP has been steadily climbing. A player with one season of 550 receiving yards is being taken as a high-end fantasy WR2. And for Lipscomb's colleague Field Yates, that cost is just too high: There's a lot to like about Brandin Cooks' game, as he's shifty, elusive and a menace to tackle in open space. But he plays a position -- slot receiver -- that isn't often conducive to finding the end zone frequently. He's slotted as our 16th wide receiver, but I simply think the lack of touchdowns will be an issue from a fantasy perspective. The issue isn't even Cooks per se. It's the hype that's sucked all the value from a player now being drafted far closer to his fantasy ceiling than the floor. Average Draft Position: TE6 (75th overall) OK, so \"hype\" may not exactly be the best word to describe the buzz surrounding Julius Thomas, especially in fantasy circles. In fact, he needs a hug. Evan Silva's comments about Thomas over at Yahoo Sports more-or-less sum up the fantasy community's feelings about Thomas moving to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency this year: Julius Thomas was easily the biggest fantasy \"loser\" of this year's free agency period, going from a Broncos offense that ranked first and second in the NFL in scoring in 2013 and 2014, to a Jags team that finished 32nd and 32nd in those seasons. While Thomas may prove a useful real-life pickup for Jacksonville, the bottom could fall out on his fantasy production. I told you he needed a hug. Although that $9 million a season the Jaguars forked over probably makes the 27-year-old feel a little bit better. If I need to explain to you why going from the fantasy penthouse that is Peyton Manning in Denver to the fantasy outhouse that is Jacksonville and Blake Bortles, then might I recommend fantasy bowling? I hear fantasy cricket is—whatever happens during a cricket jiminy or whatever it's called. And yet Thomas is still being selected sixth at the tight end spot on average. That's ahead of Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles, who could be set for a big uptick in targets this year. Ahead of Jordan Cameron of the Miami Dolphins, who has the added advantage of an honest-to-goodness NFL quarterback throwing him passes in Ryan Tannehill. And far ahead of veteran Owen Daniels, who replaced Thomas in Denver. Have these people seen Bortles and the Jaguars play? Average Draft Position: D/ST1 (68th overall) From an NFL perspective, there's no arguing that the Seattle Seahawks have one of the NFL's very best defenses. In 2014, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. The year before, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. Scoring defense? First in 2014. First in 2013. Two years ago, all was well. The Seahawks also ranked fourth in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. Not great, but nothing to cry about. Last year? Tears galore. The Seahawks free-fell to 23rd. The change was brought about by big plays—or more appropriately, the lack of them. The Seahawks dropped from eighth in the NFL in sacks two seasons ago to 20th in 2014. In 2013, the Seahawks ranked fourth in takeaways. Last year, that number plummeted to 21st. Yes, those numbers could rebound in 2015. Or not. It's not as if the Seahawks made big upgrades to the pass rush in the offseason, and turnovers are a fluky stat. Spending a sixth-round pick (in a 12-team fantasy football league) on any team defense isn't advisable. Spending one on a fantasy defense (that finished outside the top 20 a year ago) because it's a great NFL defense is even worse. It's falling for the hype.

She looks amazing and would bring a more exotic touch to Dior if she were to be chosen as brand ambassador. Getty There's no denying Denise Bidot is gorgeous, and this Latina has a classic elegance to her that could perfectly fir Dior's standards. And, if she were to be a Dior girl, not only would she be the first Latina, but she would also be the first plus size model to be part of the fashion house. Getty Rihanna has yet another accomplishment under her belt. The Barbadian beauty is the latest ambassador for Dior, making her the first black woman to be the face of such iconic fashion house.

Sure enough, they are breaking that record yet again. In 2011, they achieved the record by shooting a basket from 66.89 meters (219 feet) above the hoop and then in 2013, increased the record to 91.1 meters (299 feet). This time, they chose to shoot the ball from atop Tasmania's Gordon Dam at 140 meters (459 feet) and well, the rest is history. Essentially, they made this shot from atop the equivalent of a 46-story building. No telling how many attempts it took them, but the bottom line is that they eventually made it and have the world record to prove it.",

    "LabBody": "Though we missed the ferry with a planned Morrissey interview in today's GO! (we were advised the enigmatic singer might, just might, be agreeable to a Q\u0026A via email), we'd still like to mark his ultra-rare Central Illinois appearance someway, somehow. At the very least, he has his own well-traveled avenue here in Bloomington ... more than most single-moniker Brit-born pop stars can claim, right? Speaking of more than most: as one source (the U.K.'s Independent) respectfully/famously observed, “most pop stars have to be dead before they reach the iconic status he has reached in his lifetime.” With that unique and enviable status in mind, we can't say we were surprised when the emailed Q\u0026A didn't happen, even after the “might” bait was dangled. Anyway, as far as we can determine, Saturday night's concert at the Bloomington Center for the Performing Arts (8:30 p.m., tickets still available) is Morrissey's first downstate performance since the man born Stephen Patrick Morrissey 56 years ago embarked on his solo career, circa 1988 ... a sobering 27 years ago. Of his other main career incarnation, with alt rock band the Smiths (1982-87), again we can locate no evidence of a prior Central Illinois visitation. The storied Brit-pop band was mainly the creation of Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, who were the band's contentiously creative Lennon and McCartney over a storied four-album run (\"The Smiths,\" \"Meat Is Murder,\" \"The Queen Is Dead,\" \"Strangeways, Here We Come\"). True confessions: Our first Smiths awareness came to us fairly late, courtesy busy Brat Pack guru John Hughes, the Chicago filmmaker who could always be counted on to lard his teen-friendly soundtracks with the best in cutting-edge '80s pop. Hughes clearly liked Morrissey and the Smiths, witness his usage of \"Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want\" twice in a year: in the \"museum scene\" of 1986's \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (Ferris \u0026 Co. at large in the Art Institute of Chicago) and as Jon Cryer's (Duckie's) theme song in \"Pretty in Pink\" (when he's listening to records in his bedroom and dreaming of Miss Pretty herself, Molly Ringwald). Shortly after our introduction to the Smiths, that era was over, just a year after the Hughes soundtracks gave them their highest-profile exposure stateside (despite the universal critical rep, the band was never a chart-buster here). Then came the solo Morrissey, whose persona since has always remained slightly out of focus for us, which is why we're happy to go with that catch-all descriptive for the artists we don't fully get ... enigmatic. When it comes to expressing the 50 shades of gray moods, though, we submit he has few equals ... a true poet of misery whose way around a tortured lyric knows few equals. He hasn't been christened \"The Pope of Mope\" for nothing. The Smiths, to be sure, were no strangers to the abyss, with such bitter pills as \"Girlfriend in a Coma,\" \"I Know It's Over\" and \"Unhappy Birthday\" — the latter infamous for dishing up the most dismissive greeting in pop music annals, riddled with threats of suicide, killing the pet dog and promises not to cry even if the birthday girl dropped dead tomorrow. The morbidity and dark moods followed Morrissey into his post-Smith years, though made more personal via his move to a solo forum, where he seemed to take everything further to a heart routinely pierced by life's slings and arrows. That stance can be summed up by our favorite bad-karma Morrissey musing, a little ode to despair called \"Satan Rejected My Soul,\" from the deep well of 1997's \"Maladjusted\" album. \"Satan rejected my soul, he knows my kind, he won't be dragged down. As low as he goes, he never quite goes this low.\" That's pretty deep down into the abyss, by any measure. On those terms, though, practically nobody does it better, and with a greater sense of fully knowing whereof he mopes. Craft is Pantagraph arts and entertainment editor.

    "DiffbotBody": "A joint letter sent by human rights groups to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of enhanced interrogation techniques revealed by a Senate report released late last year. The letter, signed by Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International, asked Lynch’s office to investigate “torture and other violations of U.S. law” in connection to the programs. A petition with 111,788 signatures was attached to the joint letter. In the six months since the Senate report was released, the letter says, the Obama administration hasn’t taken any steps to criminally investigate the interrogation practices. “The Justice Department has a clear responsibility to carry out a credible and comprehensive criminal investigation into the overwhelming evidence that U.S. officials used torture in violation of U.S. law,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a press release. “The Obama administration’s continued failure to act in the face of this mountain of evidence risks sending the message that torture is a valid policy option rather than the crime that it is.” The Department of Justice, in a statement provided to International Business Times, said that it looked into the programs in both 2009 and again after the torture report was released. \"In 2009, the Attorney General directed a preliminary review of the treatment of certain individuals alleged to have been mistreated while in U.S. Government custody subsequent to the 9/11 attacks. That review generated two criminal investigations, but the Department of Justice ultimately declined those cases for prosecution because the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain convictions beyond a reasonable doubt,\" a spokesman said in an email. \"Those investigators have also reviewed the Senate Committee’s full report and did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination. This inquiry was extraordinarily thorough and we stand by our previously announced decision not to initiate criminal charges.\" The Senate report, released in December, detailed a program that began soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. An initial memo authorized the CIA with considerable discretion over whom to detain in intelligence-gathering operations. From there, and through subsequent memos, the CIA and U.S. intelligence operations were able to establish secret detention centers. Under the rationale that the combatants captured in the war on terror were not protected as prisoners of war under the Geneva convention, a set of so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding were used to force information from prisoners. The interrogation techniques were discontinued through executive action soon after President Barack Obama took office. The report set off a heated public debate, and critics of the program pointed to scant evidence that the interrogation techniques, which were often characterized as torture, had led to significant, reliable intelligence. Earlier this month, the Senate voted to ban waterboarding and \"rectal feeding,\" which would permanently extend Obama’s executive order. “We must continue to insist that the methods we employ in this fight for peace and freedom must always, always, be as right and honorable as the goals and ideals we fight for,” said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a former of prisoner of war. The torture ban was part of a bigger National Defense Authorization Act that the Senate ultimately passed overwhelmingly. A final version of the bill could be passed in early July.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With Microsoft making significant layoffs in its phone business this week, it seems to outsiders like an uncharacteristic misstep. How did the tech giant misunderstand the mobile market so badly? As CEO Satya Nadella pulls the company away from unprofitable ventures launched by predecessor Steve Ballmer, it’s worth taking a look at some of the other major blunders that have hit the company. Did you know Microsoft made an MP3 player? Or that Windows Vista’s development was going so badly at one point that they hit the reset button? And that's just the beginning. Nokia With Nokia one of the few companies actually making Windows phones, Microsoft officials were a bit spooked that Nokia might switch platforms and move into the Android camp. Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analysis, explains that Microsoft paid a “strategy tax” by buying Nokia’s devices division in 2013 to make sure the hardware existed to run its software. “Why Microsoft paid over $7 billion for a money-losing business is mind-boggling, but what really hurt was the timing: Microsoft paid the strategy tax after Windows had already lost the mobile platform fight,” Greengart said. Tablet PC Nokia wasn’t the first time Microsoft pushed into the mobile sphere, nor was the iPad the first tablet computer. No, the snappily named Windows XP Tablet PC Edition helped define what Microsoft saw as the future of computing: computers that were more like books, except they had pens and you could touch the screens. The company had eight years between launching the tablet PC and the iPad arriving, and in that time hardware improved, laptops got lighter, and operating systems became more streamlined. None of that mattered in the end. Microsoft had fundamentally misunderstood how people would use tablets, and the iPad set the world alight from the word go. Zune Remember the Zune? If so, you’re one of the few who do. Five years after the iPod came out, Microsoft finally decided it had an answer to Apple’s runaway success. Available at launch in black, white and, er…brown, the Zune had some interesting features like Wi-Fi and a marginally bigger screen to set it apart from the iPod video. None of that mattered, and the launch of the iPhone a few months later did little to help. In 2009, three years after launching, it had a 2 percent share of the market according to NPD. The company finally pulled the plug in June 2012. Ad Tech In 2007, Microsoft decided it was time to jump into another industry it had waited far too long to join. And so it was advertising’s turn, an industry dominated in the online sphere by Google, with Microsoft buying aQuantive in 2007 to make its entry. In 2012, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion write-down on its ad tech investments. In 2013, the company sold Atlas Solutions, part of the aQuantive buyout, to Facebook. The Q4 2014 financial results showed display ads made up 15 percent of total ad revenue, and sure enough last month Microsoft finally pulled the plug. Windows Vista Vista started off life in May 2001 as “Longhorn,” named after a bar at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort. “Whistler” and “Blackcomb” were the codenames for Windows XP and 7, respectively, with “Longhorn” intended as a stopgap release for 2003. Over time, Blackcomb features made their way into Longhorn, and more and more ideas were thrown into the mix. At the same time, Microsoft was doubling down on security updates for XP, pulling resources from Longhorn. In August 2004 it was clear Microsoft had no idea what the plan was, so they started over. Vista finally launched in January 2007, more than five years after XP. It was the longest timespan between releases, cost $6 billion, and was replaced by Windows 7 in around half the time it took Vista to arrive. Windows 8 Unfortunately, the Windows success would soon slip away again. Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows division, was able to implement his vision of how Windows should be. It should work with touchscreen interfaces, kickstart a new app ecosystem and set out bold new ideas. Turns out, enterprise users don’t care about any of that stuff, and consumers don’t want touchscreen controls for their keyboard and mouse. Microsoft was disappointed by sales, and even today Windows 8.1 has a market share of 13.12 percent (compared to 60.98 percent for Windows 7), according to NetMarketshare. Sinofsky, CEO Steve Ballmer’s most likely successor, was eventually forced out in November 2012. Satya Nadella instead took over from Ballmer in 2014, and the rest is history.",

An opening reception will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday, July 11, at the Museum. Admission to the reception is free and the public is invited. “Oral, visual and written communication has changed in unimaginable ways. The exhibit takes the visitor from cave drawings to the present,” said Joe Vidales, interim director. We communicate to tell a story and to document or share an event. The exhibit includes artifacts and period clothing from the Museum’s collection. Telephones from the early 1900s, the 1940s, and the 1950s, part of the Museum’s collection, are evidence of how our communication has changed. We do not use such phrases as: “This is a collect call.” “I want to make a person-to-person call.” “I’d like to place a long distance call.” Strange-looking typewriters from the 1930s, to the electric typewriters, to the desk-top computer are witness to the evolution of written communication. Besides talking face-to-face, we have used two tin cans and a string, transistor radios, a Walkman, and the modern iPod. The exhibit will include floor-model radios and radios dating from the 1930s and 1940s. Practically all of today’s photography is digital technology. Cameras of the past required that we buy film and then take the pictures. If we did not forget about the film in the camera, the film was then taken to a store for processing and to have copies made. The digital age allows for instant images and instant sharing through the various social media websites. The Weslaco Museum, located at 500 S. Texas Blvd., is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday. Regular admission is free to members, $4 for adults, $3 for seniors, $2 for veterans, $2 for students, ages 5 to 17, and free to children under five. The Weslaco Museum has free admission on the first Saturday of each month and for special programs. For more information, call the museum at (956) 968-9142.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With just one former winner in this year’s field, the 2015 Home Run Derby is likely to have a first-time champion. A few days before this year’s contest, the runner-up in the 2014 Derby is the favorite to win the title during MLB's All-Star break. Todd Frazier (7/2) has been given the best betting odds at Bovada.lv to win the competition, leading the rest of the contestants. The Cincinnati Reds third baseman was a longshot to win the title last year, but he made it all the way to the finals, falling to back-to-back champion Yoenis Cespedes. After hitting a career-high 29 home runs in 2014, Frazier has emerged as one of MLB’s top power hitters. His 25 home runs are the second-most of any player in the 2015 Derby, and he tails Giancarlo Stanton by just two home runs for the Major-League lead. Kris Bryant (5/1) is the second favorite, even though he has fewer home runs than any other contestant this season. He’s one of just two players in the field that doesn’t have at least 16 home runs and rank no worse than 21st in the Majors. The Chicago Cubs rookie has 12 dingers, though he didn’t start the season in the big leagues. He’s averaging a home run in nearly every 23 at-bats. The only contestant that’s won the competition before is Prince Fielder (11/2), having taken home the trophy in both 2009 and 2012. He’s having one of his worst home-run seasons of his career with just 13 long balls, but the designated hitter has been terrific for the Texas Rangers in 2015. His .345 batting average is second in the American League, and only Frazier and Bryant have better odds to win the Derby. Albert Pujols (6/1) is the AL leader with 26 home runs, topping every other contestant. He’s competed in the event three times, never winning and having his best finish 12 years ago when he came in second place behind Garrett Anderson. Chicago is the only team that has two representatives in the contest. Bryant has better odds than Anthony Rizzo (13/2), even though the first baseman has hit four more home runs than his teammate. Joc Pederson, Josh Donaldson and Manny Machado are all tied for having the worst odds (7/1) of anyone in Monday’s competition. Pederson has 20 home runs and he's a leading candidate, along with Bryant, to be named the National League Rookie of the Year. Donaldson has 21 home runs, and he’s in the conversation for AL MVP. Machado’s 19 home runs are already a career-high. Along with Frazier, Donaldson competed in last year’s Home Run Derby. He didn’t make it out of the first round, hitting just three long balls. Giancarlo Stanton, Mike Trout and Bryce Harper are among the notable names that won't be in the 2015 Derby.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The trio of brothers running Sunshine Market in Lynnwood, at the corner of 212th Street SW and 44th Avenue W, are serious about their fruits and vegetables.They stand behind their products, support local farmers and try to be there for their customers nearly every day of the year, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and until 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, said Noor Almtowaq, 29. And they'll stay open later if a customer drives in at closing time, he said.He's the eldest brother and the driving force behind the purchase of the stand, which they opened in September 2013.“Noor's the heart of the entire business,” said 26-year-old Alex.Yet Noor now works at Microsoft, finding time mainly on weekends and some nights for Sunshine Market, and it's Alex who's hooked on produce.“He has so much passion for the business,” said younger brother Josh, 22. “It's like he fell in love with produce.”Alex agreed and said he's not likely to fall out of love anytime soon either. In fact, he's searching for a site for a second, bigger store where he can expand the selection. He dreams of a string of stores offering both conventional and organic produce. He said there's a science to understanding how fruits and vegetables work — “for example, potatoes hate light, bananas love heat, asparagus loves water” — and in understanding how to sell produce.“When you put tomatoes, basil, eggplants and ginger next to each other,” he said, “it's a guarantee you're going to sell them all.”He's always been interested in how things work. Younger brother Josh said Alex was the kind of kid who was forever taking things apart and putting them back together. He studied at Edmonds Community College and earned an engineering degree from the University of Washington, because he wanted to understand the technology behind materials like concrete.“I'm an inventor and my imagination was limited because I didn't understand the materials, so it limited me,” Alex said. Understanding materials “grew my imagination,” he said.The brothers didn't start out planning to go into the produce business.“I didn't even know what cilantro was, to be honest,” Josh said.Prodded by Noor, they were just looking for a business. And they liked the Lynnwood location. Perched on a hilltop at a busy intersection with three corners anchored in Mountlake Terrace, the site overlooks a Lynnwood business district and streets leading to the Alderwood Mall and I-5. It's housed a produce stand at various times in the past, as well as a coffee stand, sometimes both at once. But there were few, if any, improvements to the building and nothing seemed to last for long. That changed when the Almtowaq brothers took over the site. It was Alex who almost singlehandedly rebuilt the building, doing everything the city would let him do by himself. He redid the electrical and plumbing, built the shelves and an awning for shade. He installed new siding and garage doors that can slide up to open an entire side of the building. “He built this whole entire building all by himself,” Josh said. “He's really smart. I used to come down and watch him.”Todd Hall, planning manager for the City of Lynnwood community development, said the brothers made “significant modifications” to the building and their business is apparently running smoothly.“Since they've come in, we haven't had any complaints or anything,” Hall said. “It seems to be going really well.”The brothers said they made a lot of mistakes and their first customers didn't expect Sunshine Market to last long.At first, they didn't have proper coolers and their produce wasn't being sprayed with water to keep it fresh. So Alex installed coolers and bought the software for a state-of-the-art sprinkler system. “My spinach now lasts two weeks,” he said. “I won't leave it in the store two weeks, but it lasts two weeks. When I first opened, I couldn't even get it to last three days.”Customer Kainitra Crammer, who lives in Bothell but works near Sunshine Market, said she loves the freshness of the produce. She can put it in her fruit bowl and it won't attract fruit flies because it's not spoiling right away, she said. “It's not the grocery store's produce,” she said, “and you can clearly tell, because of the way it lasts.”The brothers order from independent local farmers and smaller outfits like Peterson Fruit Co., a family-owned business in Mukilteo. Often it's a customer request that brings a new product into the store. That's how the brothers started carrying raw milk from Jackie's Jersey Milk in Bellingham. They started out selling 18 bottles a week and now sell 90.They also sell fresh goat milk, which is even harder to find; theirs comes from Lucky Hook Farm in Moses Lake.“People drive from like, Arlington and stuff, just to come buy it,” Josh said.They also sell organic eggs from Stiebrs Farms in Yelm, fresh every three days, he said. And duck eggs, which he described as “a very rich egg” beloved by Asians. Another big seller is their raw honey, purchased from a beekeeper with 46 beehives ranging from Mill Creek to Walla Walla, Josh said.“It is like, the best honey out there,” he said, adding, “We believe 110 percent in our honey.”There are also familiar items like chocolate milk from Twin Brooks Creamery in Lynden, coconut water, Bulgarian feta cheese and Beechers Cheese. Other jarred and canned products give a nod to the brothers' Middle Eastern roots. There's olive oil from Lebanon and Tunisia, coriander from Pakistan, Turkish figs, dolmas and cornichons, tahini paste and dates.Although they consider themselves Americans, the brothers fled with their family from Iraq in 1992, in the wake of the first Gulf War. Aided by Red Cross and United Nations workers after crossing into Saudi Arabia, the Almtowaqs made their way to Washington state, living in Everett for a time and then Lynnwood. His family history may explain in part why Alex has studied philosophy and history and seems just as prone to discussing Plato, Socrates and Galileo as he is to talking produce.Indeed, the conversation at Sunshine Market seems to be part of the customer service.“One of the coolest things here is being able to meet with the brothers,” said store regular Doug Clark, maneuvering through the market in his wheelchair. “And since I'm disabled, they actually have excellent customer service.”He's also partial to the produce, he said.“I've gone up to the Yakima fruit stand, just to compare prices and quality,” he said, “and I just turned around and came back here.”Retired media-arts teacher Claire Beach, of Edmonds, called Alex's impassioned explanations his “TED talks,” referring to the short, powerful talks made popular by the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences.She chatted with Alex on a recent visit, but that didn't distract her from the produce, which she said has helped her recover from a serious illness. She's been following an anti-inflammatory diet, including cutting down on carbs, and has lost 40 pounds and regained her vigor, she said.“This is the first time in my life I'm eating what my body wants,” said Beach, adding that she grew up in the South. “I was raised in Betty Crocker Land.”Customers like Beach are inspiring, Alex said.“When people come back and they tell you they feel better, healthier, stronger — it's a good feeling,” he said. “It keeps you going.”He could be making a lot more money as an engineer, but said he doesn't like sitting behind a desk.“Engineering is a hobby,” he said. “It's something I do because I love it.“But selling produce is different. You're selling something that feeds the entire world.”",

    "LabBody": "RACINE COUNTY — Darlene Burchell used to watch house and car fires on the news with her husband, Larry, at their Yorkville house, always hoping aloud that they would never die like that, fearing the pain of a fire. Her fears became reality when Larry Burchell died after his truck started on fire after a crash on May 24. “You talk about all that stuff, and then I’ll be darned, it happens,” said Darlene Burchell, Larry’s wife of 51 years. Larry Burchell’s death is one of the 13 motor vehicle fatalities that have struck the county so far this year. After three motor vehicle fatalities happened in five days last week, the vehicle-related deaths so far in 2015 surpassed Racine County’s average of 12 vehicle fatalities per year over the previous five years. “This was just, as medical examiner, the first time I’ve experienced this many fatalities in this short amount of time that involved motor vehicles or motorcycles,” said Racine County Medical Examiner Michael Payne. On June 21, Father’s Day, two fathers lost their lives in a Downtown crash. Then, a collision between a semi-truck and motorcyclist on Thursday, killing Maximiliano Penaloza Ferreira, 20, of Racine, pushed the county above the average. That collision also adds to what Payne calls a “disturbing” number of motorcyclist fatalities this year. Above average. The average number of motor vehicle deaths the county experienced throughout a year is 12, based on Wisconsin Department of Transportation data from 2010-2014. With a half year left, Racine County could surpass the 14 motor vehicle deaths that happened throughout 2014. Payne said he was concerned by the number of motor vehicle deaths in the past six months, citing the weather and upcoming holidays as possibilities for collisions. Motorcyclists will still take to the roads for the three remaining months of good weather, Payne said, and then snow and ice will offer different traffic hazards. “I guess I have to be the pessimist here,” Payne said. “I would expect those numbers to go up before the end of the year, unfortunately.” Capt. Thomas Lamke of the Racine County Sheriff’s Office said the year’s statistics so far stand out because it follows a year of few fatalities statewide. “Even the low number we had last year, (fatalities) are concerning especially if they’re things that are preventable,” said Lamke, who also serves on the county’s Traffic Safety Commission. As of June 21, the entire state had seen 239 fatalities, compared to the 188 fatalities that occurred by June 21, 2014. This year’s year-to-date accident report outnumbers Wisconsin’s five-year average by 20, according to Wisconsin Department of Transportation data. Motorcycle deaths. The first nice spring day was tainted for Payne when he heard about the first motorcycle accident of the year. Riders take to the road when the weather is mild, so motorcycle incidents occur more frequently in those months, Payne said. “I remember walking up to my house and thinking ‘Wow, what a beautiful day,’ and a couple hours later I got called to my office,” Payne said. At five fatalities, motorcycle crashes nearly outnumbered all other types of vehicle crashes, including car and truck collisions, Payne said. In comparison, there were three motorcycle deaths in the county last year, Payne said. In addition, this year there was a fatal accident involving an ATV. This year, the county also saw five deaths related to cars and trucks, and two pedestrian deaths from one incident, according to Payne’s fatality data. Head injuries are a major source of vehicle-related deaths, especially among motorcyclists, Payne said. Even with a helmet, motorcyclists have no way of protecting their necks, and a spinal cord injury can result in death. “The same type of fender-bender that someone in a car could walk away from can be fatal to a motorcyclist,” Payne said. Seeking common factors. Adverse weather can also cause fatal accidents. Heavy snow and ice contributed to two deaths that occurred in January, he said. Fatal accidents in the county appear to occur just as frequently on rural roads as they do on urban roads, Payne said. The county’s Traffic Safety Commission evaluates the county’s fatal crashes four times a year to see if there are similarities in crash sites or circumstances. Occasionally the commission will change road rules, or it will come up with ideas for public-safety campaigns. A majority of the deaths to motorcyclists this year occurred after a driver in a larger vehicle made a left turn and collided with a motorcycle, according to Payne. Because motorcycles are harder to see and afford less protection to their riders, Payne said he hopes drivers and motorcyclists exercise more caution on the roads. “Especially with a motorcycle, it’s a smaller object, it’s not like a car grill with two headlights coming at you,” Payne said. The Traffic Safety Commission also is concerned about drivers taking their eyes away from the road, due to use of cellphones and GPS behind the wheel. Distracted driving is a major concern for Darlene Burchell, after her husband died from a collision reportedly involving an inattentive driver who fell asleep. Burchell’s dog has stopped waiting for her playmate, Larry, to toss the ball to her. “People have been warned over and over and over again ... they just don’t think they’re ever going to kill anybody.”",

A new car cost $1,900, gasoline was 23 cents a gallon and rents averaged $87 a month. It was 1955. On July 17 of that year — a year in which the last occupying troops left Austria and the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series — Disneyland opened its doors. If the first day was any indicator of its future, we might have expected Walt Disney's amusement park to fade into oblivion, much like Georgia Gibbs' No. 1 Billboard hit \"Dance With Me Henry\" did. (Quick, hum a few bars.) The chaos of Disneyland's debut played out in front of a national television audience, and predictions of epic failure abounded. Sixty years later, we know how wrong those naysayers were. With nearly 17 million annual visitors, Disneyland is the biggest draw in California and among the top tourist destinations in the world. The park's drawing power persuaded Disney to build theme parks in Florida, France, Japan and China. Other amusement parks, such as Denmark's Tivoli Gardens, existed, but Disneyland established a modern theme-park template that has been often duplicated but rarely matched. We think we know Disneyland; after all, we've had 60 years to get acquainted. But do we really? Reporters Christopher Reynolds and Brady MacDonald have compiled a list of 60 things you might not know on the diamond anniversary of the theme park that became the gold standard. 1. Much of Disneyland is built to scale to create the illusion of a full-scale experience. The trains circling the park and the Mark Twain Riverboat are built to 5/8 scale. Sleeping Beauty Castle and the storefronts on Main Street, U.S.A., use forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller. 2. More than a million corn dogs are sold annually at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park. L.A. Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold calls the Disneyland corn dog the best he's ever had. 3. The Rivers of America in Frontierland is 4 to 8 feet deep. The first time the man-made river was filled in 1955, the water seeped through the sandy soil. The riverbed was eventually lined with clay to prevent leaking. 4. The Rivers of America held 6.16 million gallons of water the first time it was filled and lost 30,000 gallons a day to evaporation. 5. Maintenance crews dump 12 pounds of green or brown dye into the water a couple of times a week to color the river. 6. The 8- to 15-foot-tall berm that surrounds Disneyland was designed to keep out the real world and keep in the fantasy world. The dirt for the berm came from the excavation of the Rivers of America. Some of the 350,000 cubic yards of excavated dirt was also used to create what would become Tom Sawyer Island. 7. The Disney family crest can be found over the entrance to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The coat of arms was placed above the arch in 1965, about a year before Walt Disney's death. 8. About 84 million Mickey Mouse ears have been sold since 1955. The Mouseketeers first wore the hats in the 1950s on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television show. 9. More than 750 million people have visited Disneyland since opening day. It took just seven weeks for the first million visitors to walk through the gates. Attendance was 3.6 million in 1955-56, its first year of operation. 10. More than 50 scuba divers maintain the water-based attractions and waterways at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. 11. Dream of getting married in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle? You can, but it will set you back $120,000 for an after-hours ceremony. A trip in Cinderella's crystal coach is included, but if you want Mickey and Minnie Mouse to attend, it will cost you an additional $1,425 for a 30-minute visit. 12. Disneyland has a \"jail\" for disruptive guests (Disney-speak for visitors). They're typically held in a security office until Anaheim police arrive. Undercover Disney security officers have been known to watch for shoplifters. 13. No gum is sold at Disney theme parks. Walt Disney didn't want visitors to step in discarded chewing gum. 14. A small lamp remains lighted in the window above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., in memory of Walt Disney. He often stayed overnight in the 500-square-foot apartment during construction of Disneyland. A larger Disney family apartment was later built above New Orleans Square. 15. The apartment above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., includes a dressing area, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a shower. The couches fold out to make additional beds. 16. On opening day, Disneyland contained 800 mostly nonindigenous species of plants from as far away as Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan. 17. More than 12,000 orange trees were removed from the 160-acre plot that became Disneyland. Some of the discarded trees were replanted upside down along the banks of the Jungle Cruise to look like mangrove roots. 18. The route of the Jungle Cruise was laid out with a Jeep outfitted to simulate the length and width of a riverboat. 19. The Mark Twain stern-wheeler, built at a cost of $150,000, was constructed in pieces and assembled at Disneyland. The upper deck was fabricated in Burbank, and the hull was built at a San Pedro shipyard, trucked overnight to the park and lifted by crane into the Rivers of America. 20. Fantasyland's carousel operated at Toronto's Sunnyside Park for decades before being moved to Disneyland in advance of the park's opening. The original carousel featured a menagerie of animals but now has only horses. Additional horses were acquired from other amusement parks. 21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million. 48. In summer 1970, somebody circulated gag fliers proposing a yippie invasion of Disneyland on Aug. 6. On the appointed day, dozens of yippies, or perhaps generic hippies, gathered on Tom Sawyer Island and raised a Viet Cong flag. Management took the rare step of closing the park five hours early, prompting a bold headline (with photos) on the next day's front page of The Times: \"Yippies' Outburst Shuts Disneyland.\" 49. When the park opened, it had both pay and free toilets. Soon after, all bathrooms became free. 50. Walt Disney and author Ray Bradbury were friends. One day at lunch, Bradbury offered to help rebuild Tomorrowland. Disney is said to have replied: \"Ray, it's no use … you're a genius and I'm a genius … after two weeks we'd kill each other!\" Later, Bradbury called it \"the nicest turndown I've ever had.\" 51. By the time It's a Small World opened at Disneyland in 1966, it had already been seen by more than 10 million visitors during its two years at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. 52. Walt Disney had a lot of input into Pirates of the Caribbean, but he died in December 1966, about four months before the ride opened. 53. In 1971, stage psychic the Amazing Criswell predicted that by 1999, Disneyland would be covered by a plastic bubble, its weather controlled by a switch. 54. Though Walt Disney sported a mustache for most of his adult life, Disneyland banned facial hair on its workers from 1957 until 2000, when restrictions were eased. 55. If Disneyland's original $1 adult admission fee had increased in lockstep with the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, today it would be $8.87. Instead, it's $99. (But in the old days, you had to buy ride tickets separately. Now they're included.) 56. In September 1959, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a historic visit to Los Angeles and asked to see Disneyland. His minders first said yes, and then no, after Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker said he couldn't guarantee Khrushchev's safety. \"Why not?\" Khrushchev protested at a public luncheon. \"What is it? Do you have rocket-launching pads there? ... Is there an epidemic of cholera there? … Have gangsters taken hold of the place?\" 57. In Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the Toad Hall library includes these titles: \"For Whom the Toads Croak\" and \"A Tadpole Grows in Brooklyn.\" 58. When it opened in June 1959, Disneyland's monorail was the first daily operating monorail in the Western Hemisphere. 59. Sleeping Beauty Castle is 77 feet tall. Neuschwanstein, the 19th century Bavarian castle that's widely credited as its inspiration, is 213 feet high. (Neuschwanstein, about 80 miles southwest of Munich, Germany, gets 1.4 million visitors yearly.) 60. For height reasons, there's a good chance Mickey Mouse and many other costumed characters are played by female cast members. Male cast members portray the taller characters such as Goofy and Sheriff Woody. Princess characters have strict height requirements: They must be 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall.

The majority judged the word “state” to be at best ambiguous. Chief Justice John Roberts held that the context of the word “state” mattered more than the “most natural reading.” This is the same Justice Roberts who interpreted a “penalty” as a tax to uphold Obamacare’s constitutionality in 2012, in spite of the fact that the lawyer arguing for Obamacare called it a penalty.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "The world is sometimes a difficult place, and sometimes while we suffer in darkness, we wonder if God has left us alone. When you find yourself questioning if God has abandoned you, remember these seven important comforting truths. Difficulties and trials are a part of every traveler's journey in life. Sometimes they make us and other times they break us and piece us together into something different. Either way, we come out of these difficulties a different person than we were when we went in. That is the nature of trials. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Some may turn to God in their difficulties, but what happens when we feel that God has abandoned us and forced us to face the darkness alone? Here are seven things to remember when you feel like God has abandoned you. God loves you God is your father, and He loves you with a love that is perfect and unending. You can trust in that. Because you are His child, He cares for you, watches over you, protects you and even mourns with you. We are put here in families with parents so we can understand the bond between parent and child. That love is only a fraction of the love your Heavenly Father feels for you. In the scriptures we are told that charity never faileth. Charity is pure love, and God's love will never fail you. Learn to love Him too so you can more fully feel His love around you. Sometimes a good cry is necessary Sometimes the anger and hate of the world is so painful that we harden our hearts so we can't feel the pain. The trouble with closing our hearts to pain is that once it's closed, love is also locked out. A good cry can help fix what sometimes needs to be broken. The pain and sorrow of a broken heart leaves spaces that God can fill –- that you can feel. A broken heart allows you to cry over the pain and sorrow of your trials, and allows God's love to heal the broken parts. In order for you to know God is there, you have to be able to feel His presence. God will come to you if you ask Often when we feel abandoned, the last thing we want to do is talk to the one who we feel has betrayed us. When it comes to God, however, the best thing you can do is talk to Him and tell Him how you feel. As your father, He wants to hear from you as often as you are willing to let Him be a part of your life. Not only will God listen to every prayer you speak, but He will come to you every time you ask for Him. He may not answer every prayer exactly the way you would like Him to, and He may not answer them immediately, but He will sit with you and comfort you while you wait. If you want God to walk with you, it's important that you talk to Him. Just ask. God sees the end from the beginning Because we are small human beings in a big world, we are so limited in our ability to see beyond what's right in front of us. God, on the other hand, is a supreme being, the creator of the universe, and more importantly, the creator of us. He knows where you're broken and where you need mending. He also knows the experiences needed to heal you. Each trial is part of the perfecting process so when we stand before Him, we can be our best selves. We do not see what He sees nor can we know what He knows. What we can do is trust that each experience He gives us is given to help us grow, to give us experience and to point us in the direction we need to go. Trust Him. God is a God of goodness Everything that is good comes from God. By the same token, everything that comes from God is good, even the hard things. If God is asking you to walk a certain path, know that it is for your good, for your better understanding and for your learning. God wouldn't require you to do something that was going to damage your soul. He is a God that desires to lift you up and make you better than you are. Sometimes, it is our own choices that put us in situations that are dangerous. When you find yourself in any situation that is not good, get out! God will not be there. God is a God of goodness and you will find Him in places of light. If you want to find God, look for those places of light and walk there. We're not meant to suffer alone Isolation can cause loneliness, discouragement and depression. It can rob people of their hope, their will and their self-worth. Trusted friends, on the other hand, can encourage, support, and ground us. They can guide us through troubled waters, offer a hand to hold and cheer us up when our hearts are heavy. A trusted friend can remind us of who we are and where we want to be. Some have been where we are before and can give us a far better perspective on how to travel safely to the other side. A good friend is God's way of sending an angel. Read: 4 reasons atheists and Christians both need to be extremely concerned about this new study God never abandons His children God is a God of love and a God of light. He is also our true father, a father who will never abandon His children. Although the world's fathers may, at times, fail their children, God is perfect and will never ever fail you. You are his precious, beautiful child and although He may at times test you, He will never, ever forsake you. Of this promise you can be sure. Believe in Him and keep moving forward.",

    "LabBody": "The filmmakers even wrote an updated, texting-centric scene riffing on the original “Vacation” episode in which all of the car’s passengers, including the driver, fall asleep going down the freeway, though it didn't make it into the finished film. There is a also nod to the signature Truckster, which in this version becomes the tricked-out \"Tartan Prancer,\" a kind of James Bond car of misfortune. (The actors spent enough hours in that car that their ersatz lives began merging with their real ones. “When you’re together all the time like that, you kind of become like a real family. We developed a world of our own jokes. Or we pretended not to hear John and Jonathan when they were giving us a note we don’t like,” said Gisondo. Incidentally, his character's bullying--by his younger brother--is another 2015 spin, bringing into the modern era the inter-gender squabbling of the original.) Still, this is an R-rated New Line comedy more than a Phil Lord-Chris Miller postmodern jazz riff. Cow collisions and accidental cesspool dunkings figure prominently. The new \"Vacation\" boasts big set pieces, as in the rafting scene, and lots of red-band humor, via a misunderstanding between father and son over an explicit sex act and a motel stay featuring unexpected bathroom substances. Some of the movie’s broadest moments take place during a detour to the home of Audrey and her comically beefcake husband Stone (Chris Hemsworth, in a rare comedic performance). Stone is an alpha type who gets some of the bigger laughs thanks to—how to put this--a strategically placed prosthetic, awakening fresh questions in Rusty about how his wife regards him. Goldstein and Daley initially wrote \"Vacation\" as a PG-13 script; this was, after all, about a family. But at the time a few comedies with the softer rating had failed, while R-rated comedies were hot. Executives went back to the writers for an R-rated pass. The result is one of the few movies about everyday parents and kids that the former might not want the latter to see. (The 1983 film was an R too but a soft one, and it came out before the creation of the PG-13.) Perhaps the biggest deviation from the original lies in the lead character. Helms offers a different kind of patriarch than Chase — less the smirky schemer and more the sweetheart schlemiel. \"I may be a little similar to Rusty in my own life,\" Helms said. \"I'm the goofy optimist who thinks things can always work out.\" Of the actor’s appeal, Goldstein noted, “There’s a blend of innocence and likability that allows you to empathize with him even when he makes his own problems.” On cue, after shooting wrapped for the day, Helms decided to join a little kayaking expedition. He donned a suit and nose strips and jumped with his vessel into a rushing stream. The kayak promptly capsized, disappearing its pilot and eliciting a momentary where’s-Ed moment of panic among the land-bound crew. 'Fresh' but respectful' Sequels to classic movies bring out the naysayers and the timeline scrutinizers — just ask anyone who worked on \"Terminator Genisys.\" Some \"Vacation\" fans are understandably wary of a movie that invokes the Griswold name but follows the conventions of the modern summer sequel. Chris Bender, a \"Vacation\" producer, noted that \"what we needed to do was be fresh but also respectful. Which was terrifying.\" Indeed, the film's lineage can be its biggest selling point, but also its greatest obstacle. \"Wouldn't it have been funnier if they did something different, like Rusty and Audrey each had families with kids, and they dropped them off with Clark and Ellen, who had to take care of them as grandparents?\" said Barron, the original Audrey, in an interview. \"This just feels like it's repeating the idea of the first movie.\" (That idea has prompted some, including Barron and D'Angelo, to say they think of this as a remake, though New Line and the filmmakers regard it as a sequel.) Barron, who did not appear in the theatrical sequels, expressed frustration she and Hall weren't contacted for roles in the new film. \"It's a little odd that they're moving on like this, saying they're going back to the original but not including the original Audrey or original Rusty,\" the actress said, in comments that highlight the tricky task of updating a classic. Still, the appearance of Chase and D'Angelo will offer continuity to the original, even if their roles are small enough that, as D'Angelo quipped, \"I think I'm the highest paid actress, by line, of anyone in Hollywood this year.\" The rules of narrative have also changed since 1983. The enjoyable slackness of the first film — plot lines digress to nowhere; consequences are non-existent — doesn't really work in today's more structured storytelling world. The filmmakers acknowledge they kept tighter screws on the story than the original, especially in its last act. The new movie also comes at a moment when the idea of an American vacation is changing. A recent 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll found that two-thirds of Americans would gladly trade vacation days for more money, and nearly 70% of Americans under 30 saw checking emails when not at work a reasonable requirement — an attitude that might make the idea of a fancy-free road trip play a little less convincingly than it did 30 years ago. Every generation gets the new version of a classic it deserves, as has often been said of Shakespeare and, lately, “Spider-Man.” The original \"Vacation,\" made by filmmakers who came of age in the '60s and set in a taboo-busting era, had a kind of nihilism about the traditional family. The new movie, made by filmmakers who came of age with Oprah and set in the family-values era, has greater concern for the preservation of a marriage. In that way, \"Vacation\" may be subject to a criticism about today's R-rated comedies: for all their gross-out humor, they are actually culturally less subversive than their predecessors. The filmmakers say it's a label they're happy to wear. \"There are inherently emotions that are going on in a road trip. The original was about undermining those emotions and sentimentality, and even the family unit,\" Goldstein said. \"Our movie is a little different. We didn't want to shy away from making a movie about a marriage that's not where it should be and someone setting out to fix it.\" Added Daley, \"What's changed since the comedies of the '80s is that audiences do appreciate when there's a sweetness and a relatability.\"",

The Straw at Miracle Mile Deli When it comes to New York-style deli fare in the middle of the dessert, Miracle Mile Deli is about as good as you can do. For generations, this has been a family-run operation serving brisket of beef, corned beef, and matzoh ball soup. This year, the restaurant moved to a new freestanding location on 16th Street — and it serves beer and wine. It's truly a new age for this Valley landmark restaurant. You will experience a food coma if you eat this sandwich, so consider yourself warned. Which isn't to say you should let the prospect of sleeping away the afternoon deter you from ordering the Straw. This sandwich is piled high with pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut, not a particularly original combination, but satisfying nonetheless. You'll get your choice of breads, and the best option is to get your sandwich served on a hearty onion roll that will actually soak up all the juices from the meat and kraut. For a side, you'll get a kosher dill pickle, of course, and you'll have a choice to stick with the customary offering (French fries) or upgrade to something else.

    "LabBody": "When the Tragically Hip recorded their landmark 1992 album, Fully Completely, the music industry was a different world. Back in the glory days of CD sales, recording budgets allowed worthy bands to fly to internationally renowned hotspots, stay for weeks at a time and work with a world-class producer. For the Hip, after making albums in Memphis and New Orleans, recording their third full-length in London with Chris Tsangarides had the makings of a “grand experience,” recalled Hip guitarist Rob Baker. Off to England went Baker and his bandmates: singer Gord Downie, guitarist Paul Langlois, bassist Gord Sinclair and drummer Johnny Fay. It turned out to be a “pretty horrible place,” Baker added with a chuckle. “There were some definite good things about it, but it was cold and rainy and we were in the studio twelve hours a day. We’d get out of the studio but there isn’t a lot to do late at night unless you really know where to go and have transport. So we’d go back to our little flat that we were all sharing and we’d play Scrabble and drink port and watch Olympic highlights.” Fortunately, they made a terrific album, at a time when the industry could support the extravagance of an out-of-country recording experience. That doesn’t happen much anymore. “The industry has changed so much that a band that gets lucky might get $30,000 to make their record, and for that, they give up publishing, some live income, revenue from merchandise. They give up a lot,” said Baker. “That was our art budget for Fully Completely. We spent $30,000 doing the cover.” In those days, he explained, major-label bands like the Hip would get a budget of about $150,000 to make a record. If it broke even, the budget went up a bit for the next one. By Fully Completely, Baker estimates the budget would have been more than $185,000. The numbers would grow for another decade. “Our album budgets were rising into the $300,000 level at the same time the bottom started to drop out of album sales,” Baker said, pinpointing the 2002 album In Violet Light as the moment the balance tipped. “You know, I’d like to think it had something to do with the business imploding rather than us getting really s***ty but it’s probably a combination.” Fans can debate that one, but everyone agrees they were the hottest band in the country in the early 1990s. When the five Kingston lads flew to London, they were road warriors, logging up to 200 shows per year. Tsangarides buffed their raw energy with a studio polish that sent the album to the top of the Canadian charts. There were no fewer than six singles: Locked in the Trunk of a Car, Fifty Mission Cap, Courage (For Hugh MacLennan), At the Hundredth Meridian, Looking for a Place to Happen and the title track. The band celebrated the release of Fully Completely with a deluxe edition of the album, and have spent most of 2015 revisiting the music on tour. It’s made for a surprisingly intense show, reports Baker.",

    "DiffbotBody": "We'd love to have a weekly date night, but who in the world is going to watch the kids? Yes, there will come a time when you will need a babysitter. It may seem hard to fathom (why would you ever leave your little angels?), but it's true. Perhaps it's a necessity like a doctor's appointment or the 2 p.m. matinee, but the fact remains — you need a babysitter. Read: How to spot a great babysitter Take a deep breath, and don't be terrified; there are ways to find your own personal Mary Poppins. Asking the right questions is key (as is knowing what some babysitters do when you're gone). Having this crucial intel can help you find someone who doesn't take advantage of the situation. In general, err on the side of caution; have a short phone interview or in-person conversation (with the kids there) to see how everyone gets along. It may seem old fashioned, but ask for references. Several online babysitting agencies make their applicants go through a background check; you could hire through one of these to know what your sitter's history is. Hiring someone who is CPR certified may also come in handy. Be sure to know if your sitter has a medical condition (like frequent seizures) that could possibly put your child in danger. It seems like a lot, but these are your kids we are talking about! If you are trusting someone with your children, you should know as much as you can about them in order to find a good fit for your family. Here are six things to keep an eye out for, but more importantly, how to find someone you'll feel completely comfortable leaving your kids with. 1. #Pooltime Social media can be a great asset for a babysitter (hello Pinterest), but it can also pull their attention away from watching your kids. How is your caretaker supposed to be taking care of your child if Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are more of a priority? Be candid about how your sitter uses social media. Ask to keep cell phones and other gadgets out of site while the kids are awake, and to not post photos of your children online without your permission. 2. Party at your place It can be unnerving enough having someone in your house to watch your kids, let alone their boyfriend, friends and siblings too. There's no way that your child will be first priority when your babysitter is focused on having a night in with friends. Don't be afraid to come off as controlling when you ask that no one is to come over while you are away. Your sitter may be wonderful, but there's no way of knowing that their friends are. Maybe asking a neighbor to keep an eye out for a potential party is a good option if you are feeling wary. 3. Extra toppings — on the house! Just because you've left some \"just in case\" cash on the counter doesn't give permission for a babysitting free for all; and having the parents gone doesn't mean rules go out the window. It's not unreasonable to ask a babysitter to put kids down at a regular bedtime, keep a schedule and have something other than ice cream and cake for dinner. Knowing exactly what amount of cash you've left behind and asking for receipts for purchased items can help avoid some financial mishaps. To make sure their night in goes as planned, leave a list out or a schedule to keep everyone on the same page. 4. \"But my dad says ... \" When parents are home, the little rug-rats know that they aren't the boss … but when a babysitter is over? Kids may think that things have changed. Even if your child knows that they aren't allowed to eat on the couch, does your sitter? It seems exhaustive, but making a list of house rules can help avoid some unnecessary drama when you come home. If your sitter knows what's to be expected, she can firmly answer \"No\" if kids try to bend the rules. 5. Tonight's season finale Yes, the kids may be sleeping, but it's still not a great time to catch the season finale of a not-so-PG TV show. It's hard to know who is watching from the top of the stairs, or learning a new \"vocabulary\" word or two while the season finale is streaming. As a parent, don't just toss out \"Use the TV and computer if you'd like\" offer, unless you mean it. Suggest that your sitter brings a book to read until you get home if you're not so sure what sort of thing your kids might be exposed to. 6. Negligence This can be kind of major (like forgetting to pick someone up from soccer practice) or a minor mishap (skipping important things like naps and snacks). Of course, negligence can be even more serious; signs of child abuse should be handled immediately … but hopefully these questions and getting a background check can prevent that from happening. Of course, you and your sitter should trust each other, but there may be times where your child can tell you more than your babysitter does. If your child seems to be excessively tired, hungry or generally unkempt when you return home, it's time to find a new sitter. If you do your research, you can avoid the worry that comes with having a babysitter over. Try having a little \"test run\" period, where you are only gone for 30 minutes or so, and then spend the rest of the afternoon talking with your sitter and playing with the kids. And don't forget to follow your gut; if you don't feel good about something, your motherly instinct is kicking in. But doing your research can help you find someone truly supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

    "DiffbotBody": "Who is the best player in the ? Not based on the last 10 years or one game, but over the last year: Who was the best? Good luck answering that one without starting a fight, right? Well, that's what the NFL 1000 aims to do by scouting, grading and then ranking the best players at each position before putting them in order and breaking ties to come up with the top 1,000 players. No narratives, no fantasy football points, no quarterback rating: This is cold, hard scouting. You can find rankings for all other positions on our B/R NFL 1000 main page. The B/R 1000 metric is based heavily on scouting each player and grading the key criteria for each position. The criteria are weighed according to importance for a possible best score of 100. Potential is not taken into consideration, nor are career accomplishments. Cornerbacks have many responsibilities—and those vary depending on the individual scheme. With that in mind, we graded them on run defense (10 points), coverage (75) and tackling (10), plus five points for their value as a starter or backup. In that category, we're looking at whether the player is a consistent starter, a spot starter, a top-level backup or simply a backup-only player. In the case of ties, our team asked, \"Which player would I rather have on my team?\" and set the rankings accordingly. Subjective? Yes. But ties are no fun. Each player was scouted by me and a team of experienced evaluators (Dan Bazal, Cian Fahey, Dan Hope, Marshal Miller, Justis Mosqueda) with these key criteria in mind. The following scouting reports and grades are the work of months of film study from our team. Players' heights, weights, seasons played and coverage stats from NFL.com unless otherwise noted. All other statistics from Pro Football Focus. Begin Slideshow » Coverage: 51/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 5/5 Greg Toler (6'0\", 190 lbs, 5 seasons) has big potential and has flashed top-tier talent at times, but he was far too inconsistent in 2014 as both a cover man and a tackler. On the ground, he saw 14 of his tackle attempts go for naught—a number that puts a huge damper on his run and tackle scores. In coverage, Toler played largely in man schemes while allowing nine touchdowns and letting 56 percent of attempts thrown his way go for a completion. Coverage: 53/75; Run Defense: 5/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 4/5 Coming off the best season of his career in 2013, Will Blackmon (6’0”, 204 lbs, 8 seasons) crashed back down to earth with a rough 2014 campaign. Working as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ slot cornerback for their first eight games, Blackmon was picked on in coverage and did not record a single pass deflection. After missing the second half of the season with a broken finger, Blackmon was released by the Jaguars this offseason. He was picked up by the Seattle Seahawks, where he is competing to be their slot cornerback, but the injury-prone 30-year-old is truly best suited for playing on special teams. Coverage: 56/75; Run Defense: 2/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 Melvin White (6’1”, 215 lbs, 2 seasons) began the 2014 season as a starter for the Carolina Panthers but lost playing time over the course of the year due to poor performance. A big but slow cornerback, White makes some plays on the ball with his length but does not play with enough physicality or fluidity to make up for his athletic shortcomings. He is inconsistent both in coverage and as a tackler and does not make the impact a cornerback of his size should in run defense. Coverage: 52/75; Run Defense: 6/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 At one point, Robert McClain (5’9”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) looked set to be one of the better slot cornerbacks in the NFL. However, his performances since that point have dropped off significantly. McClain struggles with his footwork, something that is a major issue for cornerbacks who play inside, and he can’t make up for that with length or ball skills. While he is a good run defender in terms of reacting to plays and aggressively forcing his way to ball-carriers, he must become a better tackler to truly show value there. Coverage: 55/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 5/10; Starter: 3/5 Chris Owens (5’9”, 180 lbs, 6 seasons) is one of many players across the NFL who is immediately thought of as a good slot cornerback simply because of his size. It’s true that Owens had proved to be adequate in the past, but his skill set doesn’t allow him to handle the two-way game that comes with playing inside. Owens doesn’t have the foot speed or balance to consistently contain the faster inside receivers in the NFL, which showed during the 2014 season. Coverage: 57/75; Run Defense: 4/10; Tackling: 2/10; Starter: 3/5 While Cassius Vaughn (5’11”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) has good long speed, he is slow coming out of his stance and flipping his hips, which enables receivers to beat him off the line frequently. He does not play physically and is a poor tackler. After one unimpressive season with the Detroit Lions, Vaughn signed this offseason with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he will have to fight just to make the 53-man roster.",

Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years' data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K. Revenues. Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spinoff is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks and savings institutions are interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. Profits. Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2013 profits to 2014 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting. Balance Sheet. Assets are the company’s year-end total. Total stockholders’ equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company’s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company’s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity. Employees. The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee. Earnings Per Share. The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company’s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded. Total Return to Investors. Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company’s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2014 of stock owned at the end of 2004, 2009, and 2013. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spinoffs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded. Medians. No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2013 to 2014 do not include companies that lost money in 2013 or lost money in both 2013 and 2014, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases. Credits. This Fortune 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Richard K. Tucksmith and Rhona Altschuler. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, she used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S\u0026P Capital IQ to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support. Edith Fried reviewed and edited nonstatistical information. Researchers Viki Goldman and Kathleen Lyons assisted with the data gathering and verification. The data verification process was aided substantially by information provided by S\u0026P Capital IQ. Other sources used were: FactSet Research Systems, Hoover’s and Morningstar Document Research.",

What’s Happening: The Error on Dylann Roof's Background Check The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans. When the cyberbreach was first reported in June, only 4 million Americans, mostly government workers and contractors, were thought to be affected. The Confederate flag comes down in Columbia: One day after South Carolina lawmakers voted to remove the divisive symbol from state grounds, an honor guard removed it in a ceremony on Friday. A crowd cheered and chanted “U.S.A.” and “take it down” as the flag was lowered. The NCAA announced that the state is now eligible to host future tournaments.

We bore and burn out easily—particularly, it seems, when it comes to fitness.” Christopher Orr: “There’s plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted, and the minions themselves are consistently amusing...

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTARY | ALEJANDRO ARREDONDO For the past few years, American citizens have lived under the shadow of an imminent financial collapse: the looming “debt ceiling,” as well as Chinese economic dominance. Currently, our national debt exceeds $18 trillion. To relieve the national debt, Congress has repeatedly issued proposals containing complex solutions that focus on either rampantly raising taxes, siphoning funds from major government programs, raising the age requirement to collect Social Security, or creating a larger “debt ceiling.” A key fact that many choose to ignore or simply forget, however, is that nearly 34 percent of U.S. debt belongs to foreign nations. China, as the largest foreign holder of American debt, owns approximately $1.26 trillion of debt in the form of bonds, notes and other financial instruments, according to the Treasury. The second largest holder of American debt is Japan, possessing a sum of debt in excess of $1.2 trillion as well. Our U.S. government, however, has yet to collect on the Chinese debt that we hold in our vaults, in our bank accounts, and in our homes. American companies, banks and over 20,000 private investors and U.S. citizens own almost $1 trillion worth of debt in historic bonds and notes. There is a simple solution that would help Americans redeem their bonds, but one that seems to elude Congress: By performing a stateto state debt swap, we would drastically reduce our debt and prevent the interest rates attached to the debt from further consuming our budget. The swap entails China redeeming the bonds that are owned by the U.S. government and by private American investors at market value, and then the U.S. government swap the bonds in the Treasury for a reduction in the total debt that China holds. The swap would even out the debt between the two nations and should leave American investors satisfied. To have some context, these historical bonds were a byproduct of the various wars waged by China in the early 20th century. In 1911, the Chinese people overthrew the Qing dynasty leading to the eventual founding of the Guomindang, the Chinese nationalist party. The resultant power vacuum led to the turbulent Warlord Period as well as the Northern expedition under Chiang Kai-Shek. Victorious and increasingly popular, the GMD established itself as the reigning political leader of China. But when communism began to gain influence in the Eastern hemisphere, various revolutionaries established the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. The ideological conflicts between these two major political parties propelled China into first and second Chinese Civil War. And to fund the multiple wars and conflicts, the Nanjing government issued a plethora of different bonds, such as the Liberty bonds and the Super Petchillis, to foreign nations. In essence, the purchasing of these bonds by the United States symbolized good will and represented a step toward successful and prosperous Sino-American relations, but apparently, the expulsion of the GMD to Taiwan and the CCP’s rise to power is reason enough to forget its debts to foreign countries. It is not only unfair that the United States pays its debts in a timely fashion, and China refuses to pay theirs. It is a violation of both international laws set by the World Trade Organization, of which China is a member, as they have yet to fulfill their financial responsibilities. In fact, China paid Britain for their bonds in the 1987 China-Brit Treaty, but purposely excluded American bondholders from the negotiations. Furthermore, the Chinese government, PRC, can object and attempt to make the feeble argument that debt is the responsibility of the former government, GMD; however, they are violating the “Successor Government Doctrine,” which clearly states that, if a government succeeds another, then it assumes its assets as well as its liabilities, according to Resolution 160 of the 110th Congress. It is a dangerous game to allow foreign nations to hold a substantial claim to America’s debt. And it is more dangerous to permit another nation to absolve itself from debt because it displays utter weakness, a trait that is unrepresentative of the United States. The American people must realize that the government has a stake in Chinese debt. If this continues, will this kind of foreign policy establish a precedent for other countries to ignore their debts to the United States? This current scenario is troubling, and citizens must compel their representatives to diminish the United States’ debt and reverse the current trend of inaction. Alejandro Arredondo recently graduated from the International Baccalaureate at Lamar Academy in McAllen and plans to attend St. Edwards University in Austin in the fall, where he will study finance and political science.",

In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

    "DiffbotBody": "The rumored “Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo” smartphone is back in the news after a small hiatus. According to reports, a brand-new device was spotted in the Wi-Fi interoperability certification site, and it's believed to be the S5 Neo. The smartphone entry tied to model number SM-G903F has apparently received Wi-Fi certification. When a device gets a Wi-Fi certification, the site gives away key specifications and features. Sam Mobile says the model number matches the device the site discovered earlier, so Samsung could finally be launching the Galaxy S5 Neo. As far as the key Galaxy S5 Neo specifications go, the handset will reportedly be identical to the 2014 flagship Galaxy S5 in many ways. The device will come with a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, aided by a full HD screen resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Under the hood, the Galaxy S5 Neo will reportedly be powered by a 64-bit octa-core (Samsung Exynos 7580) processor, running at 1.6 GHz. In comparison, the flagship Galaxy S5 comes powered by a Snapdragon 801 processor. Plus, the Neo will be backed by a modest 2 GB of RAM unit and the graphics side will be taken care by a Mali-T720 GPU, notes GSM Arena. On the software front, as expected, the handset will run on Android 5.1 Lollipop OS, straight out of the box. And the device will come equipped with 16 GB of in-built storage capacity. The Neo will reportedly sport a 16 MP rear-facing camera unit. In addition, it will flaunt a generous 5 MP front-facing snapper unit for selfies and video chats. Furthermore, the entire configurations will be held together and powered by a good 2,800 mAh battery unit. In addition to the standard connectivity options, the Galaxy S5 Neo will support LTE Advanced or LTE-A. Notably, the Galaxy S5 comes with only the standard LTE support. To top it all off, this Neo device will be released in single-SIM and dual-SIM models. In the meantime, an earlier rumor out of the Czech Republic stated the price of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo will be $490 equivalent. Even though this device cannot be compared to the South Korean tech giant’s Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, for a mid- to high-end handset, the specifications sounds like a good deal. Samsung has not confirmed the Galaxy S5 Neo specifications or price thus far.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project.

    "DiffbotBody": "A different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. How exactly does one follow up , the surprise-hit, male-stripper melodrama that catered to a heated audience (mainly female, slightly male) but served them a cinematic buffet concocted by skilled storyteller Steven Soderbergh? Easy. You take the show on the road. To that extent, Magic Mike XXL is the most accurate depiction of male entertainers road-tripping from Tampa to Myrtle Beach for an annual convention that Hollywood has ever produced. If you only see one movie this summer about male strippers bonding over unfulfilled dreams while they titillate female clientele, make sure it’s this one. Why? Because it’s great. Magic Mike XXL often operates as the movie Entourage desperately wanted to be – or worse, actually thinks that it is. It’s 100% bro-powered, telling the low-stakes story of impossibly handsome dudes living their irregular lives, and inviting us along for the intimate ride. But the camaraderie and mutual respect – the Zen-like “chi” that’s preached and practiced by the men of Mike -- is as organic as unforced as Entourage was artificial. As a result, Magic Mike is believable, embraceable, and worthy of celebration. Where Richard Donner’s Superman once inspired us to believe that a man can fly, Magic Mike XXL convinces us beyond a shadow of a doubt that a dancer can leave the stage behind and open an ice cream truck that has a DJ booth attached -- entertaining the masses and satisfying their sweet tooth at the same time. Picking up shortly after Magic Mike concluded, the sequel finds Mike (Channing Tatum) struggling to get his carpentry business off the ground when a phone call summons him back to Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), the freewheeling choreographer and club owner, has jumped ship, leaving beautiful but dense dancers “Big Dick” Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan, (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tito (Adam Rodriguez) rudderless. Sensing that their stripper endeavors are drawing to a close, the guys agree to venture to South Carolina for one last blowout bash at an annual dancers’ convention. Along the way, Mike convinces them to ditch the routines that Dallas burned into their individual memories (“You are not a fireman, Richie”) and embrace new routines that come from the heart. And the crotch. But mainly from the heart. Magic Mike XXL pulls off a legitimate magic trick, recognizing the expectations of its suddenly sizable fanbase and somehow exceeding them. Magic Mike XXL isn’t surprising anyone this time out. The original film cost roughly $7 million, but went on to gross a massive $167 million, fuelled by female curiosity, the magnetism of Tatum (and his co-stars), and legitimately positive word of mouth that proclaimed Soderbergh crafted a moving soap-opera in a seedy, sweat-soaked Tampa strip club – the unlikeliest of cinematic communities. Audiences came to the theater with crumpled up singles, but left Magic Mike with soggy tissues, emotionally buying in to the ongoing struggles of these three-dimensional dancers. A sequel was inevitable, and with it comes change. Soderbergh opted to stay in his self-imposed “retirement,” handing the directing duties over to longtime collaborator Gregory Jacobs (though Soderbergh did contribute to XXL as a cinematographer and editor, explaining why this follow-up has the same sweaty, late-night shimmer of the first film). And now that he has an Oscar on his shelf, McConaughey chose to hang up Dallas’ leather chaps and opt out of the fun. No bother. His mystical aura is usurped by a larger-than-life Jada Pinkett Smith, who slinks across the screen and deliberately swipes every scene as Rome, an uber-confident and confidence-boosting Savannah strip club owner who welcomes Mike back into her world of empowerment. Like Dallas, Rome resembles a character we only think exists on screen in stories like Mike XXL, and I wondered numerous times during her unique scenes if this person, and her establishment, actually exist. Moving forward, however, I don’t need more Rome. Quite the contrary. I’d be thrilled if each Magic Mike sequel found a new character actor willing to fill the “role” of outsized Mike mentor, the way McConaughey and Pinkett Smith already have. Wait, subsequent Magic Mike movies? You better believe it. Magic Mike XXL is a different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining… by design. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and surprisingly unpredictable. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. XXL sheds the heaviest baggage of Soderbergh’s initial foray, keeping just enough drama to ensure tension, then filling in the gaps with unfiltered bro-heavy chemistry. It’s a winning formula, and one that proves that Mike’s world is one worth revisiting, just to spend time with these friends. We spend a lot of time talking about developing Cinematic Universes for characters who don tights and capes. What about the guys who slip out of their super suits to entertain? Don’t they deserve their own multi-film series? If and when Magic Mike XXL matches the box-office bar set by the original, it’s time we start having that conversation.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Lisa Kohl, a 27-year-old corporate executive in Munich, has watched the ceaseless debate over the latest bailout package for Greece with concern. The COO of a German market research company, Kohl said she already pays high taxes as a single person with no children, and many Germans worry that further economic unraveling in Greece could cost Germany more money. “If we continue paying, what are we paying for?” said Kohl, echoing what she described as the sentiment of many in Germany. Kohl is one of many young Germans closely watching the debate over a solution for Greece. German millennials are part of the first generation to grow up in the single currency eurozone, and they have seen their country serve as a European Union leader for years. As unmarried young people without children, they often pay high taxes, and see themselves as bankrolling a large chunk of Greece's debt. Many are deeply invested in the situation in Greece, but are divided over whether the German government should express solidarity with their fellow Europeans in Athens or continue to take a firm stance on Greece repaying its debt. In January, 61 percent of Germans were in favor of Greece leaving the Eurozone, according to poll data. The same poll reported that 68 percent were against debt forgiveness and that 4 out of 5 people polled favored strict austerity measures. By late Thursday, the Greek government had bent considerably toward the German position, proposing a fresh bailout in exchange for accepting a broad package of spending cuts. Yet if a deal fails to materialize or if it comes without forgiveness for the enormous debts the Greek government now shoulders, many young Germans fear that they will ultimately be the ones paying the bills. Some of the fear concerning higher taxes may be unfounded, since the German government owns only a portion of Greece’s debt -- the rest of it being held by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and other governments and private banks throughout Europe. But private entities now only own 17 percent of Greece’s debt and European governments hold the lion's share: almost 62 percent of 322 billion euros. The German government has the highest stake of those Euro-area governments, making German taxpayers responsible for 65 billion euros, according to Bloomberg. “Greece Is Mocking The Rest Of Europe” Discussions surrounding debt forgiveness and the possibility of additional loans to Greece have long raged in Germany, given their large stake in Greek debt. These debates were stoked by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ visit to Strasbourg on Wednesday, where he discussed an additional 3-year loan proposal with European creditors. The new deal that Tsipras has put on the table involves a 53.5 billion euro bailout in exchange for budget and spending cuts. Young Germans have been less affected by the recession that has walloped Europe in recent years. Germany has the lowest youth unemployment rate in the European Union, while Greece’s number of unemployed young people is the second highest in the region, trailing only Spain. Still, many young Germans who are pro-austerity said they were worried Greece’s financial troubles could hurt their futures. Many talked about the need for safe spending when it comes to Greece. \"Younger people are not necessarily angry, but they feel that everything that has been done in the past two, three and four years has been for nothing -- that all the money has been wasted that could’ve been put into much better use,” said Ferdinand Vogel, 23, a student and German National Guard trainee officer who writes the current events blog “Young German.” Vogel, who lives in Berlin, said Greece needed to take more responsibility for its actions before debt forgiveness could even be put on the table. “If Greece wants to stay in the EU, it should abide by the standards of the EU,\" he said. Torsten Heinrich, 32, a writer and former youth organizer for the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, said he was fed up with the empty promises made by Tsipiras’ Syriza-led government. “Greece is mocking the rest of Europe,” said Heinrich, of Wurzburg in southern Germany. “They have promised reforms; they haven’t done anything. Instead they are asking for more money and more money ... Patience is running out.” Heinrich said he supported debt forgiveness, but only because he thought it was inevitable. “The Greeks will never be able to pay [their loans] back,” he said. Continuing Faith In The European Project Critics of Germany’s hard stance on Greece’s debt crisis, however, point to Germany’s experiences with debt forgiveness after World War II as an example of how the German government has acted hypocritically toward Greece in the past five years. In 1953, with the London Debt Agreement, Germany was forgiven around 50 percent of the debts it had incurred during reconstruction following the war. One of the major signatories of this European agreement was Greece. The agreement, in conjunction with the Marshall Plan, which provided multiple billions of dollars to post-war Germany, kept the German economy from being strangled by debt and allowed it to become the strongest economy in Europe today. People line up to buy rare goods on Berlin's market, during the Berlin occidental zone blockade by Russia, in June 1948. JEAN MANZON/AFP/Getty Images In fact, one of Tsipiras' first official acts as prime minister was to suggest that Germany pay reparations to Greece for the destruction caused when the country was occupied during the Second World War -- a move that outraged Merkel. Germany’s unforgiving tone toward Greece these days is ironic, said Timothy Guinnane, a professor of historical economics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who has written about the London Debt Agreement of 1953. “In 1953, the poor Greeks were helping the rich Germans,” he said in a phone interview. Many young Germans understand the crisis through this kind of solidarity. Julian Greth, 24, an engineering student from Munich, described the Greek population as the “victims” of the crisis -- not the Germans. He also said that everything in Europe was connected and that the EU could not simply kick Greece out without any broader repercussions. His stake in Greece is more than one of a future taxpayer. Greth is somewhat of a Grecophile and has traveled to Greece four times on vacation. “As a country, it’s still the same -- friendly, helpful,” he said of his recent experience in Greece. Matthias Adler, a 34 year-old freelance writer from Berlin, argued that Greeks deserve Germany’s financial and emotional support. Adler was born and raised in Berlin by left-wing parents and said that a good deal of his politics and those of his friends who share his views stem from their geographic location and their upbringing. The politics of south Germany, he said, tended to be more conservative and pro-austerity by comparison. From Adler’s perspective, Greece leaving the EU is unimaginable. He said he couldn't understand the fierce anger many Germans felt toward Greeks and that he would continue to stand in solidarity with them. “In my opinion, it’s not a Greek problem, it’s a European problem,” he said. “We Germans are the ones who have profited the most from this whole European Union, and I hope we don’t forget that.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "If you are at Chicago's Midway Airport or on board a Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) flight in the days ahead, don't be surprised if you see a lot of smiling Southwest flight attendants in your midst. Midway is Southwest's largest hub, and home base for many of the carrier's flight attendants. Late last week, the executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, who represent more than 13,500 Southwest flight attendants altogether, voted to approve a tentative new contract, which over the next several weeks will be presented to the full membership to ratify. A spokesman for Local 556 today said the vote on the new contract should be completed by the end of July. If, as expected, the contract is approved by the full union membership, Southwest flight attendants would, according to Local 556 President and lead negotiator Audrey Stone, \"continue to be the highest paid in the (airline) industry through 2019.\" The new contract also would be retroactive to 2013 when negotiations began. A spokesman for Local 556 said the contract does include pay raises for flight attendants, who in turn would agree to work rule revisions in exchange for the higher pay. Full details of the tentative new collective bargaining agreement will be released soon, the Local said. Southwest's tentative new contract with its flight attendants, however, still leaves the low-fare behemoth without new contracts with three major units in its workforce — pilots, mechanics and ramp agents who handle baggage and other crucial plane servicing functions at the gate. Southwest flight attendants were in negotiations for two years on their new contract. But ramp agents, who are growing increasingly restless, have been without a new contract for some four years. A large group of ramp agents recently picketed Southwest's annual meeting, and ramp agents who were unhappy about the excruciatingly slow progress of contract talks are believed to have been a key factor in the historic Southwest Airlines meltdown at Midway Airport in early 2014 that left 16 Southwest planes filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. The recent picketing and other rumblings about labor unrest at Southwest may have prompted Southwest CEO Gary Kelly to speed up efforts to get new contracts with all of the various unions who comprise his airline's workforce. Any major concerns about possible employee strikes could cause Southwest customers to consider booking flights with competitors instead.",

(MICHAEL PATRICK/NEWS SENTINEL) Maryville lawyer Kevin Shepherd said that by filing a class-action lawsuit Friday, his clients hope to advocate for the 5,000 residents evacuated from their homes during the July 2 CSX train derailment in Blount County. Shepherd’s office filed the lawsuit at 3:10 p.m. Friday in the circuit court for Blount County, with married couple Kelli and Aaron Johnson listed as plaintiffs. Shepherd said the Johnsons, whom he knew personally before acting as their lawyer, have two children younger than 2 and live within the 2-mile radius evacuated during the derailment, though not in the area immediately affected by the spill of the chemical acrylonitrile the derailed tanker was carrying. Shepherd said the Johnsons, who were not available for comment Friday, had no personal medical injuries that they were aware of. He expects individual suits to be filed by people who were hospitalized, he said, and hopes for “long-range medical monitoring” of potential health effects from the chemical. He also noted CSX is compensating residents for business loss and expenses associated with evacuation. Continue reading at the Knoxville News Sentinel. comments powered by Disqus",

    "DiffbotBody": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's new book, A Time For Truth, outsold nearly all of the 20 books on The New York Times' weekly bestseller list. The Texas senator's book ranks fourth on The Wall Street Journal hardcover list and fourth on the Publisher's Weekly hardcover list, Politico points out. And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",

The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

While there are certainly pros to a job that immerses you in the lives of the rich and powerful, it can also reveal the ugly side of humanity. Assistants see everything — from their employer’s daily schedule to their most intimate moments. It can feel like a roller coaster, with a boss acting like a demon from hell one minute and gifting their assistant an expensive bag the next. Bosses everywhere have their quirks, but a town like Los Angeles — with its abundance of celebrities and moguls — can breed a particularly terrifying species. Being an assistant might as well earn you a degree in the psychology of human behavior. And while some former assistants would prefer to leave their traumatizing employment experience in the past, there are the ones who have felt scorned enough to write a juicy memoir. Read on for seven scary stories from former assistants with bosses from hell, from a germaphobe actress to a Miranda Priestly wannabe.

With your back turned away from the supporting structure, grab each handle and take a large step forward. The beauty of the band is that you can adjust its resistance simply by removing slack from the tube. The further you step away from the column, the harder the exercise becomes. With palms at shoulder height, push through your chest until your arms are completely extended. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions. Reverse Gears. The next exercise requires a similar setup, however you will be facing your support column rather than having your back to it. With a handle in each hand, take a big step backwards while pulling your hands in towards either side of your ribcage. Bring your feet back to center, and perform the same exercise with the opposite foot. The reverse lunge row is a powerful movement in that it targets major muscle groups and aids in bettering your balance. Balancing exercises should be incorporated into every workout routine, as they are crucial in strengthening your core, improving the integrity of your spine and preventing injuries from falls. Complete 15 repetitions per side. Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head. Crank out 12-15 repetitions. Repeat each exercise 3-5 times to guarantee a good burn, baby burn. Sometimes the best cure in the fight against fat is to apply a little resistance band-aid. Earn it.

    "DiffbotBody": "Southwest Airlines' controversial CEO Gary Kelly appears to have opened a huge hornets' nest in the wake of news about a tentative agreement on a new contract with more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants who work at the low-fare behemoth. With Southwest's largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, Chicago also is the domicile for the largest number of Southwest flight attendants, more than 1,800 altogether, according to a spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents Southwest flight attendants. Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Another flight attendant with more than a decade of work at Southwest offered a similar sentiment in an email: \"The (Local 556) union does appear to be too cozy with management.\" Though so-called \"educators\" have been used by Local 556 in the past to help members sort through and understand details of proposed contracts, some flight attendants questioned that procedure this time around, suggesting it could be another means of influencing— or pressuring — union members to vote in favor of a new contract. Noted one Southwest flight attendant: \"Our union handpicked 100 people to fly into Dallas for 'tentative agreement' training with our union dollars for two days so they could 'educate' the rest of us on the tentative agreement.\" Some flight attendants also wondered why Southwest management was suddenly able to come to tentative terms with flight attendants, while other major unions, including those representing pilots, ramp agents and mechanics, have been unable to get even a tentative deal. Ramp agents, in particular, have been in talks for some four years. Flight attendant contract negotiations had been ongoing for two years. The rank and file members of Local 556 will be able to get their first look at the full contract starting tomorrow. Then they will have 16 days to obtain the proposed contract, read it, digest it and then vote — a shorter time frame than the 30-day window for previous contracts, according to some flight attendants who wonder why this is all suddenly so rushed. A Local 556 spokesman said the contract would be ratified if a majority of those who actually vote cast a vote in favor of ratification. As for the vocal backlash among some rank and file union members to news of the tentative contract, a Local 556 spokesman noted: \"We are a large group and not everyone is going to see things the same way.\" By the end of July, however, it should be clear whether enough flight attendants see the proposed contract the same way Southwest Airlines management and Local 556's executive board apparently do.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Today, it starts to get really real for the more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants that work for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV). Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue. In years 2016 and 2018, flight attendants would instead get a 3 percent annual bonus, that would subsequently be taxed at 40 percent. And some flight attendants are upset about the new way vacation benefits will be calculated under terms of the proposed contract — a complicated system that will create a more defined two-tier culture of full-time and part-time employees at the airline. The new contract also calls for longer duty day hours for flight attendants in some instances, rising from 10.5 hours to 12 hours — which was not what many flight attendants were hoping to see in a new contract. But even much smaller things in the proposed contract are being viewed as losses by some flight attendants. They include a new provision that requires flight attendants to report for duty 45 minutes before the schedule departure of flights on Southwest's new — and much larger — Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that seats approximately 30 more passengers than the Boeing 737-700 series model. Previously, flight attendants were required to be at the plane 30 minutes before departure. Southwest Airlines is expected to add many more 737-800 aircraft to its fleet starting next year. One truly veteran Southwest Airlines flight attendant who has clocked well over 30 years with the carrier had this to say today after reading through the new proposed contract: \"I have seen enough and compared to our previous contract language to know for certain this is a concessionary contract. Also, even though there is no defined contract language for retroactive pay, it has always been negotiated for our flight attendants going back to the date the contract expired (in 2013 in this instance). There is no retro pay, just a signing bonus (in the proposed contract). The bonus is taxed at 40 percent.\" Other flight attendants I heard from today point the finger directly at Southwest management, including CEO Gary Kelly, for all the angst the new proposed contract is generating among flight attendants as they prepare to vote on it. Noted one flight attendant: \"The negative publicity Gary Kelly is getting in the media is exactly what he wants to sweep under the rug. He thrives on feeling everyone is behind him 100 percent. I really think he has lost contact with the real world.\" A spokesman for Local 556 did not return a call seeking comment today or provide a copy of the tentative contract agreed to by Local 556's executive board and Southwest Airlines management.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Why is it that some people achieve so much more than others? Are they blessed with \"golden child\" genes or is it something more common than that? Everyone wants to know the secret to success. Hundreds of authors have written books on their idea of what the secret is, and millions have purchased those books looking for the answer. However, many people look at the big successes of people but don't really delve into the little successes and actions that got them there. Benjamin Franklin wrote out and planned every hour of his day from waking up and bathing to \"putting things in order.\" It is the daily actions of successful people, the little things that most people overlook, that get them to the top. The good news is that these habits can be encouraged at an early age. Many successful people are creatures of habit when it comes to how they plan their day, and the choices they make with their time makes all the difference in the level of success they achieve. If you aspire for a more productive day and desire a higher level of opportunties for your children in their lives, here are five habits many successful people do on a daily basis. 1. Have a morning routine This seems like a tedious and minuscule aspect of someone's day, but the truth is, a morning routine has a positive effect on your day. That feeling encourages you to cross something off your list and leaves you feeling accomplished. The purpose of your routine should be to prepare for the day as well as to get started on accomplishing tasks. Not everything you do will be something you enjoy, but you can mix it up with things that get the dopamine flowing, like having your favorite muffin for breakfast. By adapting a morning routine for your children, they have an opportunity to mentally prepare for the demands of the day. An organized morning eliminates misplaced homework, wasted time chasing down a lost shoe, and allows your child time to concentrate on the demands of the day. 2. Have a to-do list Many people overlook the value of having a to-do list. Yet, it provides a localized place where everything you need to do is written down. One of the simple pleasures of the day is being able to cross off a task when completed. By keeping up with your list, you tend to automatically fall into a mode of productivity, which keeps running throughout the day. Put the things you absolutely need to accomplish at the top, followed by the things you need to complete soon, ending with the things that do not have a close deadline. But start the list with something easy to complete, giving yourself a little dose of accomplishment that gets you a head start on your list. Many schools now encourage the use of a daily planner for their students to keep track of upcoming assignments and test schedules. By utilizing a to-do list, and reviewing it regularly, your child won't be caught unprepared for an upcoming midterm or research paper. 3. Do the things you hate first \"Do your chores, then you can play with your friends.\" This childhood motto still holds true for adults. Try getting the tedious and most disliked tasks out of the way. You'll feel the weight come off your shoulders, and you will be able to enjoy the tasks you like even more when you know you don't have the unpleasant ones hanging over your head. On top of that, the day will seem to go by much faster after you've eliminated the not-so-fun tasks. 4. Focus on the positives So often in life we are prepared to perform our best, yet things don't go our way. Despite our efforts, we still took second in debate, we didn't make the basketball team, we didn't get accepted to the school of our choice. Life is filled with disappointments and setbacks. If you focus on the things you are good at and the positive aspects of the day it will alter your mood to reflect your positive thinking, and things will begin to change. An important lesson for your children is to realize that life will require a need to adapt. Yet, you can continue forward by focusing on the successes you have had. Don't let negativity consume your thinking. Remember, a ship (you) can be sunk by a single puncture if it continues to let in more water (negativity). 5. Visualize Jack Nicklaus is often referred to as the greatest golfer of all time. Throughout a 25-year professional career that included winning 18 major golf championships, Nicklaus practiced visualization with every shot. He mentally played the hole before he ever picked up his club to swing. \"Sometimes the biggest problem is in your head. You've got to believe you can play a shot instead of wondering where your next bad shot is coming from,\" he said. Envisioning your success is vital. It enables you to focus on your goals and get your mind thinking positively. \"The man who thinks he can, and the man who thinks he can't, are both usually right.\" Athletes in all sports are instructed to visualize their next at-bat or their next goal because it truly does have a significant effect on the outcome. For many of us, the pathway to success may seem out of reach or reserved for those of extraordinary talent. But history is filled with extraordinary leaders whose beginnings were less than ideal. By incorporating a morning routine, organizing tasks, focusing on our abilities and keeping a clear vision in mind of what we hope to accomplish, we can enjoy a life filled with productivity, achievement and success.

With Regis and Kathie Lee” alongside Philbin from 1985 to 2000, will still be paired with Hoda Kotb during the famously boozy segment of the show. “Reg, what are you doing here?” Gifford exclaimed when Philbin tended bar during Thursday’s segment. “I’ve got a job here!” he replied. “We thought (he) would be the perfect person to join our motley crew: Regis Philbin is joining the fourth hour,” Kotb said. “I wish we could have him every day, but he’s very busy,” Gifford added. The 83-year-old got his start as an NBC page and went on to play Joey Bishop’s sidekick on “The Joey Bishop Show.” He departed “Live!” in 2011 after racking up 28 years on the various iterations of the show. Not quite retired, Philbin has returned to television frequently, hosting and contributing to a bevy of projects. He’s also a familiar face on “Today,” appearing on the program several times in recent months, notably taking on a starring role in “Today the Musical” in December. Philbin has 24 Daytime Emmy nominations, six wins and a lifetime achievement award. He has also broken the Guinness World Record for most hours on camera.
