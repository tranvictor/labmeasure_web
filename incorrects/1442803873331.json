    "DiffbotBody": "entertainment Earlier this week, we reported that conservative actor Tom Selleck was facing a lawsuit for allegedly stealing tankloads of water from a hydrant for his ranch during the California drought. The liberal media quickly jumped on the story, making it go viral in an attempt to slander the name of Selleck due to his conservative views. Unfortunately for these liberal haters, however, this story is about to come to an end. According to Daily Mail, Selleck has reached a tentative agreement with the Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County, located just north of Los Angeles. The agreement will now go to the agency’s board for approval, and they will be meeting to decide on that next Wednesday. “We’re happy about it,” commented Eric Bergh, the district’s resources manager. “It’s good news.” He added that details of the agreement are confidential. Selleck and his wife of nearly 30 years Jillie Mack were accused of dispatching a white truck to retrieve gallons of water from a valley close to their ranch on 12 occasions in 2013. The water district spent $22,000 on a private investigator to catch the Hollywood couple. This agreement, however, means that this story is now coming to a close, so it’s time for the liberal media to back off and leave the Sellecks alone!",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Tuesday, July 7, 2015, 9:00 p.m. I love grilling vegetables because doing so concentrates their natural sugars and amps up their flavor. During the summer, the usual suspects are zucchini, eggplant, onions, peppers and corn. They're all delicious this way and — Bonus! — they all become tender in an agreeably short amount of time. But it recently occurred to me that a number of the veggies I love roasting in the oven — broccoli, cauliflower and carrots — might also shine if cooked on the grill. Turns out, they do! The first problem was to figure out how to cut these vegetables so they wouldn't fall through the slats of the grill grates. The solution was to keep them in big pieces; I cut the carrots in half lengthwise, left the broccoli attached at the stalk, and sliced the cauliflower head straight down into half-inch cutlets (or “steaks”). These precautions kept the vegetables from falling into the flames, which allowed me to discover that it took forever for them to become tender. To speed up the process, I started by blanching them. After this quick bath in boiling water, I popped the vegetables in ice water to stop the cooking, then made sure they were dry before oiling, seasoning and grilling. Suddenly, these guys took no time at all to get tender. And they browned nicely along the way. Yay! Also, sure enough, their flavor became concentrated, just as it does when roasted. Indeed, it was assertive enough to pair up with a tahini sauce and spicy panko crumbs. When the vegetables are this robust, you may even decide you don't need the grilled steak. Chef Sara Moulton writes this column for the Associated Press. Grilled Vegetables With Tahini Sauce and Spicy Panko Start to finish: 1 hour 1⁄4 cup tahini, well stirred 2 1⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons water, plus more if needed for sauce 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt 1⁄2 cup panko bread crumbs 1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper Water for cooking and cooling vegetables Ice 1 head broccoli, quartered down the center 1 small head cauliflower, sliced into 1⁄2-inch-thick “steaks” 6 large carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise Vegetable or canola oil, for brushing the vegetables Freshly ground black pepper In a medium bowl, stir together the tahini, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the water, lemon juice, garlic and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt. Add additional water if necessary to achieve a pourable consistency. Set aside. In a large skillet over medium, heat the remaining 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the crushed red pepper and a hefty pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the bread crumbs turn golden, for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a grill to medium. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice and water and place it next to the pot. Add the broccoli and cook it for 2 minutes. Use tongs to remove the broccoli from the water and place it in the ice water. Cool it completely, then pat dry with paper towels. Repeat this process with the cauliflower and carrots, cooking the cauliflower for 2 minutes and the carrots for 3 minutes. Brush all of the vegetables well on both sides with vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper and, working in batches if necessary, grill them on direct medium heat, with the grill covered, until they have distinct grill marks on the bottom, for about 5 minutes. Turn them over and grill on the second side until they have distinct grill marks on the second side and are tender, for about another 5 minutes. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, drizzle with the tahini sauce and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.

    "DiffbotBody": "A team of researchers from MIT have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code. It turns out software and fruit have something in common: they both can rot. But while a banana that’s been sitting out too long can’t turn fresh again, old software code that no longer functions like it once did can be revitalized. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the university’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code, MIT said this week. This is a big deal for companies that might spend thousands of dollars on developers to restore old software that may not work as efficiently as it once did. Often times software programs written several years ago no longer function properly on the latest computers and hardware, explained MIT Professor Saman Amarasinghe in an interview with Fortune. The reason is because software has to be tailored to work for computers. Each time hardware technology advances and the performance of machines increases, a software program needs to get rejiggered to accommodate the changes. Typically, coders spend a lot of hours going through the program’s software to make changes, add more lines of code, and add algorithms that ensure that the software works efficiently with the hardware specs of the day. However, each time a programmer tweaks the software and adds new code, the program steadily becomes more bloated. Additionally, the algorithms and extra code used to match the software to current hardware specifications can often become invalidated as the next-generation gear launches into the market. Coders can have a difficult time removing all the extras, which leads to a program that experiences what is known as software rot. Once the code is rotten, the program as a whole can be slow as molasses and even unresponsive when you try to get it up and running. This is where the MIT researchers come in. The MIT team developed a software system called Helium that basically scans the rotten software, discovers the most crucial lines of code that the original programmers developed to make it function, and then builds a revised version of the program that works with the hardware specs that the MIT team wants it to match. What used to be a month’s long process, the MIT researchers claim can now be cut down to an hour. Amarasinghe explained that MIT tested out its Helium system with some engineers from Adobe ADBE -0.57% who were looking for ways to make the over-two-decade-old Photoshop program run faster and process images more quickly with the advancements in modern hardware tech. Whereas Google and Facebook have been running software that might be as young as three years, Adobe and other companies might have programs or applications that haven’t aged too well as the years have gone by, Amarasinghe said. In this case, the Adobe engineers wanted a way to make Photoshop run better without having to spend the traditional man-power needed to do the job. MIT claims that when they used Helium to revise Photoshop, the program’s performance increased by 75 percent. Say goodbye to the slow loading times for your favorite vacation pictures you want to make more colorful. As of now, Helium is not quite ready for primetime and it could be a few more years before it’s ready for widespread use, Amarasinghe said. Adobe was only testing out Helium and is not going to be using it in its products as of now. Also, while Helium can restore older code, it currently only works on image-processing software like Photoshop, because getting a program to display an image is a relatively easier task compared to other more complex software, he said. Still, if Helium pans out, Amarasinghe said it could have a lot of benefits to businesses. The healthcare industry, for example could save a lot of time having to upgrade their image-processing software for medical devices like X-ray machines as the hardware advances.

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

    "DiffbotBody": "The really hard work in De Standaard’s three-month historic series on the events that led to the beginning of World War I came after publishing — with on-going, specialised, and long-term marketing to its digital audience. Since we introduced a model for a paid Website, the focus of marketing is not so much on reach but on conversion, activation, and engagement. Our job as digital marketers is to bring as many people as possible to the paywall and convert them. But that’s not enough. Once readers take the step of paying for our content, we need to activate them as well. Many new members get a subscription because of a promotion (the iPad that goes with the subscription is quite often more important than the newspaper). Subscribers not only need to have a subscription, they must also use the subscription. The leaked New York Times memo put it this way: “We are putting less effort into reaching reader’s digital doorsteps than we ever did reaching their physical doorsteps.” At De Standaard, we are looking for ways to market and re-market the content to activate the digital reader as much as possible. That’s what we did with Tot aan de Ijzer. This is the first spread of Tot aan de Ijzer, which was debuted in the newspaper on July 28, 2014. That date was exactly 100 years after Austria declared war on Serbia, setting off World War I. This was the start of a series of articles in De Standaard that lasted for more than three months, discussing the German invasion of Belgium. Tot aan de Ijzer – “to the river de Ijzer” — is a detailed historic reconstruction of what happened when German soldiers invaded Belgium in August, took the major Belgian cities one by one, and were halted around Ypres. The series reported on the invasion, military movements, and political impact. De Standaard also published testimonials of civilians, soldiers, priests, nurses, writers, and the like, shedding a light on how the war was survived by the population. Much attention was paid to photography, drawings, cartoons, and infographics — a classic piece of journalism. We used to think our work was done after we put publish. Now we know it only starts after the publication. With the first publication, a promotional campaign drew the reader’s attention to the series. We communicate with in-newspaper ads, by mail, shared pieces on social media to give non-subscribers a taste. We bundled the series well, permitting the reader to easily find the articles. Three months later, a second cycle begins. We re-bundled the content into an ebook and promoted it through another channel. dS Avond is an app with evening news published at 5 p.m. Readers had to download dSA each day and start saving points from the edition. At the end of the week, a full saving card entitled you to an ebook-version of Tot aan de Ijzer (this was the first activation). And at the end of the year, we recycled the ebook and offered it with the print edition as a Christmas gift (voucher with unique download code inserted in the newspaper). By clicking on the box of the day, a coupon appears in the evening edition of dS (dS Avond). Every coupon counts for a downloaded issue of dS Avond. With the second activation, we offered the ebook with the newspaper and had extra newsstand sales of almost 3,000 copies during the weekend. Moreover, these buyers had to register so we collected extra data from an interesting group of non-subscribers. In terms of digital activation, it was a great tool: subscribers activated their digital account to read, and digital readership increased. As the content is the editors’ property, you don’t have any fee or royalty. So this is an extremely cheap way of marketing.

    "LabBody": "Ideas Blog. 30 June 2015 · By Emmanuel Naert. The really hard work in De Standaard’s three-month historic series on the events that led to the beginning of World War I came after publishing — with on-going, specialised, and long-term marketing to its digital audience. Since we introduced a model for a paid Website, the focus of marketing is not so much on reach but on conversion, activation, and engagement. Our job as digital marketers is to bring as many people as possible to the paywall and convert them. But that’s not enough. Once readers take the step of paying for our content, we need to activate them as well. Many new members get a subscription because of a promotion (the iPad that goes with the subscription is quite often more important than the newspaper). Subscribers not only need to have a subscription, they must also use the subscription. The leaked New York Times memo put it this way: “We are putting less effort into reaching reader’s digital doorsteps than we ever did reaching their physical doorsteps.” At De Standaard, we are looking for ways to market and re-market the content to activate the digital reader as much as possible. That’s what we did with Tot aan de Ijzer. This is the first spread of Tot aan de Ijzer, which was debuted in the newspaper on July 28, 2014. That date was exactly 100 years after Austria declared war on Serbia, setting off World War I. This was the start of a series of articles in De Standaard that lasted for more than three months, discussing the German invasion of Belgium. Tot aan de Ijzer – “to the river de Ijzer” — is a detailed historic reconstruction of what happened when German soldiers invaded Belgium in August, took the major Belgian cities one by one, and were halted around Ypres. The series reported on the invasion, military movements, and political impact. De Standaard also published testimonials of civilians, soldiers, priests, nurses, writers, and the like, shedding a light on how the war was survived by the population. Much attention was paid to photography, drawings, cartoons, and infographics — a classic piece of journalism. We used to think our work was done after we put publish. Now we know it only starts after the publication. With the first publication, a promotional campaign drew the reader’s attention to the series. We communicate with in-newspaper ads, by mail, shared pieces on social media to give non-subscribers a taste. We bundled the series well, permitting the reader to easily find the articles. Three months later, a second cycle begins. We re-bundled the content into an ebook and promoted it through another channel. dS Avond is an app with evening news published at 5 p.m. Readers had to download dSA each day and start saving points from the edition. At the end of the week, a full saving card entitled you to an ebook-version of Tot aan de Ijzer (this was the first activation). And at the end of the year, we recycled the ebook and offered it with the print edition as a Christmas gift (voucher with unique download code inserted in the newspaper). By clicking on the box of the day, a coupon appears in the evening edition of dS (dS Avond). Every coupon counts for a downloaded issue of dS Avond. With the second activation, we offered the ebook with the newspaper and had extra newsstand sales of almost 3,000 copies during the weekend. Moreover, these buyers had to register so we collected extra data from an interesting group of non-subscribers. In terms of digital activation, it was a great tool: subscribers activated their digital account to read, and digital readership increased. As the content is the editors’ property, you don’t have any fee or royalty. So this is an extremely cheap way of marketing. A second example of this type of promotion is a photobook called Altijd Ergens — a bundle of pictures of Michiel Hendryckx, a famous Belgian photographer who published his photos in dS Weekblad, our weekend supplement. We also made an ebook of this album and promoted dS Avond by using the same mechanism of saving daily coupons. This was also a big success, but more interesting were the diagrams of both promotions.

    "DiffbotBody": "One of the problems of the big data phenomenon is figuring out how to provide enough storage for the mind-bogglingly huge data sets being generated by scientists, researchers, governments, and private companies every day. The thing is, we’re making this particular dilemma worse all the time, because we’re creating and capturing more raw data than ever before. A study in 2013 found that 90 percent of all the data in the world had been generated in the preceding two years alone, creating huge logistical challenges for those whose job it is to make sure that this tidal wave of information is properly preserved for current and future purposes. So who’s the biggest culprit when it comes to generating untold amounts of data? If you guessed YouTube, you’re right. With people uploading some 300 hours of video to the service every single minute, it generates about 100 petabytes of data per year (ie. 100,000 terabytes, if that helps). Luckily, Google’s not exactly short of a buck, so it’s presumably got the resources to deal with the flood. But data generators in other areas might not be so well prepared. A new study by researchers at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the US says that the field of genomics is the fastest-growing data generator in the world today, with the quantity of genetic data being produced on a daily basis doubling every seven months at the current rate. The research, published in PLOS Biology, suggests that by 2025, genome scientists will be way ahead of YouTube and Twitter, and also the current reigning data kings in science: astronomy and physics. In 10 years’ time, genetics researchers will be producing somewhere between 2 and 40 exabytes of data every year, depending on how the rate of doubling pans out. (For those still paying attention, an exabyte is 1,000 petabytes.) \"For a very long time, people have used the adjective ‘astronomical’ to talk about things that are really, truly huge,” Michael Schatz, a co-author of the research, said in a press release. “But in pointing out the incredible pace of growth of data-generation in the biological sciences, my colleagues and I are suggesting we may need to start calling truly immense things ‘genomical’ in the years just ahead.” The researchers say the current level of genome data, estimated to be about 25 petabytes, is more than manageable, but that’s mostly because comparatively few people have had their genome sequenced. Indications are that this is about to change, with expectations that as many as 1 billion people will have their full genomes sequenced over the course of the next decade, mostly in rich countries. While the medical benefits posed by genome research are expected to offer some amazing health solutions within that timeframe, it sounds like the problems for the data scientists are just beginning. “Genomics is a game-changing science in so many ways,” said Schatz. “My colleagues and I are saying that it’s important to think about the future so that we are ready for it.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Peggy Woolsey Given the bacon mania sweeping the nation, it's not too difficult to imagine that Ari Miller, founder of the local bacon and charcuterie outfit 1732 Meats, is truly living the dream. Sitting in the office of his new production space in Yeadon, he explains, \"I'm the luckiest man on the face of the planet. I have a beautiful wife and amazing children who are so much smarter than me, and I can get up every morning and go to a job that I like doing. You can't beat that.\" Add a few slices of his signature Garlic Insanity bacon, a whiff of the lamb prosciutto that he has curing in the newly opened wholesale production facility, plus a roster of fantastic restaurants that have been using his meats regularly for a while now, it's not hard to understand where Miller is coming from. But like most people who are living the dream (whether bacon is involved or not), the story and the meats have been in the works for a while. Born in the Bay Area, Miller's childhood father-son bonding time was spent frequenting farmers markets, searching out the greasiest of greasy spoons and driving to Napa in search of small-production stinky cheeses. With a background like that, Miller's love of eating percolated on the back burner while he pursued a career in banking. The move to Philly happened in November 1998 by way of his wife and 1732 Meats partner, Elise. \"When a pretty lady says she'll marry you, you move,\" Miller says. Back then the food scene in Philly was nothing like it is today. Vetri was in its first years and aside from a handful of major players like Le Bec-Fin and Susanna Foo, the bar was pretty low, at least in Miller's recollection. \"There were five or six restaurants at the top and then there was a precipitous drop to everyone serving bad hoagies and cheesesteaks,\" he says. It was around that time that Miller set out to make his first batch of bacon. One fortuitous day a craving for garlic bacon came that he couldn't shake. It wasn't a product that he'd sampled before, nor was it available at the city's small selection of gourmet grocers. So in his typically industrious fashion, Miller bought himself a copy of the definitive Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking andCuring by Michael Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn. After an in-depth search for an essential curing ingredient, sodium nitrite (these were the days before everything-Amazon), Miller's amateur bacon-making experiment was up and running. Miller says that his wife likes to joke that he doesn't know how to cook for two or four people; when he hits the kitchen, there's enough for the whole neighborhood. And after a while, he started getting the response that so many gifted home cooks often receive when friends and family taste their wares: \"This is so fantastic! You should really go into business.\" Working as a branch manager of a Main Line bank, Miller's knowledge of customer service and what makes a successful business had been honed well enough for Miller to know that the restaurant business was not for him. But he was looking for a change. He decided to go back to school, not for cooking or hospitality, but for law. About a year and a half into taking night classes at Temple and working full time, he realized that becoming a lawyer wasn't his calling either. But instead of dropping out, he finished his degree and opted not to take the bar exam. \"I graduated in 2013,\" Miller says. \"And all I could see is massive amounts of free time and I don't do well with free time. I need something to do.\" Miller lives with his wife and two daughters in a Lansdowne home built in 1732 (hence his company's name) as part of the borough's founding farm. With a home base like that, his connection to the community runs deep. Seeing a lack of meat vendors at the weekly Lansdowne farmers market, Miller decided that it would be an ideal outlet for his bacon, and a way to combat all of that spare time. When he ran the idea by his wife, she had her fair share of reservations. \"Elise said to me fatefully, 'OK, but we're going to keep it small.'\" Miller explains. \"And I said, 'Absolutely.'\" With a 9,100-square-foot plant in Yeadon that opened in April, it's clear that Miller might not have told the full truth when talking to his wife that day, but that's not really a bad thing. Currently 1732 Meats makes four varieties of bacon (Garlic Insanity, black peppercorn, jalapeño and Spanish smoked paprika) and is getting ready to roll out a line of charcuterie in the next week or so that includes everything from pancetta to sumac-cured Wagyu bresaola, along with Italian classics like coppa and guanciale. Miller's meaty dreams are paying off big time. His meats can be purchased at all of the Di Bruno Bros. and Green Aisle Grocery locations as well as at the Fair Food Farmstead at Reading Terminal, and his charcuterie is going to hit the menus of plenty of restaurants in town very soon, including Brigantessa and Capofitto.",

    "DiffbotBody": "news Dearborn, Michigan has been completely taken over by Muslims, and now the police there are being forced to submit to Shariah law in a despicable way. It all started when a woman named Malak Kazan filed a lawsuit against the Dearborn Police Department after she was forced to remove her hijab for booking when she was arrested. The case was eventually settled out of court, but it inspired the police department to make some dangerous changes to their procedures. According to Conservative Tribune, the new policy will allow women to keep their hijabs on during booking, despite the fact that they could be hiding illegal weapons or materials underneath it. The policy will also ensure that a female officer, dispatcher, or employee will perform pat downs on Muslim women, instead of male officers. “I think this is the best policy that any local municipality or law enforcement agency can have for their inmates and Muslim women,” said Amir Makled, one of Kazan’s attorneys. “This will be used as the base line for all local enforcement agencies to set a policy and mirror what we have here.” Yes, you read that right: Kazan’s attorneys intend to fight for this to became a NATIONWIDE policy. This policy would open the door for criminals of both genders to hide all sorts of illegal materials under a hijab or a burqa. Women are not asked to take off their hijabs during booking to demean them: they are asked to do it for public safety. Policies like this represent the beginning of a potential Muslim takeover in the U.S. This has already happened in Europe, and we can NOT let that happen here! What do you think about this?

    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: First, stand barefoot and then rise onto your toes repeatedly. Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "DiffbotBody": "President Barack Obama is headed to a federal prison in El Reno, Oklahoma, next Thursday, the first trip of its kind for a sitting president. The trip, where Obama will meet with law enforcement officials and inmates, comes as part of his administration's focus on criminal justice reform, Politico reports. While at the medium-security facility, Obama will also interview with Vice for a documentary airing this fall on HBO. Obama is expected to further push the issue of criminal justice next week by commuting nonviolent drug sentences for dozens of federal prisoners. Julie Kliegman",
    "LabBody": "Trump's take. Donald Trump slams 'gotcha' journalism after he bombed a simple question about terrorism. FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images. The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Thirty. That's how many spaces Paul Frost looked at over the course of year while trying to set up his first solo venture, a globally inspired sandwich shop he dreamed up while working at places as diverse at Tangerine, Chifa, Kanella and the Talamore Country Club. Eventually, the Restaurant School grad settled on the cozy red-brick building on the corner of Front and Morris formerly occupied by BYOB Langostino. Done in white vinyl lettering, the catchy logo caught my attention, made me pull over and stare into the windows like a kid peering into a candy store. South Philly isn't short on great sandwich shops, but they don't happen to be concentrated in Pennsport, a neighborhood I'm constantly passing through. Frost opened 1st Ward in early June with a menu of riffs on between-bread classics like po' boys and grilled cheese —\"all things I used to make for staff meal,\" he says — plus salads, soup and sides. When I popped in for an early dinner after a biblical thunderstorm, it looked sunny despite the gray skies: soft ash floors, picture windows, white wainscoting, local art. But the fried cauliflower dish, tender florets tangy with lemon and sumac, was what really brightened my night. Served with a sidecar of chilled romesco, the perfectly cooked vegetable proved Frost's skill — and 1st Ward's ambition. This isn't your neighborhood hoagie shack. Pork belly braised half a day in hoisin forms the base for the banh mi, one of the two sandwiches I tried. The slices of pork were crispy and gooey in all the right places, their richness balanced by fresh cilantro and threads of house-pickled cucumber and carrot. Washington Avenue diehards might turn up their noses at the lack of pâté, or the predominant sweetness; my only complaint was the lack of fresh jalapeño, which would add a more complex heat than the smear of sriracha mayo. Served open-face on sesame bread, the mozzarella-eggplant sandwich was like a pair of giant bruschetta. Frost made the soft, supple mozz in-house; the wheels of fresh tomato were juicy and sweet, and the crowns of fresh greens streaked in balsamic lent it the vibe of a fresh Italian salad. The grilled marinated eggplant slices bordered on underdone; another minute on the grill, and they would have been perfect. I matched my sandwiches with a cone of slender, skin-on fries (crisp and well-seasoned) and a class-defying spring mix salad furnished with Gorgonzola, dried cherries, candied pumpkin seeds and Dijon vinaigrette. I would go out of my way to eat at 1st Ward again. Fortunately, I don't have to reroute — and soon, that might be the case for sandwich feigns who don't live in South Philly. Frosts hopes to open locations all around the city. This first one is a good start.",

While there are certainly pros to a job that immerses you in the lives of the rich and powerful, it can also reveal the ugly side of humanity. Assistants see everything — from their employer’s daily schedule to their most intimate moments. It can feel like a roller coaster, with a boss acting like a demon from hell one minute and gifting their assistant an expensive bag the next. Bosses everywhere have their quirks, but a town like Los Angeles — with its abundance of celebrities and moguls — can breed a particularly terrifying species. Being an assistant might as well earn you a degree in the psychology of human behavior. And while some former assistants would prefer to leave their traumatizing employment experience in the past, there are the ones who have felt scorned enough to write a juicy memoir. Read on for seven scary stories from former assistants with bosses from hell, from a germaphobe actress to a Miranda Priestly wannabe.

    "DiffbotBody": "Scientists have figured out how to separate the pain relieving qualities of medical marijuana from its psychological side-effects in an effort to offer people a new high-free option. The research focussed on the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, known as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is not only responsible for the high associated with the drug - plus hallucinations, delusions, memory loss, and feelings of anxiety or calm - it’s also been shown to slow tumour growth in mice. And now, scientists have figured out that the mechanisms by which the drug delivers its desired medical effects and negative psychological effects work independently from one another - which means that one can be switched off while the other one works its magic. \"There has been a great deal of medical interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms at work in THC, so that the beneficial effects can be harnessed without the side-effects,\" one of the team, Peter McCormick from the University of East Anglia in the UK said in press release. \"THC acts through a family of cell receptors called cannabinoid receptors. Our previous research revealed which of these receptors are responsible for the anti-tumour effects of THC. This new research demonstrates how some of the drug's beneficial effects can be separated from its unwanted side effects.\" When investigating how THC is able to shrink tumours, the researchers figured out that negative psychological side-effects of the drug, such as memory defects, mood swings, anxiety, and paranoia, were triggered by a single pathway in the brain that was separate from the pathway that triggers the drug’s cancer-killing properties. In an effort to better understand the drug’s ability to cause these negative effects, the team isolated this particular pathway and experimented on it in mice. They noticed that two types of cell receptors were present in this pathway - the cannabinoid receptor and the serotonin receptor - and these happened to be positioned very close together, which suggested that the drug was acting on both at the same time. To figure out what effect this was having, the team blocked the activity of a specific type of serotonin receptor - called 5HT2AR - in the brains of mice, and gave them a dose of pure THC. The mice were then put through memory, behaviour, pain, and motor skills tests. \"These animals, lacking the serotonin receptor, showed differences only in the memory and mood tests - not in the pain tests,\" McCormick told Liat Clark at Wired. \"There were no side effects in memory, and that's exactly what we were looking for.\" Reporting the results in PLOS Biology, the team says with 5HT2AR turned off in mice, the THC was still able to reduce pain as well as tumour growth, but without the negative psychological effects. What they want to do now is figure out if the same mechanisms are in play in human brains, and then see if they can mimic the same serotonin receptor-blocking effect they achieved in the mice. McCormick calls this effect a \"Chinese wall\" that sits between the serotonin and cannabinoid receptors, and thinks it could be the key to medical marijuana without the negative side effects. \"For me, the ideal drug would be in one of two scenarios: a drug that does not recognise the THC cannabinoid receptor when near serotonin, or alternatively a drug you could add with THC that would provide that Chinese wall between the two,\" he told Wired.",

    "DiffbotBody": "You know the big problem with gigantic lunar craters, right? They’re absolutely freezing! This not only makes them an inhospitable habitat for humans, but even robots designed specifically for a space environment can experience operational and maintenance problems if exposed to the shadowy cold of the Moon for too long. But what if you could reflect sunlight directly into the heart of a lunar crater to generate a warm, well-lit environment that’s better suited to the needs of robots and their kindly human overlords? That’s the thinking behind NASA’s audacious ‘Trans-Formers for Lunar Extreme Environments’ project - one of several new research projects the US space agency greenlit this week. The project involves navigating a rover unit to the rim of a crater, where it will erect a ‘TransFormer’ mirror array to reflect sunlight into the darkened cavity below, with the goal of generating enough warmth and light in the area for experiments to be performed remotely by other robots down at the base. According to Adrian Stoica of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “The TransFormer (TF) concept is a paradigm shift to operating in Extreme Environments (EE). TFs are systems that direct energy into energy-depleted (extreme) environments, transforming them, locally, around robots or humans, into mild micro-environments.” The effect could be amplified by several TransFormer units working in unison, catching different angles of sunlight to provide “continuous collective illumination”, he said. The TransFormer plan is one of seven projects in NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. The goal of the initiative, which awards as much as US$500,000 in funding over the course of a two-year research grant, is to nurture “visionary ideas that could transform future NASA missions with the creation of breakthroughs - radically better or entirely new aerospace concepts - while engaging America’s innovators and entrepreneurs as partners in the journey”. In other words, it’s NASA’s version of the Google ‘Moonshot’ philosophy. Except literally, in some cases, and performed by the very people who invented Moonshots in the first place. The other concepts that have made it through to Phase II of the NIAC program are no less adventurous. They include the Titan Submarine, designed to explore icy oceans on cold planets; Swarm Flyby Gravimetry, which pilots a fleet of small drones around asteroids and comets in order to map their gravitational fields; and the Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (HERTS), a solar sail designed for speedy return trips to outer planets in our Solar System within one to two years of launch. “This is an excellent group of NIAC studies,” said NASA’s Jason Derleth in a statement. “From seeing into cave formations on the Moon to a radically new kind of solar sail that uses solar wind instead of light, NIAC continues to push the bounds of current technology.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "A different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. How exactly does one follow up , the surprise-hit, male-stripper melodrama that catered to a heated audience (mainly female, slightly male) but served them a cinematic buffet concocted by skilled storyteller Steven Soderbergh? Easy. You take the show on the road. To that extent, Magic Mike XXL is the most accurate depiction of male entertainers road-tripping from Tampa to Myrtle Beach for an annual convention that Hollywood has ever produced. If you only see one movie this summer about male strippers bonding over unfulfilled dreams while they titillate female clientele, make sure it’s this one. Why? Because it’s great. Magic Mike XXL often operates as the movie Entourage desperately wanted to be – or worse, actually thinks that it is. It’s 100% bro-powered, telling the low-stakes story of impossibly handsome dudes living their irregular lives, and inviting us along for the intimate ride. But the camaraderie and mutual respect – the Zen-like “chi” that’s preached and practiced by the men of Mike -- is as organic as unforced as Entourage was artificial. As a result, Magic Mike is believable, embraceable, and worthy of celebration. Where Richard Donner’s Superman once inspired us to believe that a man can fly, Magic Mike XXL convinces us beyond a shadow of a doubt that a dancer can leave the stage behind and open an ice cream truck that has a DJ booth attached -- entertaining the masses and satisfying their sweet tooth at the same time. Picking up shortly after Magic Mike concluded, the sequel finds Mike (Channing Tatum) struggling to get his carpentry business off the ground when a phone call summons him back to Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), the freewheeling choreographer and club owner, has jumped ship, leaving beautiful but dense dancers “Big Dick” Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan, (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tito (Adam Rodriguez) rudderless. Sensing that their stripper endeavors are drawing to a close, the guys agree to venture to South Carolina for one last blowout bash at an annual dancers’ convention. Along the way, Mike convinces them to ditch the routines that Dallas burned into their individual memories (“You are not a fireman, Richie”) and embrace new routines that come from the heart. And the crotch. But mainly from the heart. Magic Mike XXL pulls off a legitimate magic trick, recognizing the expectations of its suddenly sizable fanbase and somehow exceeding them. Magic Mike XXL isn’t surprising anyone this time out. The original film cost roughly $7 million, but went on to gross a massive $167 million, fuelled by female curiosity, the magnetism of Tatum (and his co-stars), and legitimately positive word of mouth that proclaimed Soderbergh crafted a moving soap-opera in a seedy, sweat-soaked Tampa strip club – the unlikeliest of cinematic communities. Audiences came to the theater with crumpled up singles, but left Magic Mike with soggy tissues, emotionally buying in to the ongoing struggles of these three-dimensional dancers. A sequel was inevitable, and with it comes change. Soderbergh opted to stay in his self-imposed “retirement,” handing the directing duties over to longtime collaborator Gregory Jacobs (though Soderbergh did contribute to XXL as a cinematographer and editor, explaining why this follow-up has the same sweaty, late-night shimmer of the first film). And now that he has an Oscar on his shelf, McConaughey chose to hang up Dallas’ leather chaps and opt out of the fun. No bother. His mystical aura is usurped by a larger-than-life Jada Pinkett Smith, who slinks across the screen and deliberately swipes every scene as Rome, an uber-confident and confidence-boosting Savannah strip club owner who welcomes Mike back into her world of empowerment. Like Dallas, Rome resembles a character we only think exists on screen in stories like Mike XXL, and I wondered numerous times during her unique scenes if this person, and her establishment, actually exist. Moving forward, however, I don’t need more Rome. Quite the contrary. I’d be thrilled if each Magic Mike sequel found a new character actor willing to fill the “role” of outsized Mike mentor, the way McConaughey and Pinkett Smith already have. Wait, subsequent Magic Mike movies? You better believe it. Magic Mike XXL is a different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining… by design. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and surprisingly unpredictable. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. XXL sheds the heaviest baggage of Soderbergh’s initial foray, keeping just enough drama to ensure tension, then filling in the gaps with unfiltered bro-heavy chemistry. It’s a winning formula, and one that proves that Mike’s world is one worth revisiting, just to spend time with these friends. We spend a lot of time talking about developing Cinematic Universes for characters who don tights and capes. What about the guys who slip out of their super suits to entertain? Don’t they deserve their own multi-film series? If and when Magic Mike XXL matches the box-office bar set by the original, it’s time we start having that conversation.",

    "DiffbotBody": "On the Grid From the shale fields to the cooling towers, Trib Total Media covers the energy industry in Western Pennsylvania and beyond. For the latest news and views on gas, coal, electricity and more, check out On the Grid today. 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Saturday, July 11, 2015, 12:01 a.m. WASHINGTON — Parents may hesitate to hand teens the keys to the family car, but Congress is proposing to allow drivers as young as 18 to get behind the wheel of big rigs on the nation's interstates. Federal regulations require drivers be at least 21 before they can drive commercial trucks across state lines, but a bill introduced this week by Republican senators would allow contiguous states that join together in “compacts” to drop the age threshold to 18 for interstate trips. There is no limit on the number of states that could join the compacts. After four years, the Transportation secretary is supposed to report to Congress on whether teens have “an equivalent level of safety” in comparison with older truckers. In 2013, all drivers ages 18-20 had a fatal crash involvement rate, per 100,000 licensed drivers, that was 66 percent higher than drivers who were age 21 years or older, according to the Transportation Department's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, although the total number of crash deaths among teens has been declining since 2002. The change was sought by the trucking industry to help address a shortage of truck drivers. The American Trucking Association estimates that the current shortage of drivers is roughly 35,000 to 40,000, but because of retirements and individuals leaving the industry, trucking companies will need to recruit nearly 100,000 new drivers a year over the next decade to keep pace with the country's freight needs. But Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said allowing teens to drive trucks weighing as much as 80,000 pounds and to work as many as 82 hours a week, as is permitted in the truck industry, is a “catastrophe waiting to happen.” “The combination of inexperience, high-risk driving and large trucks can cause unbelievable devastation,” she said. Dave Osiecki, chief of advocacy for trucking associations, said states already allow teens to drive commercial trucks unlimited miles within their borders. For example, it makes no sense to allow a teen truck driver to drive hundreds of miles from one end to the other of a state like Virginia, but prohibit the same driver from crossing the Potomac River into Washington, he said. “We absolutely support” lowering the age limit, he said. “It would be good for our industry, it would be good for commerce, it would be good for the economy.” Legislation to allow states to lower the age for a commercial, interstate license to 18 was first introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and was incorporated into a larger transportation bill introduced this week by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Fischer. The bill would restrict teen truckers from hauling hazardous materials or operating “special configurations,” which are generally defined as oversized or overweight loads. States and the U.S. Department of Transportation would also be allowed to impose other restrictions if they wish. States wouldn't be obligated to join the compacts, but Gillan said she expects state officials would be under pressure from the trucking industry to do so. To obtain an interstate commercial driver's license, drivers must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test administered by a state motor vehicles department. But there is no requirement that drivers first receive on the road training or attend a training school, Gillan said. Labor unions have said the driver shortage could be eliminated by raising truckers' wages and improving working conditions. A decade ago the Bush administration looked at lowering the commercial truck driving age to 18, but ultimately decided against doing that because the public comments the government received were overwhelmingly against the idea.

    "DiffbotBody": "About 15 to 20 residents crowded New Market’s town hall Thursday night to comment and question representatives about the planned development for the 262-acre property, which was annexed into the town in 2014. Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Remember this moment from the 2012 campaign trail? Well, it turns out Romney was right. Again. According to congressional testimony given by General Joseph Dunford earlier this week, Russia is the biggest threat to the United States as President Vladimer Putin continues aggression not only in his region, but by reaching out to the enemies of the United States. \"Russia presents the biggest threat to our national security,\" Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"In Russia we have a nuclear power. We have one that not only has the capability to violate the sovereignty of our allies and to do things that are inconsistent with our national interests but they're in the process of doing so. If you want to talk about a nation that could pose an existential threat to the United States I have to point to Russia.\" Throughout the course of nuclear negotiations (which are ongoing after multiple deadlines were missed) between the U.S. and Iran, Russia has openly cozied up to the terrorist regime. Earlier this year, Putin put 40,000 on alert for military exercises and he's also been reaching out to the Chinese, who just hacked extremely sensitive information belonging to more than 20 million Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. will cut an additional 40,000 Army troops by 2017.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Commentators are probably right in assessing that Brianna Keilar’s CNN interview with Hillary Clinton was not quite the love-in that many of us anticipated. (See Jim Geraghty’s review of the Clinton interview, here.) Still, you have to mourn the media’s lack of self-respect: as Jim pointed out in Wednesday’s Morning Jolt, Mrs. Clinton blatantly lied when she claimed, “I’ve never had a subpoena” from a congressional committee regarding Benghazi. There was nothing subtle about it. Clinton was totally banking on CNN’s inclination to let her slide. Well, they don’t call it the Clinton News Network for nothing. It is the network of Candy Crowley, who in the middle of a presidential candidates’ debate couldn’t restrain herself from inappropriately challenging – and misleadingly correcting – Mitt Romney’s remarks about Benghazi. But somehow, when Benghazi came up in a one-on-one media interview setting, CNN couldn’t bring itself to call Mrs. Clinton on an obvious lie. It is well known that Mrs. Clinton was subpoenaed in March by the House select committee investigating the Benghazi Massacre. The matter is indisputable. Plus, it was Keilar who brought up the subject of the subpoena, so one has to assume she did a modicum of research – which is all it would have taken to be ready to challenge Clinton’s false assertion. Yet, in the context of being asked about her destruction of emails from her private server, Clinton was permitted to tell the public she had not been subpoenaed. Thus, without impunity, she was able to frame suspicions that she has willfully obstructed probes of the Benghazi Massacre as outlandish. Jim notes that, in March, Chairman Trey Gowdy’s Benghazi committee released a public statement reporting that it had “issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya.” Moreover, we also know that Benghazi Committee Democrats – apparently thinking it would help Mrs. Clinton(!) – publicly released a March 27 letter from Clinton’s counsel, David Kendall, in which the subpoena is acknowledged and analyzed at length. In the letter (which Shannen Coffin discussed here at National Review back in March), Kendall states that the Committee issued a “subpoena duces tecum” – essentially, a subpoena that compels the witness to produce documents. The subpoena demanded production of “documents, for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.” Those would be (a) the eight months before the September 11, 2012, Benghazi Massacre, when security at the State Department compound was reduced despite jihadist attacks and an intensified terrorist threat, and (b) the three-and-a-half months after the attack, when the administration misled the public about the nature of the attack and identity of the attackers while trumping up a prosecution against the producer of the Innocence of Muslims video, on which the administration fraudulently blamed the murders of four Americans. The documents called for by the subpoena are those “referring or relating to” the following for categories: “Libya (including but not limited to Benghazi and Tripoli)”; “Weapons located or found in, imported or brought into, and/or exported or removed from Libya”; “The attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012”; “Statements pertaining to the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012.” There is no question that the subpoena was issued to Mrs. Clinton personally. Kendall says it was “issued by the Benghazi Select Committee to the Hon. Hillary R. Clinton.” Furthermore, by mutual agreement between the committee and the Clinton camp, it was served on Mrs. Clinton, apparently by delivery to her agent for that purpose (probably Mr. Kendall’s firm, but the letter doesn’t say). Kendall is Mrs. Clinton’s personal attorney, and his letter states that the subpoena was “served by agreement on March 4, 2015.” Given that Chairman Gowdy is an experienced litigator and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton was represented by counsel, it was consistent with professional ethical rules to arrange delivery of the subpoena – and discuss the subpoena thereafter – with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer. And, of course, Mrs. Clinton is also a lawyer with congressional committee experience – she is well aware that service of process upon a witness’s agent by consensual arrangement with witness’s lawyer is the legal and factual equivalent of personal service on the witness. In addition, it is quite apparent that Kendall could not have written a letter extensively responding to the subpoena requests without first having discussed the subpoena with his client, Mrs. Clinton. When Hillary Clinton told CNN, “I’ve never had a subpoena,” she was lying. Since that is what Mrs. Clinton often does, a reporter who fails to challenge her – in an interview for which the reporter had lots of time to prepare, and on a subject the reporter brought up – must be either incompetent or colluding in the lie. Such collusion might be because the reporter supports the candidate, the reporter and her network want to maintain access the candidate, or both. I don’t think Ms. Keilar is incompetent.",

The other day Chris Brown had a few words for his baby mama Nia’s mom amid news outlets confirming he will indeed take Royalty’s mom to court so a judge can make sense out of their child support drama, and he’s claiming the issue is Nia is asking for $15,000 a month. However, Nia’s camp tells TMZ that the real reason Chris filed the paperwork is because he’s mad his mother got to spend a day with Royalty on his watch, without his say so. TMZ writes: Sources close to Nia tell TMZ … Royalty’s parents finally came to an agreement on child support … settling on $10k per month from CB, starting July 1. As we reported, Chris’ camp said Nia initially wanted $15k, but he only wanted to pay $2,500. We’re told the new deal blew up though, when Daddy wanted Royalty this week — but she was already hanging with grandma in Virginia. Since relations between Chris and his mom have been bad for years now … our sources say Chris got pissed. We’re told Nia’s claiming this is the first time she’s ever denied Chris visitation, but looks like once was enough.",

'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By Jonah Goldberg Friday, July 10, 2015, 8:57 p.m. Poor Donald Trump. It wasn't supposed to be like this. For years, wherever The Donald went, he met people who told him he should run for president. His retinue of sycophants surely saw little to gain from explaining that “birthers,” celebrity worshippers and devotees of “The Apprentice” are not a statistically meaningful sample of the electorate. In the past, Trump always pulled back from the brink. Why risk his beloved TV show? Why endure the embarrassment of revealing he's not as rich as he pretends? Flirt but don't commit was the rule. But something changed. One too many Twitter followers said, “Do it!” One too many valets whispered, “America needs you” — probably just before asking for a raise. And Trump took the leap — though he hasn't provided the required financial disclosures yet, which inclines me to think that he will either suddenly find an excuse to retreat or that he has a team of accountants trying to figure out how he can simultaneously save face and avoid perjury. In his announcement speech — the brevity and discipline of which were impressive only by the standards of Fidel Castro or Joe Biden — Trump shouted his certainty that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals to America, but he could only “assume” (sotto voce) that “some” of those Mexicans are good people. Trump's commitment to the GOP has often been situational. Sure, he has put his money where his mouth is, but he's as promiscuous with his mouth as he is with the Trump brand. He's given money to Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Andrew Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and the Clinton Foundation. Asked to explain why, he said, “You're gonna need things from everybody.” (One does wonder what Trump hoped to get from the Clinton Foundation.) This attitude helps explain why Trump is such a fan of eminent domain. The man seeking the tea party's support loves to use the government to seize private land he can't — or doesn't want to — buy fairly. Given the fetid swamp of sanctioned corruption that passes for commerce in New York, it's no wonder he sees nothing wrong with greasing the skids by funding liberal politicians. The great irony is that the man who made his fortune playing the game of influence-peddling and celebrity-mongering forgot that the other players get a turn. Trump has lost his TV show. Macy's will no longer carry his menswear. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who governs like a banana republic demagogue, has declared that he is reviewing Trump's contracts with the city. Meanwhile, too many of Trump's GOP primary competitors, afraid of angering his fans, stand mute or mumbling. Republicans are fielding the best candidates in a generation, but Trump is poised to make them chumps by association. He has no chance of becoming president, but he has the huge potential to deny his alleged party a White House victory in 2016. And when that happens, he will of course stay a celebrity, but he will have traded his fame for infamy, even among those now cheering him on.

    "DiffbotBody": "When Vecernji list saw a need — that readers wanted a venue to run and walk for exercise — the news media company started its own school, the “GoOUT School of Movement.” Here are seven lessons learned from this profitable initiative. At Vecernji, we have directed all of our thoughts to creating new revenue streams in the last several years. We are trying to create a community of fans around our niche media platforms (print and digital platforms) by producing relevant and useful content, which will support and participate in our non-publishing projects. The growing trend among all generations to participate in outdoor activities encouraged us to launch a niche bi-monthly magazine GoOUT and accompanying digital platform 18 months ago, since publishing is still our core business. Analysing the needs of people, we concluded that across all age groups they are most interested in running/jogging and in Nordic walking for the 50+ age group. At the same time, a market analysis showed that sufficient capacity does not exist in clubs or schools to absorb all of this interest. These findings led us to an idea to establish our school, at first only in the capital city of Croatia. That is how the “GoOUT School of Movement” originated as a logical complement to the previously mentioned media platforms. After the initial idea, about which everyone been very enthusiastic (after everyday stresses, most of us the best relaxation finds in running), we were faced with several challenges. We didn’t know anything about organising this kind of school. We didn’t have professional trainers. We didn’t have a location or permits. And, most importantly, we didn’t have an allocated budget. We had to go one step at a time. Initial business plan been made and we found that project could be mostly financed from monthly memberships and the sponsorship of related companies that were interested in reaching this target group/community. For professional assistance, we turned to the Faculty of Kinesiology, with which we reached an agreement in a very short time (much to our very great surprise) – five trainers for the running school and seven trainers for the Nordic walking school. The next step was to select a location and obtain a permit. We selected four locations, in consultation with the professional team of trainers, we designed the programms. Since the programmes involved running and walking, several training programmes for different weight classes, age groups and physical capabilities were set up. Babysitting would be provided in the morning and afternoon periods at two locations for the children of parents who were running or walking. This service was a unique offer on the market because no other school had it. We completed all of these preparations in 30 days and were ready to launch our sales effort! We simultaneously started sales to future attendees, exclusively using for promotion all of the media platforms of our house with BTL (below-the-line) activities at the locations — open houses and test trainings —nd to our potential sponsors (multi-vitamin drinks, sportswear, shoes, gadgets, vitamins, etc.). That was in September 2014. The goal was to start the school in November. We knew that it wasn’t the best time of year for outdoor activities, but we still decided to start (if we could get the required money from sponsors and enough potential participants) and to introduce the project by the spring of 2015, when the peak season begins. In the first wave, we concluded two-year contracts with two main sponsors and we started the school with a 130 attendees, who trained three times a week divided into seven groups and different time periods. In this way we ensured a satisfactory profit after covering the project costs (trainers, baby sitting, T-shirts for the attendees, etc.). Today, the school has around 400 attendees and 21 groups, and our profit margin is growing month by month. In addition to the regular trainings, we have also organised two running races and two Nordic walking excursions in the mountains, open to anyone who is interested. Revenues from the registration fees for these events and the revenues from smaller/one-time sponsors are “icing on the cake” within P\u0026L. We can now safely our project is a success — with a current profit margin is 60%. At a time when all media companies, or at least a majority of them, are faced with a constant decline in classic revenues, we have learned that a good project without an allocated budget can still be launched and create extra profit for a company. For us, the definition of a good project means several things: To create a community of readers by quality content around niche media platforms. To recognise the needs of that community and to find empty space on the market. To create additional services or products that satisfy those needs an charge them. To maximise existing resources and to gather a team (project management, marketing, sales) to launch and implement a project that believes in its success. To constantly add new elements to a project that will in the long term keep the existing users and attract new ones. To create unique environment for potential sponsors based on the needs of the target group. To optimise costs and for promotion to use only our own media platforms if the portfolio provides sufficient reach, as in our case. (Small niche publishers can try to link up with larger media companies on a revenue-sharing principle in exchange for media space). Preparations for the next season have already begun. We will organise even more extra events, and the school can perhaps start to operate in other larger cities across the country. We are certain that new successes are coming!

Who doesn’t love the idea of viewing and interacting with 3D holograms brought to life right in front of your eyes? The applications for entertainment and gaming are off the charts, but the implications for augmented reality in education and science are also undoubtedly massive. And now, Microsoft has teamed up with Case Western University in the US to show us what this might look like in an actual human anatomy class video demonstration. Human anatomy has been taught via two-dimensional representations of body parts for centuries, and even though in more recent times computer software has introduced various kinds of pseudo–3D anatomical models on 2D displays, none of these can rival the interactive holograms that HoloLens is capable of projecting (to the viewer’s eyes, at least). “With HoloLens, you can see the muscles on top of the skeleton, all at the same time. You can bring them in and out, and exactly understand where things sit,” says Mark Griswold, from the university’s radiology department. “You can take any anatomical part and show any of it,” adds Satyam Ghodasara, a medical student studying at the university. “You can move it around, you can make it kind of translucent so you can see through the outside, and that really helped me understand how cardiac anatomy worked.” The holograms will also enable anatomy and medicine students to learn things they wouldn’t be able to learn from studying living people. Bodily organs can be viewed and interacted with in isolation from other parts of the body, helping students to learn how they look and function.

    "LabBody": "A terrifying moment at a Wisconsin amusement park was caught on camera Wednesday when the bungee cords for “The Catapult” ride snapped moments before launching two riders into the air. Footage captured by the father of one of the riders shows the line suddenly snap and go screaming toward the ground. The incident occurred at the Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells. “Holy s***!” an individual was heard saying on camera. “Oh my God!” This is our son Trevor Larson and Carrie Sueker attempting to ride the catapult at MT Olympus at the Wisc Dell's! Wait till you see this!!! Posted by Dru Larson on Wednesday, July 8, 2015. “Good thing it didn’t land on them,” another individual echoed. Following the incident, Mount Olympus said in a statement to WMTV that the ride will be removed from the park. “The Catapult” was owned by a vendor and not Mount Olympus, the theme park added.

    "DiffbotBody": "Uber and Lyft have taken to prices slashes in Manhattan as they continue to fight. The battleground of the ride-hailing war has now moved from San Francisco to Manhattan. On Friday, bitter rivals Uber and Lyft, both of which offer on-demand rides with the tap of a mobile app, announced price slashes to their carpooling services in Manhattan. So, if you’re looking for a ride and don’t want to grab a taxi, here are your options: UberPool: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan, as long as it starts and ends south of 96th Street, and it will cost $10 at most (or less if the distance doesn’t reach $10 per Uber’s fare math), and regardless of whether you get matched to carpool with another rider. Uber says this is for a limited time, so keep an eye out for announcements in case it changes. Lyft Line: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan as long as it starts and ends south of 97th Street (note the extra block), and it will cost only $5 even if you’re not matched with another carpooler. The catch is that this only works for one rider. If you are with a friend, you will be charged $1 dollar for both of you to get into the car. Gett: This Israeli car service contender has been quieter than Uber and Lyft, but it’s been offering $10 rides anywhere in Manhattan south of 110th Street since last September. Oh, and you don’t have to carpool and you get to ride in a fancy black car. Uber and Lyft have been running this playbook in San Francisco for several months now, and prices have fluctuated. Manhattanites should expect these deals to be temporary. New York’s city council is also expected to consider a proposal that would halt these services’ expansion by capping the number of cars they can add every year, so any of the above could be affected. Lyft recently agreed to pay $300,000 to settle a city complaint. At least New York still has a pretty good subway system…",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Daily Mail, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s been a rough few weeks for Sarah Palin… Last month, the country was shocked when her daughter Bristol Palin called off her wedding to Sgt. Dakota Meyer just days before it was set to take place amidst claims he had been married to a “secret wife” years before. Weeks later, it was revealed that Bristol is currently pregnant with her second child out of wedlock, and she has no plans to get married anytime soon. In the middle of those scandals, Fox News parted ways with Palin when they decided not to renew her million dollar contract last month. Now, Palin has just quietly announced that she will be shutting down the subscription-based sarahpalinchannel.com just a year after it debuted. According to Mediaite, the site offered exclusive Palin content for an annual subscription fee of $99.95, and they will now be giving a refund for the remainder of the year to all customers. Here’s the full statement the Palins put on the website: Effective August 1st, the Governor will be making all of her content free on her Facebook page and at SarahPac.com. • If you are a monthly subscriber here on SarahPalinChannel.com, you will not be charged anything after this month. There’s nothing that you need to do. • If you are an annual subscriber, you can have the balance of your subscription refunded to your credit card or you can roll your subscription into one of the other channels on our network. If you choose this option, you’ll get an EXTRA month absolutely FREE. Our networks include: – New Life TV – Recharge your relationships and grow closer to God – Alive with Joan Lunden – A vibrant community for women’s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors – K-Love TV – Christian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values Palin also issued a video message in which she did her best to make the change look like a positive thing. “It’s starting August 1st, everything’s free, and just to let you know, that it is an honor to have you subscribe, really it’s been so illuminating and still is so illuminating to read and to respond to many of your insightful comments about current events, about so many things going on in our world today,” Palin said in her video message. She went on to claim that this decision to make all content free stems from a desire to, “make sure that your voices and mine are heard by the widest possible audience across this great land of ours” during the next election. While this sounds nice, it also reveals that Palin was not getting the amount of subscribers she was looking for. She would not be making all the content free if she was making a good amount of money with subscribers, so this change reveals that Palin is not doing as well business-wise as she might have thought. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the entire Palin family. We need to keep them in our prayers!",

    "DiffbotBody": "City Paper grade: B+ You've never seen anything like Matthew Heineman's , a shot-from-the-hip documentary that follows the fight against Mexican drug syndicates from multiple sides. Heineman, who often composed a camera crew of one, insinuates himself into a methamphetamine cook run by masked bandits who bear little resemblance to Bryan Cranston; trolls alongside a self-appointed border patrol agent on the U.S. side whose jingoistic beliefs shade into predictable racism; and, most profitably, shadows the charismatic leader of an anti-cartel militia in Michoacán, Mexico. José Manuel Mireles Valverde, a small-town physician whom his followers call \"El doctor,\" takes a bold stand against both drug traffickers and the corrupt national government, but the movie quickly reveals his increasing power fomenting its own moral struggles. Mireles' Autodefensas aren't picky about whom they label a cartel associate, leading to some terrifying scenes where you feel seconds away from watching an innocent person gunned down in the street, and as the militias become more powerful, they, too, become objects of the cartels' graft. Heineman's attempt to run the vigilantes' stories on both sides of the border in parallel — despite the fact that one is fighting a largely imaginary threat, the other a very real one — leads to tricky questions never quite reckons with. But it's undeniably thrilling, even as the ends to which that aesthetic is put to use remain disquieting.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The trio of brothers running Sunshine Market in Lynnwood, at the corner of 212th Street SW and 44th Avenue W, are serious about their fruits and vegetables.They stand behind their products, support local farmers and try to be there for their customers nearly every day of the year, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and until 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, said Noor Almtowaq, 29. And they'll stay open later if a customer drives in at closing time, he said.He's the eldest brother and the driving force behind the purchase of the stand, which they opened in September 2013.“Noor's the heart of the entire business,” said 26-year-old Alex.Yet Noor now works at Microsoft, finding time mainly on weekends and some nights for Sunshine Market, and it's Alex who's hooked on produce.“He has so much passion for the business,” said younger brother Josh, 22. “It's like he fell in love with produce.”Alex agreed and said he's not likely to fall out of love anytime soon either. In fact, he's searching for a site for a second, bigger store where he can expand the selection. He dreams of a string of stores offering both conventional and organic produce. He said there's a science to understanding how fruits and vegetables work — “for example, potatoes hate light, bananas love heat, asparagus loves water” — and in understanding how to sell produce.“When you put tomatoes, basil, eggplants and ginger next to each other,” he said, “it's a guarantee you're going to sell them all.”He's always been interested in how things work. Younger brother Josh said Alex was the kind of kid who was forever taking things apart and putting them back together. He studied at Edmonds Community College and earned an engineering degree from the University of Washington, because he wanted to understand the technology behind materials like concrete.“I'm an inventor and my imagination was limited because I didn't understand the materials, so it limited me,” Alex said. Understanding materials “grew my imagination,” he said.The brothers didn't start out planning to go into the produce business.“I didn't even know what cilantro was, to be honest,” Josh said.Prodded by Noor, they were just looking for a business. And they liked the Lynnwood location. Perched on a hilltop at a busy intersection with three corners anchored in Mountlake Terrace, the site overlooks a Lynnwood business district and streets leading to the Alderwood Mall and I-5. It's housed a produce stand at various times in the past, as well as a coffee stand, sometimes both at once. But there were few, if any, improvements to the building and nothing seemed to last for long. That changed when the Almtowaq brothers took over the site. It was Alex who almost singlehandedly rebuilt the building, doing everything the city would let him do by himself. He redid the electrical and plumbing, built the shelves and an awning for shade. He installed new siding and garage doors that can slide up to open an entire side of the building. “He built this whole entire building all by himself,” Josh said. “He's really smart. I used to come down and watch him.”Todd Hall, planning manager for the City of Lynnwood community development, said the brothers made “significant modifications” to the building and their business is apparently running smoothly.“Since they've come in, we haven't had any complaints or anything,” Hall said. “It seems to be going really well.”The brothers said they made a lot of mistakes and their first customers didn't expect Sunshine Market to last long.At first, they didn't have proper coolers and their produce wasn't being sprayed with water to keep it fresh. So Alex installed coolers and bought the software for a state-of-the-art sprinkler system. “My spinach now lasts two weeks,” he said. “I won't leave it in the store two weeks, but it lasts two weeks. When I first opened, I couldn't even get it to last three days.”Customer Kainitra Crammer, who lives in Bothell but works near Sunshine Market, said she loves the freshness of the produce. She can put it in her fruit bowl and it won't attract fruit flies because it's not spoiling right away, she said. “It's not the grocery store's produce,” she said, “and you can clearly tell, because of the way it lasts.”The brothers order from independent local farmers and smaller outfits like Peterson Fruit Co., a family-owned business in Mukilteo. Often it's a customer request that brings a new product into the store. That's how the brothers started carrying raw milk from Jackie's Jersey Milk in Bellingham. They started out selling 18 bottles a week and now sell 90.They also sell fresh goat milk, which is even harder to find; theirs comes from Lucky Hook Farm in Moses Lake.“People drive from like, Arlington and stuff, just to come buy it,” Josh said.They also sell organic eggs from Stiebrs Farms in Yelm, fresh every three days, he said. And duck eggs, which he described as “a very rich egg” beloved by Asians. Another big seller is their raw honey, purchased from a beekeeper with 46 beehives ranging from Mill Creek to Walla Walla, Josh said.“It is like, the best honey out there,” he said, adding, “We believe 110 percent in our honey.”There are also familiar items like chocolate milk from Twin Brooks Creamery in Lynden, coconut water, Bulgarian feta cheese and Beechers Cheese. Other jarred and canned products give a nod to the brothers' Middle Eastern roots. There's olive oil from Lebanon and Tunisia, coriander from Pakistan, Turkish figs, dolmas and cornichons, tahini paste and dates.Although they consider themselves Americans, the brothers fled with their family from Iraq in 1992, in the wake of the first Gulf War. Aided by Red Cross and United Nations workers after crossing into Saudi Arabia, the Almtowaqs made their way to Washington state, living in Everett for a time and then Lynnwood. His family history may explain in part why Alex has studied philosophy and history and seems just as prone to discussing Plato, Socrates and Galileo as he is to talking produce.Indeed, the conversation at Sunshine Market seems to be part of the customer service.“One of the coolest things here is being able to meet with the brothers,” said store regular Doug Clark, maneuvering through the market in his wheelchair. “And since I'm disabled, they actually have excellent customer service.”He's also partial to the produce, he said.“I've gone up to the Yakima fruit stand, just to compare prices and quality,” he said, “and I just turned around and came back here.”Retired media-arts teacher Claire Beach, of Edmonds, called Alex's impassioned explanations his “TED talks,” referring to the short, powerful talks made popular by the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences.She chatted with Alex on a recent visit, but that didn't distract her from the produce, which she said has helped her recover from a serious illness. She's been following an anti-inflammatory diet, including cutting down on carbs, and has lost 40 pounds and regained her vigor, she said.“This is the first time in my life I'm eating what my body wants,” said Beach, adding that she grew up in the South. “I was raised in Betty Crocker Land.”Customers like Beach are inspiring, Alex said.“When people come back and they tell you they feel better, healthier, stronger — it's a good feeling,” he said. “It keeps you going.”He could be making a lot more money as an engineer, but said he doesn't like sitting behind a desk.“Engineering is a hobby,” he said. “It's something I do because I love it.“But selling produce is different. You're selling something that feeds the entire world.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project.

    "DiffbotBody": "The attorney for the parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, said the decision not to prosecute the veteran sergeant seemed “preordained.” Mawuli Davis, the Thomases’ layer, said the investigation into the March 24 shooting was tightly controlled from start to finish by Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds, who presented his findings Thursday to a grand jury that concluded Sgt. Kenneth Owens’ use of deadly force was justified. “There has not been a level of transparency,” as Reynolds promised, Davis said. Felicia Thomas, mother of Nicholas Thomas, speaks as her son Triston “TJ” Thomas comforts her during a press conference at Davis Bozeman Law Firm in Decatur on Friday. The parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, felt “disrespected and discouraged” by the process that culminated Thursday with a grand jury’s recommendation not to prosecute the veteran sergeant, the family’s lawyer said. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM Nicholas Thomas’ mother said she learned Owens would not face charges on television, “the same way I found out my son was” killed. Davis blasted the Cobb D.A. for meeting with the media Thursday before reaching out to his clients. “Rather than have a private meeting with the family, they had a private meeting with the media,” said Davis, adding the Thomases felt “disrespected” by Reynolds. Felicia Thomas, mother of Nicholas Thomas, speaks as her son Triston “TJ” Thomas comforts her during a press conference at Davis Bozeman Law Firm in Decatur on Friday. The parents of Nicholas Thomas, fatally shot in March by a Smyrna police officer, felt “disrespected and discouraged” by the process that culminated Thursday with a grand jury’s recommendation not to prosecute the veteran sergeant, the family’s lawyer said. HYOSUB SHIN / HSHIN@AJC.COM “This is an absolute effort to control messaging,” he said. And the message delivered to reporters was not altogether factual, said Davis, noting that a press release announcing the grand jury’s decision stated that Smyrna and Cobb police “attempted to arrest Mr. Thomas on a felony probation violation warrant.” Thomas was actually being sought for a probation violation stemming from a conviction on a misdemeanor charge of possessing one ounce or less of marijuana. Davis said he is eager to find out what evidence was presented to the grand jury. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has submitted an open-records request and was informed it would receive the entire case file sometime next week. Of particular interest will be any information explaining why Owens felt compelled to shoot. Of the five officers dispatched to the Cumberland Parkway Goodyear, where Thomas worked, Owens was the only one to draw his gun. Thomas tried to elude the officers, jumping into a customer’s Maserati, a detail neither side disputes. With the only exit blocked by police, Thomas drove around the building twice. Owens told investigators he shot at the Maserati because he feared Thomas was going to run over an officer who was behind him. It’s a different narrative than the one provided immediately after the shooting, when Smyrna police told reporters Owens shot at Thomas to save himself. Davis said it’s no coincidence Owens’ story changed after it was revealed the fatal bullet entered through Thomas’ back. Co-counsel Rob Bozeman said he wants to know whether that other officer feared for his safety and, if so, why he didn’t feel the need to draw his gun. “It seems obvious that officer could’ve defended his own life,” Bozeman said. The Thomases’ lawyers said they have notified Smyrna police and Owens of their intent to file civil litigation. Felicia Thomas said she will continue to pursue justice for her son, who left behind a young daughter. “God has the last word, not Vic Reynolds,” she said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Mark Stehle Twelve cellblocks come together in a central vestibule where a skylight two stories above provides sunlight. Nestled just above the visitor's entrance to Philadelphia's House of Correction hangs a small wooden sign, painted blue, with \"Welcome\" written on the front, right next to the image of a grinning snowman. \"You'll see how hot it is when we get inside,\" one of the jail's corrections officers says as he ushers me through the lobby — full of whirling fans — and into Warden William Lawton's office for a quick chat. Lawton, a large man, is seated at the end of a long conference table, hunched over some paperwork. To his right, a large flat-screen television hangs from the wall, dormant, right next to a floor-to-ceiling tapestry of the late comedian Bernie Mac, who is shooting a thumbs-up right back at Lawton. This room, at least, has air conditioning. \"My grandson calls this the 'transformer jail!'\" Lawton says. \"He says, 'You're always transforming things to make them work.'\" Lawton, who has worked within the Philadelphia Prison System for 37 years, has been the House of Correction's warden for the last three. \"We've converted space for classrooms, for medical facilities, all of which were not parts of the correctional mindset 200 years ago.\" He tells me he's tired of repairing cracks in the ceiling, tired of sealing leaky pipes, tired of working in a jail built in 1874, then rebuilt using the same bricks in 1927. \"Our keys don't have an automated locking system,\" he says. He mimes unlocking a cell door, twisting one of his hands at the wrist. \"They're made out of brass. We have to special-order parts for them.\" And, on a steamy almost-summer day like today, he's tired of the weather: The jail, built along the same floor plan as the fortress called Eastern State Penitentiary, has no central cooling system. \"Today, it's hot, but unfortunately I can't take my population out to the mall,\" he says, chuckling. \"And the heating system is quite old, but unfortunately, winter still visits us all.\" He swings his hand out and points to a spot on the wall, just behind Bernie Mac. \"This wall is 8 inches thick! It's a real wall,\" he says, implying that it'd be nearly impossible to install new vents or pipes. \"There's no fire-suppression system here. If the place were to catch fire, we'd need to unlock each cell, one by one. It's hard just to provide the humane to people. \"There have been plans to replace this place for 15 years,\" he continues. \"But it just hasn't worked out.\" **** Lawton's concerns echo, almost word-for-word, those of City Councilman Bobby Henon, who has been trying — at Mayor Michael Nutter's request — to replace the House of Correction with a brand-new jail. Henon, a sturdy man with a thick helmet of iron-gray hair, was the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union's political director before winning a seat on Council in 2011. Henon's 6th Council District includes the neighborhoods of Mayfair, Frankford and Holmesburg, home of the House of Correction. In February, Nutter's office released its annual six-year capital program plan, which conspicuously included $4.9 million to purchase land for \"prison expansion potential.\" On April 30 Henon introduced Bill 150406 — which would let the city spend up to $7.2 million to buy a parcel of land at 7777 State Road, adjacent to the House of Correction. He chose, however, to hold the bill after the City Planning Commission voted 5-0 against the plan. (A number of Holmesburg residents also spoke out against the idea.) Both Henon's and Nutter's camps claim now is the right time to get started, mostly because there's land available: The House of Correction, which housed 1,492 lower-security prisoners as of Sunday, is a crumbling, perennial money-suck, Henon argues. Rather than spend millions to renovate it, building a new facility on the State Road property (which, interestingly, is owned by a limited-liability company called 7777 Philadelphia Pa Loan Associates, though Henon says the company is owned by BNP Paribas bank) makes far more sense to Henon, both monetarily and from a human-rights standpoint. The House is falling apart and should not be used to hold prisoners, Henon says. (Nutter also asked for $5 million this year to repair the jail's roof.) Critics have launched a full-scale attack on the plan, contending that building a new jail would likely cost the city between $300 million and $500 million, money City Council can never seem to find when it comes to funding Philly's impoverished School District. Henon has countered that money for a new jail would come from the city's capital budget, which comes from funds borrowed against municipal bonds, rather than its operating budget, where money for the schools is allocated. Though Henon argues that the capital budget is not funded directly by taxpayers, most of his opponents haven't bought his logic. Fellow Councilman Curtis Jones Jr. has been, perhaps, Henon's most vocal opponent on Council: \"Yeah it's two different budgets, but it comes out of your same pocket,\" he told WURD 900 AM radio host Solomon Jones. The city's General Obligation bonds, which would fund a portion of the land purchase, are repaid from the city's general tax revenues. Likewise, a number of prison-reform advocates believe the city should instead streamline its Department of Pretrial Services. There are currently 8,113 inmates in the Philadelphia Prison System's six facilities: Besides the 1,500 at the House of Correction (which theoretically is supposed to hold 1,250), about 2,700 men sit inside the city's largest jail, the Curran-Fromhold Correction Facility, which opened in 1995. Likewise, the 50-year-old Detention Center holds around 1,200; the Philadelphia Industrial Correction Center, opened in 1986, holds roughly 1,000; and the Riverside Correctional Facility, the city's sole female-only jail, holds 750 women. However, around 6,000 of the 8,000 people sitting in the Philadelphia Prison System are currently being held pretrial, many of them because they are unable to post bail. \"Our position on it is that the House of Correction should be closed,\" said civil rights lawyer David Rudovsky, when asked about what ought to happen to the jail. He insisted, however, that a new one should not be built. \"If you build it, you're gonna fill it. That's how prisons work.\" \"The jail population can be safely lowered to a point that new beds would not be needed,\" he added in an e-mail. Henon could have brought the land purchase to a vote during Council's final four legislative sessions in May and June but he held on to the bill after protesters, many of them members of the prison-reform advocacy group Decarcerate PA, flooded some of the meetings. On June 17, he sent it back to the Public Property Committee, saying he'd use the Council recess to speak to more constituents before bringing the bill to vote again in the fall. I sat down with Henon in his office on City Hall's fourth floor on June 29 to parse out what his plans were going forward. \"I agree that we need to cut down on the pretrial process, and the incarceration rates,\" he said. \"Decreasing the population should be addressed. But if you decrease the population from its current number to 6,000, there still will be a need for a House of Correction.\" He went on, stressing, as he has on numerous occasions, that his plan does not \"add\" a prison to the system: \"Once the new one is built, the old one will be shut down.\" He mentioned to me, however, that the proposed new jail would have 2,500 beds, a 1,000-bed increase over the existing House of Correction. Henon says the bed increase won't lead to a population increase. He says the new beds should just allow men throughout the system who are being held in triple cells to move to two-man cells in the new facility. But an increase in beds does not necessarily lead to a decrease in overcrowding. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Prisons increased overall capacity of federal prisons in this country by 8,300 beds from 2006 to 2011, only to see its levels of crowding increase as well, due to an increase in arrests, according to a 2012 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. According to a Pew Charitable Trusts report, Philly's jail population peaked at 9,787 inmates in 2009, before falling to around 7,700 in 2011. The population is now about 400 larger, mainly for two reasons. Mayor Nutter in 2012 asked the city to begin issuing higher bails to those accused of gun crimes, effectively punishing inmates before they've been convicted. The second reason has to do with a 2009 Inquirer series about men and women skipping bail in Philadelphia: In response, the city created a Bench Warrant Court in 2012 to crack down on bail fugitives. Earlier this year, the city received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation to look into ways to decrease its jail population. Through everything, one point remains undeniable: Absolutely no one should be sitting inside the House of Correction. **** Back out in the main lobby, visitors enter and exit, and guards shout to be heard over the sound of the fans. The air is thick, soupy and stale-smelling. Capt. Joe Browne, one of the jail's chief corrections officers — tall, with gray hair, a long face and the wide stance of a man prepared to break up a brawl — leads us out of the lobby. We go through a small courtyard wrapped in barbed wire, through a metal detector and come up to a thick metal gate. On the other side is a hallway with doors to the jail's schoolhouse, medical center and visitation room. Inmates, clad in blue, line up along the right side of the central hallway as they wait to enter the visitation room. Most stare at the ground. A guard jams a thick, brass key into the door and swings it open with two hands. The visitation room seems standard, if a bit low-budget: Prisoners sit in plastic chairs, arranged in rows and their visitors sit facing them, about 2 feet away, just far enough to make it difficult to touch. \"They're allowed to hug and kiss each other good-bye,\" Shawn Hawes, a prison spokesperson, tells me. An air-conditioning unit the size of a vending machine drones on, drowning out what is being said. **** The original House of Correction was built — ironic as this may now sound — to alleviate overcrowding. In response to a prison system absolutely swamped with inmates, the city in 1861 convened a Joint Committee on the Erection of a House of Corrections, which issued a report that is still available at the Philadelphia Free Library's Central Branch. James J. Barclay, then the president of the city's Board of Managers, wrote that in 1859, the city's prisons were so overstuffed with victims of \"intemperance\" that more than 7,000 people were discharged for \"want of room\" in that year alone. Sadder still, the system was, even in the 19th century, clogged with inmates being held pretrial: At Moyamensing Prison, which stood at 1400 S. 10th St. from 1835 to 1963, men slept three to five to a cell, and there were \"hardly 50 cells to spare for the number of untried criminals alone.\" So, to hopefully relieve some of the system's congestion, the city got to work on the original House of Correction, which opened in 1874. \"All through the 19th century, there was this really strong belief that isolation was good,\" says Sean Kelley, a prison historian and director of interpretation and public programming at Eastern State Penitentiary. \"The model for the original House of Correction would have undoubtedly been solitary confinement.\" The House's board of directors kept detailed records through the jail's first few years of operation, noting that the facility became overcrowded almost immediately. A year after opening, there were more than 1,500 inmates inside, and board members had already begun petitioning the city to buy more land. \"I cannot too strongly recommend the purchase of additional property,\" one remarked, after noting that there was not enough farmland surrounding the prison to properly feed the inmates. By 1876, the overcrowding had become worrisome: The facility processed 8,074 inmates, and, at any point in the year, typically held more than 2,000. The building was knocked down in 1925 and rebuilt, opening again two years later. \"It's hard to emphasize enough how much it looks like Eastern State,\" Kelley says. \"It looks shockingly similar. It's medieval.\" He says, however, that 100-year-old prisons are common across the country. \"Nineteen twenty-six is, sad to say, not that old of a prison in the scheme of things.\" Kelley adds, \"These things are really built to take abuse. They're built to withstand people who want to intentionally harm them. What they build might be around for the next hundred years.\" **** With the door closed, the prison Learning Lab feels like an elementary school classroom. There's a large teacher's desk in the center of the room, and the walls, painted a light blue, are covered in bright-colored posters espousing the joys of English and arithmetic. Mid-2000s-era PCs line the back wall. These, I'm told, are used to administer G.E.D. training. \"Most of our inmates are testing around the fifth-grade reading level,\" says Hawes, the prison spokesperson. Wayne Jacobs, a former inmate who now heads X-Offenders for Community Empowerment, a group that helps parolees find employment after leaving prison, told me he believes the city ought to be relying more on G.E.D. training programs to keep those awaiting trial out of the permanent prison population. \"The city should begin to look at those 1,500 prisoners to see how many are willing to go to drug treatment, mental-health treatment, G.E.D. job readiness while they're waiting to go to court,\" Jacobs says. \"They can easily send those folks to those particular programs. They should increase their pretrial-services budget, so they can be able to place people on house arrest in those programs. This way, we will be able to empty out the House of Correction.\" Angus Love, executive director of the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, which provides legal services to those in prisons, jails and state hospitals, agrees. He believes the city can reduce its population to far fewer than the 6,000 Henon talked about. \"New York City reduced its population,\" Love says. That city's prison population dropped from 22,000 in 1991 to 13,200 in 2009, largely because the city reduced the number of people it arrested on drug charges, according to a report compiled by the Vera Insitute of Justice, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the nonprofit JFA Institute. By city population alone, Philadelphia ought to have a quarter of New York's jail population, Love said, \"but we over-incarcerate. If we invest in alternatives to incarceration, like mental-health treatment, we can bring the population down to three to four thousand, and they could fit inside Curran-Fromhold.\" A few feet down the hall, through an open door, sits the jail's mental-health screening ward. It is, simply put, a paltry excuse for an intake center. There are three small desks for the social workers that assess prisoners, and only one desk sits behind a small door that can be shut to preserve privacy. Today, because the door is open, I peer in and an inmate waves at me and shouts, \"Hello!\" as if we're neighbors running into one another at the bank. A social worker, who asked not to be named, points to a chair next to her desk. \"If I'm talking with a patient, he sits right here, and everyone can hear him,\" she says. I ask if she'd prefer to work in a new facility. \"Ooh,\" she says, pausing for a moment. \"Actually, no. I believe we need to invest more in schools than in a jail. But I think if we focused more on childhood intervention, we'd keep a lot of people out of this system.\" **** The jail's central vestibule sits at the end of the hallway. Standing inside, one gets the sensation of being down in a large pit; the room is semicircular, the bricks are the color of dirt and gray sunlight streams through a skylight vaulted two stories above the ground. Here, 12 hallways arranged like spokes on a wheel meet, each blocked off with an iron gate. We enter one hallway with cells holding 164 prisoners. There's a ruddy shower room at the beginning of the hall, across from a pay-phone bank that appears to have been cleaned even less often than the showers. Exposed copper pipes snake up and around the walls. As we walk, one of the pipes emits a hiss, and water drips down and collects in a puddle on the floor. The entire floor, for that matter, has a film to it. We pass cell after cell. The doors are neither the sliding-style seen in cartoons, nor the thick, gray kind used in most maximum-security prisons. They are, instead, short, hobbit-hole-looking wire grates that may very well have been hand-assembled. There's a tiny porthole in each. Some men stick their faces through them to stare at us, while others lay on their bunks, some shirtless to combat the heat, some with towels over their faces. Browne opens a cell and orders two men out so we can enter. \"Relax, they're not here to search your stuff,\" he tells them. About the size of a college-dorm room, the space houses three men. The walls are stark white, and a copy of the Daily News sits on the bed to the left. To the right, there are two bunk beds, each no bigger than the average human body. Wawa milk cartons sit on the windowsill. Above the sink, in one of the corners, the ceiling has cracked and is beginning to cave in. Wire mesh covers the window, and it's impossible to see anything outside, only whether it's day or night. The air feels heavy and damp, and it's difficult to breathe. On the way out, Browne stops to chat with a group of inmates waiting to head to visitation. Most keep their eyes fixed on the ground. \"Do you guys have any opinions about the House of Correction?\" he asks them. No answer. \"C'mon, guys! I'm serious.\" \"It sucks,\" one inmate says. \"How's the food?\" Browne asks. \"Shitty,\" an older inmate leaning against a gate says, without looking up. \"See?\" Browne asks, turning to me. \"No coercion at all.\"",

The Texas senator's book ranks fourth on The Wall Street Journal hardcover list and fourth on the Publisher's Weekly hardcover list, Politico points out. And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. These haters on the Republican side will not be pleased with a new poll that has revealed Trump is the top GOP challenger in North Carolina. According to Conservative Tribune, Trump topped the poll with a whopping 16% of the vote. Jeb Bush and Scott Walker tied for second with 12% and Mike Huckabee came in right behind them with 11%. The poll was conducted by the Democrat-leaning Public Policy Polling found that Trump’s surge was due mostly to an increasing favorability rating among men and young people. “Trump’s favorability rating in North Carolina is 55/32, much higher than we were finding in national polls prior to his entry into the race,” PPP’s report said. “Trump’s really caught fire with voters on the far right — 66% of ‘very conservative’ voters see him favorably to only 24 percent with a negative view of him. Trump is polling particularly well with younger voters (29 percent) and men (20 percent).” They added that Trump’s numbers are being boosted by conservative independents in particular. “Among ‘very conservative’ Republicans, only 37 percent see him favorably to 44 percent who have a negative opinion of him and only 7 percent of those voters support him for the nomination, putting him in seventh place in the GOP field,” PPP continued. The PPP found that Hillary Clinton still has the lead among Democrats in North Carolina, with her polling in at 55%. However, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her with 20% of the vote. Are you a Trump supporter? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.",

    "DiffbotBody": "In his first book, author Jason Smith explores the depravity and desperation required to maintain an opiate addiction so fierce, he finds himself jumping continents to avoid jail time and learns the hard way that some demons cannot be outrun. While teaching in Europe, he meets a prostitute who secures drugs for him at the dangerous price of helping out the Russian mafia; in China, he gets his Percocet and Xanax fix but terrifies a crowd of children and parents at his job in the process; and in Mexico, Smith thought a Tijuana jail cell would be the perfect place to kick his Fentanyl habit, but soon realizes that the power of addiction is stronger than his desire to escape it. The Bitter Taste of Dying paints a portrait of the modern day drug addict with clarity and refreshing honesty. With a gritty mixture of self-deprecation and light-hearted confessional, Smith’s memoir deftly describes the journey into the harrowing depths of addiction and demonstrates the experience of finally being released from it.",

    "DiffbotBody": "At the end of June, the Greek government instituted capital controls — limits on how much money can be drawn from banks — after negotiations with the eurozone broke down and the country's fiscal and monetary lifelines disappeared. Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

It has been 10 years since we’ve sold a home, and something seems to have become popular: “staging.” I have been married 50 years and in that time have sold seven homes. Four of them sold to the first people who saw them, so I feel I have some insight into how to present your home for sale: Fresh paint where needed; an attractive yard and entry; clean windows, floors and rugs; heating and cooling units in good condition; and a minimum of personal items. But today, that doesn’t seem to be enough. I am told by realtors that I must “stage.” I have to get rid of anything, including furniture and paintings, the stager deems offensive. I should set the table as though I am about to serve dinner, put out champagne and glasses by the bed, and basically set it like a model home. We are told this is what people expect. Can this be true? What happens if the house doesn’t sell for a year? I’ll have to dust the dishes on the preset table for my imaginary guests and invest in a lot of champagne if I have to do this every time there is a showing. I’m all for new fluffy towels, but so many of the other suggestions seem frivolous. I pity someone with small children if this is what it takes to sell a house now. – Curious Dear Curious: People who make their livings setting up homes for sale will of course try to convince you that you need to do this, but it’s all a matter of degree. A house that looks like a model home is going to create a more positive impression than one that looks unkempt. But most buyers expect a house to be in good shape structurally and include the elements they want. They’d rather see the toilets flush properly than have champagne by the bedside. This is why buyers should hire a reliable inspector before finalizing the sale. An attractive presentation is lovely, but it’s all gravy. Those who buy a home based primarily on a nice table setting deserve what they get.",

Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. A man was found shot dead in a car on a little-used road in Clairton early Friday. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man as Derek McCellan, 44, of Clairton. Acting Clairton police Chief Robert Ferry said the victim was found in the driver's seat of a Kia rental car by a passerby who was on his way to work. The discovery was made around 6:20 a.m. near the intersection of Chambers Street and Broad Avenue. Ferry said the road is not a well-traveled one. “He was parked there,” Ferry said. “He was probably down there for a while.

Lifestyle Changes MayoClinic.com states that smoking can create deep wrinkles around your mouth and speed up your skin's natural aging process. Stop smoking to prevent deep wrinkles from forming or getting worse. Sun exposure can also lead to wrinkles around your mouth. If you go out in the sun, apply sunblock to your face to prevent the sun's ultraviolet rays from worsening your wrinkles or creating new wrinkles around your mouth.",

Start by stretching your mouth as wide as you can, as if saying \"cheese.\" Hold the position for two seconds, then pucker your lips together tightly so that your lips almost touch your nose.
