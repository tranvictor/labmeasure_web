    "DiffbotBody": "[ PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 2016 ] Republican presidential candidate former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signs autographs following a town hall meeting Wednesday, July 8, 2015, in Hudson, N.H. JIM COLE | THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: Saturday, July 11, 2015 at 12:09 a.m. Last Modified: Saturday, July 11, 2015 at 12:09 a.m. WASHINGTON | Jeb Bush has shattered political fundraising records with a $114 million haul in the first six months of the year, an extraordinary total designed to instill a sense of shock and awe into his Republican competitors. Now, Bush and his allies have to figure out how to spend it. They reported Thursday they have collected more than $114 million through the end of June and reported $98 million in the bank, likely at least twice as much as his next closest Republican competitor and more than the outside group backing President Barack Obama in 2012 raised in two years. \"More than the symbolism of surpassing $100 million, the totals demonstrate Bush's success charting new territory,\" said Bush donor Mark Jacobs, a former Texas energy executive who now lives in Iowa. Bush's team \"has raised more and been more successful than any political organization ever.\" Yet in some ways, now the real test begins. He helped raise the money, but Bush has no direct control over 90 percent of his new haul. The total announced Thursday includes $103 million raised by Right to Rise, a super PAC that will support Bush in the crowded GOP contest. The rest, $11.4 million, came into Bush's formal campaign. By law, the super PAC can't take direction from Bush's Miami-based campaign, and the two operations have limits on how they can communicate. Based in Los Angeles, Right to Rise will handle a huge part of the costly work of running for president, including buying TV, online and radio commercials, conducting polling and even doing some organizing tasks such as voter outreach in early primary states. Bush's official campaign and its markedly smaller bank account will pay for his travel and employee salaries, and give him a pot of money from which to craft messages exactly as he sees fit. Designed with longtime aides Sally Bradshaw, who now leads the campaign, and Mike Murphy, who now leads the super PAC, it's a strategy untested in modern politics. Right to Rise already is advertising on Bush's behalf. It has spent $47,000 so far on digital media, according to documents filed this week with the Federal Election Commission. The group has also inquired with broadcast and cable stations in the early primary states about booking TV ad time. The campaign's broader strategy — and continued fundraising efforts — will be a focus this weekend as Bush gathers with top donors at his family's Kennebunkport, Maine, compound. In exchange for gathering $27,000 worth of donations in the first 15 days of the campaign, donors were rewarded with an \"evening picnic\" with Bush and his parents, former President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and a morning \"political and campaign briefing\" with senior campaign officials. In announcing its fundraising Thursday, Right to Rise said it had about 9,400 donors who had given $25,000 or less, and about 500 who'd given more. Having made its mark in the big-money chase, the Bush campaign is focusing now on finding and cultivating small donors— people who would chip in $25 or so a few times over the Internet. Separately, Jay Zeidman, a Houston-based fundraiser for Bush, said the campaign is focused on continuing to build on its initial $11.4 million because \"those dollars are very, very important. It's the front lines, the boots on the ground. The campaign is definitely front and center now.\" While the super PAC can accept unlimited donations, Bush's formal campaign operates in far more restrictive territory. Individual donors can't give more than $2,700 to the primary elections and, if Bush wins the GOP nomination, $2,700 he can spend in the general election. In all, Bush's campaign raised $11.4 million — or an average of $710,000 per day — through the end of June. The campaign touted that daily average as more than the average of $562,000 per day raised by Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton since she launched her campaign April 12. Clinton's haul in that time totaled $45 million. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition. All rights reserved.

    "DiffbotBody": "LONDON— Tom Hayes, the alleged mastermind of a global interest-rate-rigging conspiracy, said that he decided to fight charges against him after discovering in 2013 that his former employer, UBS AG, had what he called an “instruction manual” for manipulating rates. Mr. Hayes, who broke down in tears on the witness stand Friday, is accused by British prosecutors of eight counts of fraudulently trying to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. For several months in 2013, he cooperated with British prosecutors, admitting his guilt and planning to testify against his alleged co-conspirators. It was part of an attempt to avoid extradition to the U.S., which charged him with fraud and antitrust violations in December 2012. As part of his process of cooperating with British prosecutors, Mr. Hayes said he was shown an internal UBS spreadsheet that appeared to spell out exactly how the bank’s Libor submitters should skew rates to benefit their trading positions. Mr. Hayes said he was “flabbergasted” when he saw that document. “I read that document and it corroborated what I already knew.... It did give me some confidence that I can fight this.” He said it convinced him that UBS was guilty of “sheer hypocrisy” for singling him out as a ringleader when in fact the company appeared to condone skewing Libor for trading reasons. UBS has previously pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of Libor manipulation. Later in 2013, Mr. Hayes decided to stop cooperating with the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office and to fight the charges. Mr. Hayes, who has been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, is the first person to stand trial for allegedly manipulating Libor. He says that he is a scapegoat, that Libor-rigging was commonplace in the market and that his superiors at UBS and Citigroup Inc. C 2.10 % condoned his tactics. Part of his defense is that he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong and that he only admitted dishonesty and wrongdoing to the SFO in order to get charged in Britain and avoid extradition. On the stand Friday, asked by his lawyers to tell the jury why he initially cooperated with prosecutors, Mr. Hayes appeared to be overcome with emotion, bowing his head and welling up with tears, as he described his mental state in early 2013. “I knew what I thought and what I wanted to say, but I knew I couldn’t say it,” he said. “What I wanted to say is, ’I’ve not done anything, it was just my job, and I’m not dishonest.’” His wife, Sarah, sitting in the audience, also cried. The trial was briefly adjourned to allow Mr. Hayes time to compose himself. Friday was Mr. Hayes’s fourth day on the stand. Next week he will be cross-examined for the first time by prosecutors. A UBS spokeswoman declined to comment, citing English contempt-of-court rules.",

Federal and state authorities raided the home of Subway pitchman Jared Fogle on Tuesday, just two months after the then-executive director of Fogle's foundation was arrested on child pornography charges. Authorities wouldn't describe the nature of the investigation or what they hoped to find on electronics removed from Fogle's house. Fogle's attorney said his client, known by millions as \"The Subway Guy,\" was cooperating with investigators. Subway said in a statement that it believed the raid was \"related to a prior investigation\" of a former employee of the Jared Foundation, an organization founded by Fogle to raise awareness about childhood obesity. The company didn't say whether that employee was former foundation executive director Russell Taylor. Federal prosecutors in May filed a criminal complaint charging Taylor, 43, with seven counts of production of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. Investigators said they discovered a cache of sexually explicit photos and videos Taylor allegedly produced by secretly filming minor children at his home. Fogle issued a statement after the charges were filed saying he was shocked by the allegations and was severing all ties with Taylor. Fogle declined to comment as he left his home Tuesday, the hood of a blue rain jacket pulled over his head. Attorney Ron Elberger said in a statement that his client had not been arrested or charged. \"Jared has been cooperating, and continues to cooperate, with law enforcement in their investigation of unspecified charges, and looks forward to its conclusion,\" Elberger said. Subway removed references to Fogle from its website and issued another statement, saying the two had \"mutually agreed to suspend their relationship due to the current investigation.\" \"Jared continues to cooperate with authorities and he expects no actions to be forthcoming,\" the company said. \"Both Jared and Subway agree that this was the appropriate step to take.\" Fogle, 37, became the restaurant chain's pitchman after shedding 245 pounds more than 15 years ago, in part by regularly eating Subway sandwiches. Subway began featuring Fogle in commercials soon after, and his story was instrumental in giving the sandwich chain an image as a healthy place to eat. Neighbors said Fogle and his wife entertained frequently and would say hello but that they didn't see the couple outside a lot. Jacob Schrader, 19, who lives across from Fogle's house, said the pitchman seems \"like a pretty private guy\" and that he'd only seen him about a dozen times in the last five or six years. \"He's like an endangered species or something like that,\" Schrader said. » Comment or view comments taboola sponsored listings",

But this much is certain: With glorious shots of the ancient links and its enchanting surrounds filling up the telecast, you’ll be pining to pay the Auld Toon a visit. You know where you’re playing: the Old Course, Kingsbarns, Crail, and, if you care to venture a bit further north, mighty Carnoustie. But where are you staying? Options abound, for all tastes and budgets. Here are seven of the best places to lay your wind-battered bones. This beloved, iconic hotel has always been notable thanks to its location overlooking the Old Course's 1st and 18th holes. Now it is notable thanks to its style and fine dining. All 70 bedrooms recently have been upgraded and many wholly refurbished. And its restaurant, Rocca, is run by Michelin-rated chef Davey Aspin and now offers dining worth traveling for — and not just because it overlooks golf’s greatest arena. (Try the Orkney rib-eye steak with dauphiniose potato, cauliflower gratin, and a red wine sauce.) The Rusacks makes a cameo at the beginning of the 1981 film, Chariots of Fire. Following the famous training run on the West Sands beach (where Old Tom Morris used to take a quick swim every morning), the action moves to the hotel, showing it off in all its Edwardian glory. Rooms from about $385; Pilmour Links, St. Andrews, +44 (0)1334 474321 St. Andrews is awash with B\u0026B’s. Some are professional outfits, others homespun. The best of the bunch are along Murray Place and Murray Park, where almost 20 guesthouses line walkways just a two-minute walk from the Old Course. Cleveden House is one of the most popular, a tightly run ship with excellent rooms and scrumptious breakfasts. Charlie Huldal and his wife Ray run the place with plenty of charm. Charlie is a former captain of The New Club (a golf and social club housed along the 18th fairway of the Old Course), so his golf chat is excellent, second only to his porridge, which has been voted best in the country. It’s a thing of creamy deliciousness more than virtuous healthiness. Double rooms start at $140 in the high season; 3 Murray Place, St. Andrews, +44 (0)1334 474212 The Old Course Hotel is the one you recognize from watching the Open on the “telly.” It’s a hulking hazard (it obstructs the tee shots on the par-4 17th hole), as well as something of a sprawling ’60s architectural adventure.

Those courses don’t get much ink, because golf writers visiting St. Andrews are seeking traditional linksland and the Torrance and Kittocks courses don’t quite fit the bill. Still, they’re solid designs, long and modern, with fast greens and huge prospects of the North Sea, as well as superb views over the spires and towers in town.

    "DiffbotBody": "Blockchains could cause major disruption in many industries. In media, this means an opportunity for securing micro-payments, new content programming, and rethinking the way advertising works. In the 1980s, well before Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web (the dominant “Internet” of today), a visionary tech guru named Ted Nelson came close to developing a computer network that was in many ways superior to the Web. This computer network was called Project Xanadu. In Nelson’s eyes, Berners-Lee’s Web was the antithesis of what they were trying to avoid at Xanadu. He famously said the Web “is precisely what we were trying to prevent – ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can’t follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.” If Xanadu had won, then the Web would have no failed links (“404” errors), no malware or phishing, and a working and smooth micro-payment system. But Xanadu didn’t win, and instead we have a Web with failed links, phishing, and no micro-payments. Hold that thought. We will come back to micro-payments later. The splintering of the Web Meanwhile, like Xanadu, alternate online experiences to the Web are emerging; there is the deep Web accessible via TOR and the mobile Internet of apps such as Uber or Whatsapp, which cannot be experienced on the PC. What we are seeing is a splintering of the Internet, which was synonymous with the Web, into many Internets, each with its own protocols and advantages. Each splinter from the deep Web to the mobile Web (i.e. apps) brings with it a distinct set of opportunities for media companies. Playing successfully, or even just participating, will demand a deep understanding of the medium and adapting your brand to play in that sphere. From a meta perspective, we can look at the Web as a consumption Web, aided through the HTML layer enabling easy linking to content, as contrasted with a transaction Internet. Allow me to clarify this: The Web as originally intended was not built for transactions, as you can see in the security elements tacked on (128-bit, SSL, HTTPS, etc.). When we look at the mobile Web (apps) and, more importantly, the blockchain, we see an internet built for transactions. In that sense, we can look at the newer Web as transaction Webs – built primarily for transactions and exchange than for consumption of media. Naturally, the dominant brands that have emerged for the transaction Web are transaction platforms of the likes of Uber and Airbnb. Even if we take the deep Web, the most storied brand was the online marketplace Silk Road. And, even with the blockchain, excitement really revolves around the possibility of lower-cost transactions via disintermediation, smart contracts, etc., and not around new ways of presenting or consuming content. For media brands, this isn’t very good news. The Web is terrific for sharing and consuming content. But it wasn’t built for transactions, hence the struggle media companies have had in monetising content. Devices such as the paywall are inefficient mechanisms super-imposed on a protocol layer built to enhance sharing and not drive transactions. Let us take one of these Internets or splinters – the blockchain – and understand what opportunities they present for media companies. The blockchain The blockchain is best understood as “a giant continually expanding, public ledger, that for now keeps track of who owns bitcoin. In addition the blockchain also tracks all the transactions that have occurred since inception.” Bitcoins are thus nothing but slots on the blockchain ledger. If you recall, initially excitement revolved around the bitcoin, the crypto-currency that was all set to become an alternate currency independent of any central bank’s control. Today computer scientists and thinkers are beginning to get excited instead about the bitcoin’s underlying account book, the blockchain. The brilliance of the blockchain lies in the fact that it obviates the need for a central arbiter, such as a bank to verify a transaction. Instead, many computers can participate in verifying the transaction. This has several benefits, not the least of which is the potential for reducing transaction costs considerably. Naturally the sector that is most excited about blockchains is the financial sector. It sees the high fees charged by intermediaries like banks, credit cards, and brokerage houses — essentially for verification — as an unnecessary leech on businesses worldwide. It sees the potential for disruption, and it wouldn’t be wrong. But what about the media sector? What could the blockchain hold for it? The blockchain and the media sector Broadly, we can see three possibilities: 1. Micro-payments: This is perhaps the most obvious one. One hurdle blocking the payment for content – say, for example, paying two cents for a story – is, as Marc Andreessen says, “not cost effective to run small payments (think US$1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable.” Apple got away with charging US$.099 for a song because, as a mega-volume player, it struck sweetheart deals with the payment networks. Now, thanks to bitcoin, with “its ability to go to as many as eight decimal points after the dot” you can charge customers prices below US$1. Marc Andreessen elaborates: “One reason media businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge for content is because they need to charge either all (pay the entire subscription fee for all the content) or nothing (which then results in all those terrible banner ads everywhere on the Web). “All of the sudden, with bitcoin, there is an economically viable way to charge arbitrarily small amounts of money per article, or per section, or per hour, or per video play, or per archive access, or per news alert.” (All quotations are from Marc Andreessen’s essay in The New York Times, titled Why Bitcoin Matters.) If micro-payments take off, then we can begin to see interesting possibilities. Media companies may start paying commenters for their input. Imagine a comment post that passes a certain number of up-votes receiving a tiny fee. Powerful celebrities retweeting a brand’s promotion tweets may receive a fee linked to the number of people reached. Early users of a network helping the network become attractive to new users could be rewarded, thereby encouraging newer users to join in. Some of the companies playing in this space include BitWall (which has helped Chicago Sun-Times offer a bitcoin-linked paywall), Coinbase, and Ripple Labs. 2. Programming content: The Design Agency IDEO raises the possibility of “digital-first editions” (an oxymoron in the traditional Web) in its take on the bitcoin and the new experiences that could emerge. IDEO says: “The digital world makes it dead simple to copy and spread assets (e.g., music, videos, documents). Blockchains create a secure way for creators to register origin of work, set sharing permissions, and structure the means of exchange that they’re willing to accept (payments, trade, or otherwise).” What if a writer programmes the ability for only 1,000 people to read a story, with the price for reading it increasing by one cent with each additional reader? Alternately, what if the writer of a story was willing to share a certain amount of royalty with fans who were willing to annotate and enrich the story with context, background, and trivia? Today the mechanisms to enable the above all involve significant programming effort and friction. But in the future, a content blockchain can remove friction and make consumption, paying, and revenue-sharing all happen in the background – just the way the phone co-charges us for minutes spent in conversation. There is an awful amount of complexity in how the networks settle with each other, but thankfully we don’t have to know all that. This is exactly how the content blockchain could work. 3. Re-thinking the advertisement: Historically, marketers have paid media companies to deliver audiences. What if the blockchain allowed them to bypass media companies and pay consumers to generate trials? Akin to a Kickstarter campaign but in reverse, companies or brands would pay early adopters or give them shares in the company. The brands that would do this would not be start-ups as much as large companies launching new brands or testing variants of their popular brands. If a sufficient number of companies did this, then consumers would start flocking to the companies’ Web sites, bypassing media companies entirely. For media companies dependent upon advertising revenue, the blockchain and the transaction web in general aren’t likely to bring much good news. In conclusion In many ways, what we are doing here is looking at the Internet as if it was the mid-1990s and trying to predict the emergence of Google or Facebook. In the same vein, to sit here in the early days of the blockchain and visualise the dominant companies that are likely to emerge is, in fact, next to impossible. Here, I am reminded of a wonderful quote from scientist JBS Haldane: “The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine.” On that note, I sign off. References Bitcoin and blockchains are extremely complex topics, but there are some wonderfully well-written and illuminating explanations on the Web. Coindesk, a Web site that covers bitcoin news and prices, has a page that lists the best resources to explain bitcoin (and thereby the blockchain). See its page on the best bitcoin videos, infographics, and podcasts. Dug Campbell, a Scotland-based expert on bitcoin has a bitcoin 101 section on his Web site that lists and links to a number of bitcoin and blockchain explanations. He has also written the most lucid explanation of the Byzantine General’s Problem, an old computer science problem that was considered unsolvable before bitcoin and the blockchain emerged. For a list of bitcoin/blockchain ideas and applications, see these articles by Chris Dixon, Marc Andreessen, and IDEO.

Alternately, what if the writer of a story was willing to share a certain amount of royalty with fans who were willing to annotate and enrich the story with context, background, and trivia? Today the mechanisms to enable the above all involve significant programming effort and friction. But in the future, a content blockchain can remove friction and make consumption, paying, and revenue-sharing all happen in the background – just the way the phone co-charges us for minutes spent in conversation. There is an awful amount of complexity in how the networks settle with each other, but thankfully we don’t have to know all that. This is exactly how the content blockchain could work. 3. Re-thinking the advertisement: Historically, marketers have paid media companies to deliver audiences. What if the blockchain allowed them to bypass media companies and pay consumers to generate trials? Akin to a Kickstarter campaign but in reverse, companies or brands would pay early adopters or give them shares in the company. The brands that would do this would not be start-ups as much as large companies launching new brands or testing variants of their popular brands. If a sufficient number of companies did this, then consumers would start flocking to the companies’ Web sites, bypassing media companies entirely. For media companies dependent upon advertising revenue, the blockchain and the transaction web in general aren’t likely to bring much good news. In conclusion. In many ways, what we are doing here is looking at the Internet as if it was the mid-1990s and trying to predict the emergence of Google or Facebook. In the same vein, to sit here in the early days of the blockchain and visualise the dominant companies that are likely to emerge is, in fact, next to impossible. Here, I am reminded of a wonderful quote from scientist JBS Haldane: “The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine.” On that note, I sign off. References.

I was on my way to my dream trip to Europe for a Viking River Cruise and had just passed through security. I started taking inventory of all my belongings and realized that I had left my cell phone at my office. That’s when Officer Carrigan came to the rescue. She called her supervisor, Sgt. Bellows. They then arranged for Sgt. Bellows to pick up my phone at my office and deliver it to me at the airport. Thanks to their help, my trip began on the right foot and my anxiety disappeared. Too often our law enforcement officers are defamed in the news and seldom singled out for the times when they lend valuable assistance. I felt it important to note the much-appreciated help I was given. Thank you. Glenn Seibel Bemidji",

It is hard to believe that despite all of the information around our great nation about mental health and substance use, this topic continues to be the elephant in the room. The horrific incident at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., highlights the need for targeted education. Our communities need to know what to do if they observe someone with a potential mental illness or substance use disorder. kAmx? 2=\u003e@DE 6G6CJ EC28:4 42D6 E92E :?G@=G6D 2? 24E:G6 D9@@E6C[ H6 5:D4@G6C[ 27E6C E96 724E[ E96C6 H6C6 4=F6D] !6@A=6 H9@ \u003c?6H E96 D9@@E6C D2J “E96J \u003c?6H D@\u003e6E9:?8 H2D?’E C:89E]” x?

Launceston aldermen are expected to discuss the motions at Monday’s council meeting. According to council’s report by corporate strategy manager John Davis, on the issue of compulsory local government elections – voting and replacement of postal system, it is stated that aldermen determine a view on voting, however the council is not supportive of replacement of the postal system unless it came with better technology. The council is supportive of disclosure of candidates’ political donations for amounts above a threshold, as well as mandatory elected member training. It has also left it up to aldermen on how the mayor and deputy mayor should be elected. In April past LGAT chief executive Allan Garcia made clear his opinion of the need for an overhaul of the sector on his departure after 12 years in the job and new appointee Dr Katrena Stephenson has said it would be one of the topical issues she expected to face in her time. Other motions to be raised at the upcoming association meeting include rates on commercial development in exempt areas, payment of rates on all state-owned land, responsibility for forestry and parks and wildlife roads and the Dog Control Act. Launceston aldermen are also expected to consider putting forward a candidate for president of the association, to fill the position left vacant by the death of Barry Jarvis.",

Unfortunately,Will’s movie is all but forgotten. 15. Morticia Addams in The Addams Family. Almost went to: Cher. Played by: Angelica Huston.

    "DiffbotBody": "Brace yourselves, '80s kids. You can now experience KITT, the in-car personal assistant from Knight Rider, in your own car, with this new Knight Rider-themed car charger. (Photo : ThinkGeek) The talking car from Knight Rider left an enduring impression on '80s kids. Whether they'd end up with a 20-year old jalopy or a Ferrari — they just wanted their car to be able to talk to them. While we might not have a fully-fledged Knight Industries Two Thousand, or KITTS just yet, ThinkGeek is offering the next best thing in the form of a Knight Rider-themed car charger. \"Our GPSes have gotten us closer to talking cars, but they're clearly not artificially intelligent the way KITT was. If they were, they wouldn't be driving us off of bridges under construction,\" says ThinkGeek on the product page.

    "LabBody": "By Christian de Looper, Tech Times | July 10, 4:07 PM. The talking car from Knight Rider left an enduring impression on '80s kids. Whether they'd end up with a 20-year old jalopy or a Ferrari — they just wanted their car to be able to talk to them. While we might not have a fully-fledged Knight Industries Two Thousand, or KITTS just yet, ThinkGeek is offering the next best thing in the form of a Knight Rider-themed car charger. \"Our GPSes have gotten us closer to talking cars, but they're clearly not artificially intelligent the way KITT was.

    "DiffbotBody": "Cigarette smoking is very common among people with mental illness, especially schizophrenia, a severe disorder marked by delusional thoughts and hallucinations. Sameer Jauhar, a psychiatric researcher at King’s College London, noticed the relationship. “As a psychiatrist, it’s always something you think about, because you always see patients with psychotic illnesses smoking,\" he said. \"People always generally put it down to self-medication.” Jauhar made his comments in a podcast posted by the online journal The Lancet Psychiatry, which published his study of the relationship. Findings by the King’s College team offer the intriguing notion that cigarette smoking may in some way increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. The researchers analyzed 61 studies worldwide and found the tobacco habit is three times more common among schizophrenic patients, coming to treatment for the first time, compared with the general population. Approximately one-quarter of people who live in Western countries are cigarette smokers. James MacCabe, a senior study co-author and doctor of psychiatric research at King’s College, said the fact that more than half of schizophrenics smoke is not surprising. What the finding does challenge, he said, is the belief that people who suffer from psychosis are smoking to ease their symptoms. “If the explanation was self-medication, when people started to develop schizophrenia they would be no more likely to smoke than anybody else, and then the smoking would develop in response to the symptoms,” he said. But the authors found people with schizophrenia started smoking at a younger age than other smokers, before psychotic symptoms appeared. There is a suggestion, but no findings to prove it, that nicotine stimulates production of the brain chemical dopamine. Dopamine helps control the brain's reward and pleasure centers. Increased levels have been observed in patients with psychosis, and medications to treat schizophrenia aim to reduce dopamine activity. If a definitive link is made between smoking and the development of schizophrenia, MacCabe said, patients at risk for the disorder — because of family history or substance abuse — might be well advised to kick the habit. “There are many reasons why we should try to reduce rates of smoking in population for physical health reasons,\" he said. \"But this suggests that possibly doing so would actually benefit people’s medical [mental] health.” The authors are calling for more in-depth studies investigating the role of sporadic smoking and nicotine addiction in the development of psychotic disorders.",

I would like to start by saying I have been a school custodian for more than 26 years making schools clean and safe for all staff and students. First of all, the floor strippers are of low odor and should not be able to be smelled out on the street let alone by those driving by in a vehicle. Second, the products are water soluble and actually mix with water to work. Third, it is not uncommon for flooring kept up with proper care to last for 20-plus years. I think that’s cost effective. Fourth, as far as extending the year, here’s how that works. Teachers are contracted for 10 months, most office staff are contracted for 11 months, custodians are contracted for 12 months. Yes, floors are just a part of the tried-and-true summer cleaning routine. That is also the time where light fixtures to flooring and everything in between get a hands-on cleaning.

Mechling Rohnert Park Here’s the problem Editor: I get it: The lure and seduction of wine as a current and potentially harmful phenomena. This is a beautiful place to live and thrive, to grow and to welcome visitors. Yet, there’s the significant question of excessiveness with just too much in order to withstand the impact upon water, use of pesticides and events with increased traffic. In jeopardy is the stability of local agriculture (livestock, produce, grape growers and wineries) to describe the standards of living for local purveyors. While economic development may encourage healthy lifestyles, the current answer reveals mere trends with little consideration toward maintaining a quality of life which truly stabilizes the why in the first place. Soon, the initial attractions will no longer have their attractive place in time. What’s then left is a vacancy unable to reconstruct; just too expensive and inaccessible. The “service” sector will not exist, nor then will the schools, neighborhoods, businesses, security, history, culture and diversity. The danger is an unhealthy environment. Literally. Barbara Harris Sebastopol A better solution Editor: Bill O’Reilly of Fox News is advocating Kate’s Law in response to the recent horrific circumstances resulting in Kate Steinle’s murder in San Francsico. His proposal would mandate five-year prison sentences for first-time illegal felons, 10 years for second-time offenders and 20 years for third-time offenders. This would obligate the American taxpayer to provide total housing, food, medical care and basic needs to an unconscionable increase in the already impacted prison population we have. Might a better solution be to recognize our neighbor country Mexico and direct funds and assistance that are presently going to distant countries with little appreciative benefit and recognition. If we were to partner with the leadership in Mexico, they may be able to improve their economy, incarcerate their own citizens, protect the borders and offer homeland opportunities to their citizens. Thus, the illegal immigration may become less attractive or deemed necessary and be beneficial to each of our countries. Shirley Walker Petaluma How about higher? Editor: “Raise the smoking age to 21” (Editorial, Thursday.) Even better, raise it to 80. Gary Anderson Santa Rosa Not made for this Editor: Gov. Jerry Brown’s audacious prison plan, called “realignment,” began in October 2011. Numerous reports have shown increased crime since the plan took effect. Proponents of realignment have dismissed those reports as being “too early to tell.” Thursday’s paper contained two reports on the subject of “realignment.” A story on page B3 stated that after decades of declines, Los Angeles is experiencing a 13 percent rise in crime. Page B5 showed that currently 54 percent of felons are back behind prison walls within three years compared to 67.5 percent in 2011. Is it still too early to tell? Regardless of one’s political leanings, what is clear is that county jails, which were designed to house inmates for one year or less, are now used to house felons for multiple years. Fifteen-year sentences to serve time inside a county jail is not unheard of anymore. To be sure, some money comes from the state to fund the increased burden counties incurred as a result of realignment. The rest comes from the county’s general budget. Isn’t it ironic that the response to inadequate health care in state prisons is to force counties to shoulder the burden? As Los Angeles is discovering, the costs forced upon local government are more than fiscal. Dale C. Miller Owner, Romelli Bail Bonds Santa Rosa Stand firm Editor: San Francisco must not be dissuaded from maintaining its sanctuary movement to protect undocumented immigrants from cruel and unusual treatment thru the inhumane deportation process. Granted one person, one very undesirable person, fell thru the cracks and murdered a special young woman. That occurrence was not the fault of the city and county of San Francisco. What about the murderer’s country of origin? Why did his country allow him free to leave his country? It seems that much better communication between agencies of the U.S. with the agencies of other countries needs to happen. But, San Francisco must maintain its practice of protecting undocumented immigrants. Cassandra Lista Santa Rosa 1 | 2 | 3 | 4",

    "DiffbotBody": "A few times a year, my husband goes away for a long weekend, and the kids and I are left alone for three or four days. The kids and I take advantage of these \"Dad-free\" weekends to do silly things like wear our pajamas all day long (usually my choice) or eat waffles for supper (usually the kids' choice). But one of the kids' most frequent requests is being allowed to sleep in my bed. The first time I acceded to this request, I knew right away it was a mistake. I was smart enough to really tire the kids out first - I let my daughter skip her nap, and I let her and my son swim in the pool for an hour and a half after supper - then I read them several of their favorite bedtime stories by the light of a flashlight. Finally, I tucked them into bed on either side of me with big goodnight kisses. And I thought they'd snuggle right in and drop off into peaceful slumber within minutes. Boy, was I wrong. Well, I wasn't entirely wrong. They did drop off within a few minutes, but there was absolutely nothing peaceful about it. There was thrashing. There was snorting. There was kicking. There was major blanket hogging. There was more thrashing. It was like trying to sleep inside a washing machine. So last weekend, when my husband was away again and my children begged and pleaded to sleep with me, I thought I'd be smart and I let them sleep in my room, but not in my bed. After we had all finished our evening ablutions, I sent them to their room to collect pillows, blankets and assorted stuffed animals, and I had them each pick a spot on the carpet and make themselves a cozy little nest. Much like dogs, they had to examine and sniff and test out multiple spots before they finally settled on the perfect spot - a selection which was mostly decided by my pronouncement that wherever they were by the time I finished counting to 20 was where they were staying for the night. And for the first 30 seconds or so after I turned out the lights, all was peaceful. And then my daughter announced that she needed to use the potty. So I flipped on the bathroom light and sent her on her way. Naturally, her bathroom trip inspired my son to suddenly (and desperately) need a drink of water. Which reminded my daughter that she hadn't gotten a drink of water, after which she decided she needed the potty again. This cycle continued for several minutes until I announced that bathroom breaks were over for the night unless it was a DIRE EMERGENCY. This resulted in another 30 seconds or so of peace. Which was followed by a loud fake hiccup, followed by another loud fake hiccup from the other side of the room, followed by giggling, which soon erupted into uproarious laughter. I shushed the hiccupers and listened carefully for their breathing to slow as they drifted off, but there was no drifting. What there was, however, was climbing. Two little bodies stealthily crept into my bed, worming and twisting their way under the blankets and twining themselves around my arms and legs. Which was very sweet and pleasant for a few moments, until each of them discovered that the other one was on the other side of me, and I found myself at the center of a maelstrom of sibling rivalry involving much flailing of fists and feet. Needless to say, they were immediately banned (again) from the bed. Once the sobbing had subsided to an occasional wounded sniff, I bid them goodnight (again), and drifted off to sleep myself. They, however, did not follow suit, and I was woken from my pleasant slumber mere moments later by the sound of small footsteps tiptoeing not so lightly around the room. Without opening my eyes, I barked at them to get back into their nests and the footsteps beat a hasty retreat back to their respective corners. Ah, peace once again. But alas, a short-lived peace. This time, a single set of small footsteps crept quietly from one nest to the other, followed by mutters of protest from the inhabitant of the second nest, mutters which rapidly grew to shouts. Exasperated, I ordered them back to their own beds in their own rooms, in the hope that even if they kept each other awake all night, at least I would get some rest. I probably would have, too, if they hadn't found that blasted kazoo... Sandy Philpott lives in Waltham, Mass. She can be reached at sandy@philpott.org.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Chromebooks are budget laptops that are both odd and brilliant, low-impact and potent. Running Google's Chrome OS rather than Windows, they focus on what computing has been all about since the late '90s, the web browser. With low-impact processors and barely HD screens starting at 1366 x 768 resolution, most of these machines are also designed to last. Almost every Chromebook claims between 7 and 9 hours of battery life and comes within a few hours of that range, based on our testing. If you're unclear what specs you should be on the lookout for when purchasing a Chromebook, we've developed a nifty little cheat sheet for you. Prices will start to climb above the budget range, as is the case with the new Chromebook Pixel 2 ($999, £670, AU$1,320), a laptop whose specs put it in direct competition with the new MacBook. Despite the expanding Chromebook market, there should always be something within your spending limit. At that point, it all comes down to size (and price), with Chromebooks available as small as 11.6 inches and as large as 14 inches. Always updated, here are our top-ranking Chromebook reviews: 1. Google Chromebook Pixel 2015 The end all, be all of Chromebooks. CPU: 2.2GHz Intel Core i5-5200U (dual-core, 3MB cache, up to 2.7GHz with turbo boost) | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 5500 | RAM: 8GB DDR3 | Screen: 12.85-inch 2,560 x 1,700 IPS touchscreen display | Storage: 32GB SSD | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260; Bluetooth 4.0 LE | Camera: 720p HD wide angle camera with blue glass | Weight: 3.3 pounds Dimensions: 11.7 x 8.8 x 0.6 inches (W x D x H) Outfitted with a Core i5 processor, USB 3.1 (and USB-C) ports, a high-resolution screen, and more RAM than it will ever need, the Chromebook pixel sets a high bar for Chrome OS machines for years to come. Power and performance aside, the Pixel is one of the few Chromebooks that feels like it has itself completely figured out. The build quality of this machine is exquisite and the design has been engineered down to a science. What's more, its vivid screen - plus the impeccable keyboard and trackpad - all help to round out the Pixel as one excellent, premium package. It's impossible not to get hung up on the Pixel's high price. For the same amount of money, you could buy two or even three Chromebooks or a decent Windows laptop. So before you we suggest you consider all the much more affordable options out there before investing so much money into this machine. 2. Acer Chromebook 15 C910 CPU: 2.2GHz Intel Core i5-5200 dual-core processor | Graphics: Intel HD 5500 Graphics with shared memory | RAM: 4 GB, DDR3L SDRAM | Screen: 15.6-inch full HD (1,920 x 1,080) | Storage: 32GB SSD | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi | Camera: 720p HD webcam |Weight: 4.85 pounds Dimensions: 1.0 x 15.1 x 10.1 inches (H x W x D) If you're considering the Acer Chromebook 15 C910 ($499.99, £249, AU$620) for your next laptop, then you'd better have big ideas. Compared to most other Chromebooks, the C910 has a bigger screen, bigger processing power and it comes with a bigger price tag. It takes this series of laptops to two new places, as the first with a 15.6-inch screen and the first packing a fifth-generation Broadwell processor. Specifically geared toward students and teachers – thanks to its rugged design and gorgeous visuals – the C910 is perfectly suitable for any consumer who doesn't mind lugging around a few extra pounds and inches. Read the full review: Acer Chromebook 15 C910 3. Dell Chromebook 11 (2015) Dell's updated Chromebook is a star in almost every regard CPU: 2.6GHz dual-core Intel Celeron Bay Trail-M N2840 | Graphics: Intel HD for Intel Celeron processors | RAM: 4GB RAM (DDR3L, 1,600Mhz) | Screen: 11.6-inch HD, 1366 x 768 touchscreen |Storage: 16GB SSD | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0; 802.11ac (B/G/N), dual-band Wi-Fi | Camera: 720p webcam | Weight: 2.91 pounds Dimensions: 12.6 x 8.4 x 0.76 inches Don't let the understated aesthetics of the new Dell Chromebook 11 (starting at $249, £170, AU$320) fool you. Dell packed in features that are typically reserved for more expensive business notebooks into its Chromebook 11 in an effort to create a durable product for the education market. In the Chromebook 11, you'll find a 180-degree reinforced hinge, rugged design, sealed keyboard and trackpad, and a great typing experience inside a portable package. In addition to using the Chromebook for school, students will appreciate the loud stereo speakers for multimedia and entertainment. Read the full review: Dell Chromebook 11 (2015) 4. Lenovo N20p Chromebook CPU: 1.83 GHZ Intel Celeron Processor N2930 | Graphics: Integrated Intel HD Graphics | RAM: 2GB PC3-10600 DDR3L 1333 MHz | Screen: 11.6\" HD (1366 x 768) dsplay with 10-point multitouch | Storage: 16GB eMMC storage | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: Bluetooth® 4.0, 802.11 a/c WiFi | Camera: 720p webcam | Weight: 2.86 lbs Dimensions: 11.6\" x 8.34\" x 0.70\" This is one of the \"sexier\" Chromebooks available, showcasing Lenovo's eye for style. However, the best feature is the N20p's 300-degree hinge, which lets you flip the N20p's display backward all the way into stand mode (or 'tent' mode, whatever you prefer), which lends itself nicely to viewing movies or showing presentations. The touchscreen controls also work in a pinch for recreational activities such as watching shows on HBOGo viewing or Pinteresting. Still there's some difficulty when using it as a tablet, as Chrome isn't entirely tailored to touch as a largely browser-based operating system. It's not very tuned for business use, but the Lenovo N20p offers great versatility for a leisure device. Plus with two USB ports (one 3.0), and HDMI port and an SD card reader, this Chromebook delivers a great bang for its buck. 5. Toshiba Chromebook 2 A gorgeous 1080p screen makes this Chromebook a real contender CPU: 2.16GHz Intel Celeron Processor N2840 (dual-core, 1MB Cache, up to 2.58GHz with Turbo Boost) | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics | RAM: 4 GB DDR3L | Screen: 13.3-inch, 1920 x 1090 TruBrite TFT display | Storage: 16GB SSD | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC 72608, Bluetooth 4.0 | Camera: HD webcam | Weight: 2.95 pounds Dimensions: 12.6 x 8.4 x 0.76 inches (W x D x H) For $329 (about £205, AU$382), the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a gorgeous and affordable laptop that doesn't have many weaknesses. It comes with more RAM and a full HD 1080p screen, making it a step up from other models in this class, like theSamsung Chromebook 2 and Acer C720. But potential buyers should note that the Toshiba Chromebook 2 moves the Chromebook category closer towards the territory of an affordable Windows 8.1 laptop. So you might be overpaying if you're not purchasing this laptop specifically for the Google ecosystem. That being said, the 1080p screen is a huge bonus and the laptop speakers made by Skullcandy are booming. Add it all up and the Toshiba Chromebook 2 might be an ideal streaming system for everything from YouTube and Google Play to Hulu Plus and Netflix. 6. Acer Chromebook 13 With incredible battery life, the Chromebook 13 is a winner CPU: 2.1GHz Nvidia Tegra K1 CD570M-A1 (quad-core) | Graphics: Nvidia Keplar | RAM: 2GB DDR3 (1,333MHz) | Screen: 13.3-inch, 1.920 x 1.080 | Storage: 16GB SSD | Optical drive: None | Connectivity: 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 | Camera: 720p HD webcam | Weight: 3.31 pounds Dimensions: 12.9 x 9 x 0.71 inches (W x D x H) Powered by Nvidia's ARM Cortex A15-based Tegra K1, this Chromebook packs a lot of punch in a tiny frame. Users will love its 13.3-inch 1080p resolution screen, as well as its portability. At 3.31 pounds, the Acer Chromebook 13 is a relatively light laptop. This Chromebook does have some minor issues: it doesn't multitask very well and the laptop itself only comes in one color. But for the price ($279 about £165, AU$300), you're likely to enjoy the simplicity and productivity, as you learn to overcome the design limitations. Read the full review: Acer Chromebook 13 7. HP Chromebook 11 CPU: 1.7GHz Samsung Exynos 5250 | Graphics: value | RAM: 2GB 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM |Screen: 11.6-inch diagonal HD LED-backlit IPS display (1366 x 768) | Storage: 16GB eMMC | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: 2x2 802.11a/b/g/n WLAN and Bluetooth | Camera: 720p webcam |Weight: 2.3 pounds Dimensions: 0.69 in (H) x 11.69 in (W) x 7.56 in The HP Chromebook 11 (starting at $279, £179, AU$399) is smooth and usable. While Chrome OS is limited by definition, between us growing more comfortable in web apps and those apps growing in power – and Chrome OS maturing – we're bumping into those limitations far less often. This laptop is punchy enough to make the experience slick, cheap enough for anyone on a budget (or an impulse buy for the well-off), but something that still feels solid. It is a delight to own and use. Apple and the other premium manufacturers should look at this little gem of a computer and applaud what has been achieved. The Chromebook 11 shows that it's possible to create a product with a little bit of the magic and joy you get from an Apple laptop without charging four figures for it. Read the full review: HP Chromebook 11 8. Acer C720 Chromebook CPU: 1.7 GHz Intel Core i3-4005U Dual-core | Graphics: Intel HD 4400 DDR3 SDRAM Shared | RAM:4 GB DDR3L SDRAM | Screen: 11.6\" 1,366 X 768 | Storage: 32GB | Optical drive: none |Connectivity: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0 + HS | Camera: 720p webcam | Weight: 2.76 pounds Dimensions: 0.8 x 11.3. 8.0 inches (HxWxD) In terms of power and endurance, you can't argue with the Acer C720 Chromebook (starting at $199, £199, AU$399). When you just want to get on the web quickly to answer emails or look something up, the C720 is ideal. For parents, it's also a perfect \"homework machine,\" as long as you can get a printer hooked up. This is a true web appliance, a fine system for families. The Google account log-in gives each user a personalized interface, and just a few keystrokes completely wipe the system. That limits the risk substantially in sharing the system with others. One key criterion we use in evaluating a device is whether we'd actually want to use it every day. Even taking this laptop's flaws into account, it's something we definitely would want to use, for the price. If you're an educator and buying in bulk, try the Acer C740. Read the full review: Acer C720 9. Asus Chromebook C300M CPU: 2.16 GHz Intel Bay Trail-M Dual Core Celeron N2830 Processor | Graphics: value | RAM: DDR3L 1600 MHz SDRAM, 2 GB, up to 4 GB | Screen: 13.3\" 16:9 HD (1366x768) | Storage: 32GB | Optical drive: none | Connectivity: Dual-band 802.11 b/g/n Built-in Bluetooth V4.0 | Camera: HD Web Camera | Weight: 3.08 lbs Dimensions: 13.0 x 9.1 x 0.9 inch (WxDxH) The Asus C300M ($249, £219) is a perfectly balanced device for coffee shop warriors, commuting accountants and peripatetic teachers. With more than nine hours of battery life, this 13.3-inch device will keep you going all day long. It also performed admirably on all of our benchmarks, and it even features a solid set of ports for those of you needing multiple connections. Like most other Chromebooks, this laptop isn't winning any innovation awards, but it is a good-looking, steady performer at an incredible price.",

Excessive battery life. Occasional crashes. Large screen bezels. The Asus Chromebook Flip isn't perfect, but it's an excellent little piece of kit. And for $249 (about £160, AU$337), it's so temptingly affordable that you might want to pick one up just to have a Chrome OS device on hand – even if you already own a MacBook or Windows laptop. Aside from the alluring price tag, the Flip is one of the best built Chromebooks to pave the way forward for more convertibles. Touchscreen functionality feels a bit more thought out, with a screen that actually rotates for once. All the while, the Flip meets all the core tenants of an excellent Chrome OS machine, including stellar battery life. If you've been ho hum on Chromebooks before, this is definitely one to ... flip out about. (Sorry.) Read the full review: Asus Chromebook Flip. 5. Lenovo N20p Chromebook.

But later this month, Lubbock and Gainesville will have a lot in common. Three friends will be in northwest Texas for the same reason on June 30. All will be honored by the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. “This is the Gainesville year,” said John Magnusson. Magnusson, a Florida graduate and Gainesville resident, will be given the National Collegiate Umpire Award for “a lifetime of excellence.” Rick Reichardt, who also lives in Gainesville, and former Gator coach Joe Arnold will be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Three friends. Three big-time honors. “Isn’t that something?” said Arnold. “You couldn’t have planned it any better. It’s going to be fun.” They all made it in different ways, took different paths. But they will all end up in the same place with their peers giving them ovations. Magnusson was an umpire for 30 years, mostly in the SEC and ACC. The last time he was in Lubbock, he was umpiring an NCAA Regional Tournament. “They called me and told me I was on the ballot,” he said. “I didn’t even know there was a ballot. Then they called me and told me I’m in. It’s really cool. It’s an amazing thing. “The SEC gets some negative feedback because it’s so good. There are people who think, ‘He’s an SEC umpire so he thinks he’s all that.’ So for them to honor me like this is exciting and it’s really exciting to be going there with Joe and Rick.” Magnusson graduated from Florida in 1972 and coached at P.K. Yonge with legendary baseball coach Bob Hawkins. One day, Magnusson was complaining about umpires at a game. “You think you can do better?” Hawkins asked him. “Yeah, I do,” Magnusson replied. “Prove it,” Hawkins said. That was the beginning of a long career for Magnusson. “Once I started to get some training, I found out how little I knew,” he said. Magnusson was a fixture umpiring Florida games for much of his career and was good enough to have umpired at three College World Series, plus some Division II and junior college championships. “Mag is one of the all-time great umpires,” Arnold said. “I’m going to say that (at the induction ceremony) and that, yes, he did throw me out of several games.” Arnold was Florida’s baseball coach from 1984-94 after seven stellar years at Florida Southern. He was the first UF coach to take a Gator team to the College World Series in 1988 and returned in ’91. Arnold won 434 games at Florida. But it is not as a coach that he earned the Hall of Fame. “I’m going in as a small college player,” he said. Arnold, who is retired and living in Lakeland, still holds the record for most innings pitched in a national junior college tournament. He threw 31 innings in the 1967 tourney for Miami Dade Community College. “I was the closer, the set-up man and the starter,” he said. “We only had 13 players so I played some shortstop, too. “What an honor. I’m thrilled. When I got the call, I just said, ‘Holy cow.’ ” Reichardt is going into the Hall because of his career as a player at the University of Wisconsin. He twice led the Big Ten in batting and was also a fullback for the Badgers’ football team. “I was excited when I heard, but I wasn’t sure of the organization,” he said. “I asked a few people including (former Texas Tech basketball coach) Bobby Knight and they all had good things to say. “It’s just a shame there won’t be anyone from Wisconsin there to present me. (Wisconsin dropped baseball in 1991). I think them not having a program might have been a deterrent (for his induction). But I’m very honored.” It’s a bittersweet honor for Reichardt, who lost his mother Bernice last week at the age of 96. “She knew about it,” he said. “I think she was proud of her oldest son.” Reichardt also had an 11-year major league career and signed for what was considered a groundbreaking amount of $200,000 by the Los Angeles Angels in 1964. The bidding war led to the implementation of the MLB draft. He moved to Gainesville in 1980 and served as a volunteer coach at both Florida and Santa Fe. Reichardt has a batting cage and pitching machine is in his yard where he’s always willing to help young hitters with the finer points of the game. Reichardt and Arnold and Magnusson have been in touch about their special night. Reichardt and Magnusson often sit together at McKethan Stadium to watch Florida baseball games. In a little more than a week, the three friends will sit together in Lubbock, letting the applause wash over them for jobs well done. Contact Pat Dooley at 352-374-5053 or at dooleyp@gvillesun.com.

    "DiffbotBody": "Miniature golf is one of the most fun and versatile summer pastimes. It can be played outdoors, at night, indoors in the dark, or even on a giant recreation of Noah’s Ark. For more on that last one, you’ll have to read through our guide to the greatest mini-golf courses in America… Mayday Golf, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: The best mini-golf courses mix a fun theme with creative course construction. Oh, and having a crashed plane sticking out of a waterfall doesn’t hurt. Choose from Mayday Mountain—18 holes that wind around a mountain and underneath the downed plane—and Rescue Falls, which ends with a model helicopter coming to your rescue. Relax: There’s no smoke monster. Old Pro Golf 68th Street, Ocean City, Maryland: The venerable Old Pro chain of mini-golf courses are beloved by multiple generations of Ocean City beachgoers. And the 68th Street location is the closest you’ll get to swinging clubs in Jurassic Park. The course offers a healthy variety of holes with obstacles ranging from pesky prehistoric lizards to an angry club-wielding caveman. Par-King Skill Golf, Lincolnshire, Illinois: Dating back to the 1950s, Par-King has been dubbed “Mini-Golf’s Taj Mahal.” It’s definitely one of the strangest courses out there, with holes featuring everything from spaceships to castles to a mini Mount Rushmore. Additional obstacles like clowns, merry-go-rounds, and a Sears Tower replica only add to the course’s surreal Americana vibe. Smuggler’s Cove Adventure Golf, various Florida locations: Many golf courses boast pirate themes, but only one offers real reptiles! Every Smuggler’s Cove location features live gators you can feed (if you dare) with bamboo fishing poles. Just be careful where you whack your ball—if the gators get it, not even Chubbs Peterson can retrieve it for you. Glowing Greens, Portland and Beaverton, Oregon: Ever wanted to play mini-golf inside a gonzo black light painting? That’s the experience you’ll get at Oregon’s indoor Glowing Greens courses. Playing in the dark might seem weird, but you’ll get used to it once you pop on your 3D glasses and experience animated skeletons, aliens and other obstacles. Trippy, dude. Lexington Ice Center, Lexington, Kentucky: The Travel Channel raved about the greens at this ice skating/family fun center. It’s definitely the only mini-golf course where you can play on models of Mount Sinai and Noah’s Ark. Yes, there’s a Biblical theme, with courses based on the Old Testament, New Testament and “Miracles.” Have fun, but be sure to heed the first Commandment: “If thy ball should land in a water hazard, thou must taketh a penalty stroke.” Molten Mountain, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: The main attraction at Molten Mountain golf is the titular 50-foot man-made volcano that actually erupts and spews forth pink “lava.” Sure the lava looks a bit like Pepto-Bismol. But you’ll be too distracted by two mini-golf courses—one inside the mountain and one out—to ponder how exactly they get the water to turn that color. KISS Monster Mini-Golf, Las Vegas: Leave it to the legendary rockers to deliver the most extreme (and bizarre) mini-golf course of all time. In addition to 18 holes of rock-’n’-roll-themed madness, the venue boasts scarily accurate animatronic versions of the band, the world’s largest KISS memorabilia store and a wedding chapel. It is Vegas, after all. Lumberjack Pass Miniature Golf, Lake George, New York: Set against the breathtaking Adirondack Mountains, this bucolic gem spreads its 18 holes over an acre of land with plenty of actual flowing waterfalls and treacherous sand traps. They also supply ball washers to clean your balls. For when they get caught in a sand trap, of course. Space Golf, Orland Park, Illinois: Golfers and sci-fi fans alike flock to this indoor golf mecca. Models of Darth Vader, Yoda and Borg Captain Picard greet players as they enter a course filled with spaceships, aliens and more galactic wonders. It’s the closest you’ll get to a Star Wars-themed golf course in this galaxy. Just don’t argue over who gets to shoot first—the answer is always Han Solo.",

Joseph Pitts said, \"Today's ruling will lead to grave infringements of religious freedom across the United States\" (\"Public officials, leaders of advocacy groups react,\" Reading Eagle, June 27). I fail to see how my religious freedom is being compromised or affected by the marriage of a gay couple. Pitts is aware that the marriage ceremony need not be conducted by a member of the clergy, hence no clergy is forced to marry a gay couple, although many are willing to do so. Some will say that gay marriage violates the tradition of marriage. Well it was not too long ago that it was traditional for Italians to marry Italians, Jews to marry Jews and whites to marry whites. That tradition has been altered. I get annoyed when people wish to introduce their religious beliefs into the discussion of this matter of gay marriage. Quoting the Bible doesn't work for me. It is foolish to base one's view of life on ideas that, however plausible at the time 2,000 to 4,000 years ago, now appear to be quite erroneous. And what would be more important than to find our true place in the universe by removing one by one these unfortunate vestiges of earlier beliefs?

    "DiffbotBody": "Managing type 2 diabetes is difficult for many. Researchers are saying, though, that bariatric surgery may produce better results than simple lifestyle management when it comes to addressing diabetes. (Photo : Victor Casale | Flickr) Lifestyle management has always been recommended to achieve lasting improvement to health. A new study, however, has shown that bariatric surgery trumps lifestyle changes when it comes to addressing type 2 diabetes. Published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the study found that people with type 2 diabetes who undergo bariatric surgery are likelier to experience significant improvements in their diabetes within three years compared to those who manage the condition using lifestyle changes. \"One of the most important things to take away is that there is durability of remission over time,\" stated Dr. Anita Courcoulas from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the research lead for the study. Previous studies have shown that weight loss surgery has the potential to improve the condition of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but they have not been able to establish if the procedure are better on the overall than lifestyle changes when it comes to treating the condition. Not to mention that few studies actually focused on examining how effective weight loss surgery can be for people with diabetes and class 1 or 2 obesity. Class 1 and 2 obesity are defined as having body mass indexes from 30 to 39. However, weight loss surgeries are only typically advised for people with BMI levels of at least 40. Procedures are only usually recommended for those with lower BMI levels if other health conditions are in the picture. Courcoulas and colleagues worked with 61 individuals between the ages of 25 and 55. All have type 2 diabetes, with around half categorized as having class 1 obesity. All the subjects were randomly assigned to receive: lifestyle intervention for a year; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery; or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. After all of these initial treatments, lower-intensity lifestyle intervention offering behavioral counseling a few times each month for two years were provided for all. After three years, results showed that 40 percent of those who got Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and 29 percent of those who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding had some level of remission from type 2 diabetes. None of those from the non-surgical group exhibited remission from their diabetes. Additionally, three participants from the Roux-en-Y group and one from the gastric banding group completely got rid of their diabetes. Again, none from the non-surgical group was able to achieve this. Researchers also saw that blood sugar control has drastically improved in the surgical groups to the point that that subjects who received Roux-en-Y and gastric banding surgery are likely to not need medication to manage their diabetes. The researchers are pleased with the results but are keen on doing more work to draw definite conclusions, pooling data from similar studies from across the United States. Aside from Courcoulas, Steven Belle, John Jakicic, Rebecca Neiberg, Wei Lang, James DeLany, Sheila Pierson, Melissa Kalarchian and Jessie Eagleton also contributed to the study.

Previous studies have shown that weight loss surgery has the potential to improve the condition of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but they have not been able to establish if the procedure are better on the overall than lifestyle changes when it comes to treating the condition. Not to mention that few studies actually focused on examining how effective weight loss surgery can be for people with diabetes and class 1 or 2 obesity. Class 1 and 2 obesity are defined as having body mass indexes from 30 to 39. However, weight loss surgeries are only typically advised for people with BMI levels of at least 40. Procedures are only usually recommended for those with lower BMI levels if other health conditions are in the picture. Courcoulas and colleagues worked with 61 individuals between the ages of 25 and 55. All have type 2 diabetes, with around half categorized as having class 1 obesity. All the subjects were randomly assigned to receive: lifestyle intervention for a year; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery; or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. After all of these initial treatments, lower-intensity lifestyle intervention offering behavioral counseling a few times each month for two years were provided for all. After three years, results showed that 40 percent of those who got Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and 29 percent of those who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding had some level of remission from type 2 diabetes. None of those from the non-surgical group exhibited remission from their diabetes. Additionally, three participants from the Roux-en-Y group and one from the gastric banding group completely got rid of their diabetes. Again, none from the non-surgical group was able to achieve this. Researchers also saw that blood sugar control has drastically improved in the surgical groups to the point that that subjects who received Roux-en-Y and gastric banding surgery are likely to not need medication to manage their diabetes. The researchers are pleased with the results but are keen on doing more work to draw definite conclusions, pooling data from similar studies from across the United States. Aside from Courcoulas, Steven Belle, John Jakicic, Rebecca Neiberg, Wei Lang, James DeLany, Sheila Pierson, Melissa Kalarchian and Jessie Eagleton also contributed to the study.

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

    "LabBody": "Vivek MV, Bengaluru, July 11, 2015, DHNS: New Zealand look to bounce back. After clinching the five-match ODI series 3-2, a confident-looking Indian women’s team will take on New Zealand in the first of the three T20 Internationals here at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.The hosts have the momentum on their side after scripting a great comeback when the chips were down in the one-dayers. In their previous T20I outing in Bengaluru, India had snatched a 16-run victory against South Africa in November last year. Indian spinners, barring one bad game, succeeded to trouble the New Zealand batting with some tight and economical bowling performance. In the pace department, Jhulan Goswami, the women’s No 1 ranked bowler in the world, has done well so far by not being expensive early on in the innings.However, Indian batters will face a challenging task to score at a brisk pace against a competitive New Zealand bowling attack. The hosts will bank on the dashing left-handed opener Smriti Mandhana and skipper Mithali Raj to come good for them with their explosive batting.In their biggest assignment last year, the 2014 Women’s World T20 held in Bangladesh, India had crashed out in the group stage, with two wins and two defeats. The White Ferns boast of some big hitters in their line-up and skipper Suzie Bates felt that her side must dismiss their tentative approach that hurt them badly in the ODIs. “I think we have a very strong T20 side. All-rounders such as Sophie Devine and Anna Peterson can clear the boundaries with ease. But I am a bit disappointed with how the batswomen have played the Indian spinners. We were very tentative in our approach and things didn’t work for us. It is all about backing ourselves,” said Bates. Bates stressed that this T20I series is an important step towards their preparation for the Women’s World T20, scheduled in India next year. “The series is massive for us. We want to get more familiar with the conditions since we know we will play the World T20 in India next year. The team is looking forward to putting up an improved show,” she said.",

What’s left is a town of abandoned houses and tons of ghost stories. 2. Leap Castle, Ireland This is rumoured to be one of the most haunted places in the world. During a renovation workers found a hidden dungeon containing three cartloads of human remains. 3. Cincinnati Subway System, Ohio. Cincinnati was a bustling city at the turn of the century, so a subway system was built to cope with the city’s logistical demands. The project ran out of money and the tunnels were built, but nothing was put in them. 4. Island of the Dolls, Mexico. Outside Mexico City is a series of canals and artificial islands, and one is full of old dolls and doll parts collected by a man for a girl who died in one of the canals. Spooky. 5. Villisca Ax Murder House, Iowa. 6. The Overtoun Bridge, Scotland. This bridge has been the site of about 600 human suicides since its construction – but that isn’t the weirdest part. Every year, around 15 dogs jump to their death, the only known example of dog suicide. 7. Abandoned Laboratory, Russia Explorers in Moscow found an abandoned Soviet lab, filled with preserved brains and other Cold War-era relics. 8. Candido Godoi, Brazil. This Brazilian town has a birthrate of twins that’s 18 times higher than the rest of the world! Locals say that the phenomenon only started when twin-obsessed Nazi doctor Josef Mengele fled there after the war. 9. British Sea Forts, North Sea These forts were built to protect the North Sea during WWII. Now, they’re abandoned, slowly rotting. 10. The Domes, Arizona No one knows how these domes got out to the Arizona desert, but they just sit there, decaying. 11. Scott’s Hut, Antartica. Scott and his team set out from here in their race to get to the South Pole. Unfortunately, they were beaten there, and they died on the way back. Because of the cold, everything in the hut is perfectly preserved. 12. Chernobyl Amusement Park, Ukraine The amusement park was set to open on May 1st, 1986, 5 days after the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl. 13. Beelitz Military Hospital, Germany Adolf Hitler was treated in this hospital during WWI. It survived WWII, but now sits abandoned. 14. Bird Suicide Grounds of Jatinga, India Every year in September and October hundreds of birds flock to Jatinga, between 7 and 10pm, and dive to their deaths. 15. Griffith Park Zoo, Los Angeles Instead of getting rid of this old zoo, the Los Angeles government decided to abandon it, but left the site open to the public. Creepy. 16. Muynak, Uzbekistan The water to this lake was diverted by the Soviets, and now it’s a ship graveyard. 17. Aokigahara Forest, Japan This dense forest at the base of Mt. Fuji is a place where a lot of people commit suicide in Japan. The problem is so serious that the government posts signs throughout the woods urging people to reconsider. 18.

The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, has expelled 73 students for under-performance as they failed to secure the minimal Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 5 in the first year of their BTech programme.As expulsion of such a large number of students in one go created a flutter, the hands of the Human Resource Development Ministry remained tied as the parents of these students had undertaken at the time of their admission that their wards' poor performance could lead to their removal from the institute. “The number of students expelled by IIT-Roorkee on Wednesday may be a bit higher, but this not a new thing. Students are shown doors at most of the IITs for under-performance. This is the rule. The ministry can not interfere in such issues,” said official sources.After their expulsion, many of the students have pleaded for “mercy”. IIT-Roorkee will decide on their prayers “as it deems fit”, said sources. The institute’s action, however, brought in the open a deeper problem IITs face in terms of getting quality students. Many IIT professors suggested that the change in the question pattern of entrance examinations brought almost a decade ago should be blamed for the situation.“Earlier, IIT aspirants had to answer descriptive questions in the entrance test. This actually helped IITs select meritorious students,” an IIT-Delhi professor told Deccan Herald.DH News Service.",

    "DiffbotBody": "On Wednesday, the hosts of The Cycle on MSNBC mocked Republican alternatives to ObamaCare. When Toure read a quote from Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) saying he wants to replace the ACA with a more patient-centric plan, Josh Barro of the New York Times wondered: “What does that mean?” And added that “it can mean whatever the listener wants it to mean.” Toure and Kystal Ball sarcastically threw out words to dismiss Republican arguments against ObamaCare. Ball shouted, “patient centric!...cheaper!...flexible!” By Connor Williams | June 26, 2015 | 1:43 PM EDT The cheerleading for the president by MSNBC following the Supreme Court’s decision to affirm the federal subsidies in ObamaCare has been virtually ubiquitous. On the June 26 edition of Morning Joe, Eugene Robinson, Al Sharpton, and Mika Brzezinski were all jubilant about the high court’s decision, arguing that it will help to affirm the legacy of President Obama. By Curtis Houck | June 25, 2015 | 11:23 PM EDT Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling in favor of President Obama in the ObamaCare subsidy case, the “big three” of ABC, CBS, and NBC were out in full force during their Thursday evening newscasts to cheer the “historic ruling” and labeled Chief Justice John Roberts as a “conservative” after having “saved” ObamaCare “from a devastating blow.” CBS anchor Scott Pelley assured viewers in an opening tease that “[m]illions of Americans will keep their health insurance as the Supreme Court today saves the President's signature law.” By Curtis Houck | June 25, 2015 | 9:30 PM EDT Touting how “over ten million people have now signed up for health insurance under the ObamaCare law,” NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt on Thursday night trumpeted “the ObamaCare law now directly effecting so many families who say it’s been quite literally a lifesaver.” Chris Jansing delivered heartwarming anecdotes about people who have benefitted and only, at the very end of her report, did she squeeze in a brief mention of how some have been hurt. By Matthew Balan | June 25, 2015 | 12:39 PM EDT Thursday's CNN Newsroom hyped the Supreme Court's decision that again upheld ObamaCare as a \"huge win for the President of the United States,\" as Wolf Blitzer put it. Gloria Borger and John King tied the Court decision to Congress passing the President's fast-track trade legislation earlier in the week. Borger trumpeted, \"You have trade legislation being approved – huge win for the President. You have this reaffirmation of ObamaCare...huge for his legacy.\" King added, \"This may well be the best week of his second term.\" By Jeffrey Meyer | June 25, 2015 | 11:58 AM EDT Following the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision in favor of ObamaCare on Thursday, ABC News quickly touted the victory for the Obama administration with correspondent Terry Moran declaring “ObamaCare 2, conservatives 0 is the score right now.” The ABC reporter went on, in the 10 AM EDT hour special, to hype how \"once again its Chief Justice John Roberts crushing the hopes of conservatives, upholding a key section of the ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act.” By Curtis Houck | June 23, 2015 | 12:23 AM EDT The top English and Spanish-language broadcast networks again ignored on Monday night a new development in the Jonathan Gruber saga as new e-mails have surfaced that revealed how his role with the White House on ObamaCare was more detailed than previously thought. As initially reported by The Wall Street Journal, e-mails “show frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on the Affordable Care Act.” By Curtis Houck | June 16, 2015 | 9:13 PM EDT The top English and Spanish networks refused on Tuesday evening to cover the findings of a federal audit report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) that concluded that just under $3 billion in ObamaCare subsidies have been unable to be properly verified that, according to the audit, puts taxpayer funding “at risk.” While the broadcast networks ignored this story, the FNC's Special Report devoted a one-minute-and-48-second segment to the IG’s findings. By Randy Hall | June 12, 2015 | 5:10 PM EDT As Barack Obama demonstrated on Thursday, one of the best ways to ensure an interview full of “softball” questions is to bring in someone who has benefited from your policies and is happy to say so. After Jerry Penacoli and the president exchanged greetings, the Extra correspondent stated: “Thank you for inviting us. I know this is rare to have an interview sitting down with you here in the Rose Garden. It doesn't happen very often.” “It is my pleasure,” Obama stated. By Curtis Houck | June 8, 2015 | 11:20 PM EDT The “big three” of ABC, CBS, and NBC all refused to mention on Monday night comments made by President Barack Obama earlier in the day in which he attacked the Supreme Court for taking a case regarding ObamaCare subsidies and warned them not to rule that they’re unconstitutional. They remained on the sidelines as FNC's Special Report with Bret Baier worked to once again fill the void with not only a full segment, but also a discussion of it with the show’s “All-Star Panel.” The liberal website Huffington Post, that once advised readers on how to avoid talking about Obamacare during Thanksgiving dinner, surprisingly confronted a serious problem for the Affordable Care Act recently. On June 1, HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps and Huffington Posts’ senior national correspondent Jonathan Cohn about the unaffordability of Obamacare. In the segment, \"What If The Affordable Care Act Isn't Affordable?\" Cohn admitted that \"rate increases look higher\" for 2016 than in previous years, based on proposals that insurers were required to submit to the government by June 1. Companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico reportedly want to increase their premiums by as much as 50 percent. By Joseph Rossell | April 9, 2015 | 10:09 AM EDT Surprise! Millions of uninsured Americans could owe Uncle Sam extra this tax season because of Obamacare. The IRS began penalizing tax filers this year if they failed to purchase insurance in 2014. Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), included an insurance mandate. Americans must buy qualified health insurance or face the larger of two tax penalty options when they file their 2014 taxes: $95 per adult and $47.50 per child up to $285 per family, or 1 percent of income up to $9,800, according to Kaiser Health News. These penalties are also scheduled to increase dramatically in the following years. By Joseph Rossell | February 18, 2015 | 11:54 AM EST Obamacare has increased the tax burden on taxpayers and companies, a fact ignored in recent broadcast news reports. Obamacare created or hiked at least 13 taxes, Forbes reported February 17. Forbes contributor and tax lawyer Robert Wood said that for the average American, “it’s easy to be overwhelmed” by all the new taxes and forms that come with Obamacare. By Joseph Rossell | January 21, 2015 | 2:10 PM EST During his State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama said he wanted to “simplify” the tax paperwork required for small businesses, but CNBC’s Jim Cramer pointed out that Obamacare is doing just the opposite. Obama had said during his State of the Union speech on Jan. 20, that a small business owner should be able to file taxes “based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford.” However, Cramer, co-anchor of CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” said on Jan. 21, that Obama’s very own health insurance initiative had already increased, rather than decreased, the complexity of tax accounting for small businesses. By Joseph Rossell | January 6, 2015 | 12:08 PM EST The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, started creating even more headaches for both employers and employees across the country beginning Jan. 1, 2015. That was the day Obamacare’s employer mandate went into effect, requiring companies with 100 or more workers to provide health insurance to at least 70 percent of their employees. Mandates for smaller businesses will be introduced in 2016 in addition to increased mandates for larger companies, according to The Washington Post. By Joseph Rossell | December 5, 2014 | 10:56 AM EST New and expensive federal regulations stemming from Obamacare that will require many restaurants publish calorie counts probably won’t have much impact on patrons’ food choices, experts told The Huffington Post. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on November 25 that “chain restaurants, similar retail food establishments and vending machines with 20 or more locations” must post calorie counts on their menus or menu boards. The new rules were required by a provision in the Affordable Care Act. By Curtis Houck | November 12, 2014 | 6:24 PM EST During a discussion on MSNBC’s The Cycle about the disparaging comments ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber made about the law’s passage and the “stupidity” of voters, New York Times writer and substitute Cycle co-host Josh Barro sought to defend him by blasting the expectations that Americans have about health care as “completely incoherent” and lying was the only solution to make them happy. Barro told fellow panelists and guest Lauren Fox of National Journal that “what drives me crazy about this story” was that: “Jonathan Gruber was right. Public opinion on health care policy is just completely incoherent.” By Randy Hall | November 12, 2014 | 6:10 PM EST This week has been a busy time for conservative icon Glenn Beck. During his Monday program, Beck admitted to his audience at TheBlaze.com that he had been suffering from a rare neurological disease for five years, but after undergoing hormone therapy, electric stimulation and other treatments -- not to mention relying on his faith in God -- the disease has been reversed, and he's on his way to an almost total recovery. Then on Tuesday, MSNBC's Ed Schultz stated that Beck had “access and opportunity” to get the best treatment possible and declared: “I hope that his story motivates those who think that ObamaCare is bad, that maybe they will rethink” their opposition to the Affordable Care Act. By Tom Johnson | August 28, 2014 | 5:17 PM EDT The Trotskyist-turned-conservative writer James Burnham said that where there’s no solution, there’s no problem. In a Thursday post, American Prospect blogger Paul Waldman analyzed what he considers one such situation: the Republican party’s ongoing shortfall with female voters. Waldman doesn’t see how the GOP can overcome both its ideas and its tone on women’s issues. He asserted that when Republicans discuss their opposition to abortion and the contraceptive mandate, many of them “can't keep themselves from doing so in the most hostile, contemptuous ways imaginable.” By Tom Johnson | July 29, 2014 | 10:29 PM EDT According to Daily Kos writer Dante Atkins, the D.C. Circuit’s Halbig decision resembled a plot twist in a movie in which “evil” conservatives know they’ve lost the Obamacare battle but “refuse to go quietly and seek to cause as much destruction as [they] can on [their] certain path to oblivion.” Atkins wrote in a Sunday post that two factors made the court’s ruling possible: “imprecise language by the authors of the Affordable Care Act” and the “destructive psychopathy of the right wing.” By Tom Johnson | July 25, 2014 | 6:56 PM EDT What do Lee Atwater, Karl Rove, and Vladimir Lenin have in common? If you answered that they’re all Republican strategists, you’re sort of right, suggested Seth D. Michaels in a Thursday article at Talking Points Memo. Michaels claimed that GOPers are using a Leninist approach to subvert an increased government role in the health-care system. (Oh, the irony.) Specifically, they’ve taken “deliberate action to make the bad [Obamacare] outcomes they fervently wished for more likely…There’s a name for this strategy, [which] comes from Soviet Communism: ‘heighten the contradictions.’” By Tom Johnson | July 23, 2014 | 10:22 PM EDT What did conservative leaders and activists feel when they learned of the D.C. Circuit Court decision on Obamacare subsidies? Happiness? Relief? American Prospect blogger Paul Waldman seemed to have another word in mind: schadenfreude -- “satisfaction or pleasure felt at someone else's misfortune.” In a Tuesday post, Waldman opined that, sure, righties were “excited” that the ruling was a setback for President Obama and the ACA, but “what actually had them so pleased is the possibility that millions of Americans will lose their health insurance.” Republicans, he added, “will gladly crush the lives of ordinary people if it means gaining some momentary partisan advantage.”",
    "LabBody": "Morning Joe Panel: Kasich's Debate Performance 'Reaganesque', Medicaid Answer 'Best of the Entire Night' By Connor Williams | August 7, 2015 | 11:28 AM EDT. Following Thursday night’s explosive Republican primary debate on Fox News, MSNBC’s Morning Joe was in Cleveland for reaction. A panel heaped praise on Ohio governor John Kasich, particularly regarding his response to a question about Medicaid expansion. Willie Geist described it as “the best answer of the entire night that any candidate gave.” Host Joe Scarborough thought he “hit it out of the park.” John Heilemann cheered Kasich’s general performance as “Reaganesque in some ways.”",

For the latest news and views on gas, coal, electricity and more, check out On the Grid today. 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Saturday, July 11, 2015, 12:01 a.m. WASHINGTON — Parents may hesitate to hand teens the keys to the family car, but Congress is proposing to allow drivers as young as 18 to get behind the wheel of big rigs on the nation's interstates. Federal regulations require drivers be at least 21 before they can drive commercial trucks across state lines, but a bill introduced this week by Republican senators would allow contiguous states that join together in “compacts” to drop the age threshold to 18 for interstate trips. There is no limit on the number of states that could join the compacts. After four years, the Transportation secretary is supposed to report to Congress on whether teens have “an equivalent level of safety” in comparison with older truckers. In 2013, all drivers ages 18-20 had a fatal crash involvement rate, per 100,000 licensed drivers, that was 66 percent higher than drivers who were age 21 years or older, according to the Transportation Department's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, although the total number of crash deaths among teens has been declining since 2002. The change was sought by the trucking industry to help address a shortage of truck drivers. The American Trucking Association estimates that the current shortage of drivers is roughly 35,000 to 40,000, but because of retirements and individuals leaving the industry, trucking companies will need to recruit nearly 100,000 new drivers a year over the next decade to keep pace with the country's freight needs. But Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said allowing teens to drive trucks weighing as much as 80,000 pounds and to work as many as 82 hours a week, as is permitted in the truck industry, is a “catastrophe waiting to happen.” “The combination of inexperience, high-risk driving and large trucks can cause unbelievable devastation,” she said. Dave Osiecki, chief of advocacy for trucking associations, said states already allow teens to drive commercial trucks unlimited miles within their borders. For example, it makes no sense to allow a teen truck driver to drive hundreds of miles from one end to the other of a state like Virginia, but prohibit the same driver from crossing the Potomac River into Washington, he said. “We absolutely support” lowering the age limit, he said. “It would be good for our industry, it would be good for commerce, it would be good for the economy.” Legislation to allow states to lower the age for a commercial, interstate license to 18 was first introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and was incorporated into a larger transportation bill introduced this week by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Fischer. The bill would restrict teen truckers from hauling hazardous materials or operating “special configurations,” which are generally defined as oversized or overweight loads. States and the U.S. Department of Transportation would also be allowed to impose other restrictions if they wish. States wouldn't be obligated to join the compacts, but Gillan said she expects state officials would be under pressure from the trucking industry to do so. To obtain an interstate commercial driver's license, drivers must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test administered by a state motor vehicles department. But there is no requirement that drivers first receive on the road training or attend a training school, Gillan said. Labor unions have said the driver shortage could be eliminated by raising truckers' wages and improving working conditions. A decade ago the Bush administration looked at lowering the commercial truck driving age to 18, but ultimately decided against doing that because the public comments the government received were overwhelmingly against the idea.

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project. At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited.

Or perhaps you’ve only heard about him, or read about him in Rolling Stone a few years back. He’s larger than life – a superhero Orlando can call its own. Master Legend, who grew up in New Orleans, says he started on the path to superhero in second grade, when he learned to fight off bullies. “I was a badly abused and starved kid,” he says. “Most of the kids did not like me, and I only fit in with fellow abused kids that got it at school and at home.” One day, he says, he came across some comics in a trashcan, and though he says he couldn’t read all the words, he realized that becoming a superhero was his calling. “I made myself a mask and a shirt with an emblem on it, and the superhero was born,” he says. “I finally felt alive. I felt like I had a purpose, and it was to help others.” And that’s exactly what Master Legend does. He was commended in 2004 by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office for assisting people in need during the aftermath of Hurricane Charley, and today he spends a lot of his time (when he’s not working at his mild-mannered day job) giving away food, toiletries and other necessities to homeless individuals and “tearing down the walls of greed.” When asked what the best thing about being a superhero is, Master Legend simply says: “I get to be me.” When asked to tell us what he thinks is the best thing about Orlando, he says: “The real, honest, hardworking people out there.

Nightmare is another word for “bad dream.” It’s a type of sleep disturbance characterized by frightening dreams in which your child feels threatened and develops a sense of physical danger. An example would be dreaming of being chased by a stranger or monster.

    "DiffbotBody": "It has been a wild afternoon in the NHL as the Bruins picked up the 13th pick for Milan Lucic after they earlier traded Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for the 15th pick as well as a couple of second round selections. They owned the 14th pick heading into the draft and the rumor is that they are interested in defenseman Noah Hanifan and could trade up with their multiple picks. Earlier, the Senators dealt goaltender Robin Lehner and forward David Legwand to Buffalo for the 21st overall selection. Expect a lot more trading to go on in the first round. Don’t forget, for everything NHL, check out Rotoworld's Player News, and follow @Rotoworld_ HK and @mfinewaxhockey on Twitter. 1. Edmonton Oilers - Connor McDavid (C) Erie Connor McDavid is a once-in-a-generational talent who blends together the best skills of Hockey Hall of Famers at warp speed. He is blessed a 6’1, 190-pound frame, great character and an awesome array of moves that produced 169 points in just 67 games through the OHL regular season and playoffs. He is the catalyst for positive plays on every inch of the ice due to lightning-quick decision-making, a powerful stride, brilliant puck skills and his intuitive ability to find the open man or take his shot — no matter the quality or quantity of the defense he is facing. The Newmarket, Ontario-native appears to have the capacity to produce at over a point-per-game pace as a rookie and put together the type of career that ranks amongst the best of all time. His star power to the sport compares to what LeBron James brought to the NBA in 2003 and Andrew Luck brought to the NFL in 2012. 2. Buffalo Sabres - Jack Eichel (C) Boston University Jack Eichel is the best consolation prize since the Pittsburgh Penguins snagged Evgeni Malkin second overall in the 2004 NHL Draft after Alex Ovechkin. The Chelmsford, Massachusetts-native has the size, speed and skill to single-handedly take the game up a notch every time he steps onto the ice. Coming off the most dominating NCAA season for a freshman since Paul Kariya in 1993, Eichel led Boston University to a conference title, led the nation in scoring with 71 points in 40 games and earned the Hobey Baker Award as the league’s best player. Highlighting Eichel’s deep collection of skills are his superior hockey IQ, his heavy shot, relentless work ethic and capable defensive prowess. The 18-year-old comes with all the trimmings of a franchise center and it's highly likely that we'll see him in the NHL next year. 3. Arizona Coyotes - Dylan Strome (C) Erie Otters Strome was the OHL’s leading scorer (129 points in 68 games) and boasts a robust 6’3, 187-pound frame that has number-one NHL center potential written all over it. Strome thrives with the puck in open-ice and can find his teammates with his 360-degree vision, or finish off the play with his quick, accurate shot. While Connor McDavid was sidelined, Strome had a golden opportunity to prove he was not the byproduct of the projected superstar’s brilliance in Erie, and succeeded with 18 goals and 35 points in 21 games. Strome’s points-per-game dipped from two to 1.67 without McDavid, although for the most part the duo only played together on the power play anyways. Strome’s acceleration is a work in progress, as are his defensive game and physicality. Although there is room for fine-tuning, the Missiauga, Ontario-native’s strength, puckhandling skills and creativity have spurred comparisons to some of the best centers in the game. 4. Toronto Maple Leafs - Mitchell Marner (C) London Knights Marner stands out as an impact player in all three zones of the rink — and it’s not because of his frame. At 5’11, 163-pounds, Marner is a lightweight with a heavy dose of electrifying offensive talent that belongs in the top-five of any draft class, including this year’s special crop. With 123 points in 63 games for the London Knights this year, Marner proved to be a tremendously talented force with elite speed, vision, hockey sense, a finishing touch and the ability to make people around him better. He overcomes his lack of size with outstanding elusiveness and deceptiveness with the puck, and answers the call in his own zone and on the penalty kill. Marner needs to get bulkier and stronger, but he has the potential to become a top forward. He's probably not going to play for Toronto next season, but he's a cornerstone of the franchise's rebuild. 5. Carolina Hurricanes - Noah Hanifin (D) Boston College With a wide arsenal of NHL-ready skills, the two attributes that push Noah Hanifin on top of the pack are his size and skating abilities. At 6’2, 203 pounds, the Norwood, Massachusetts-native plays with tremendous composure and finished just five points shy of Boston College’s team scoring race as a 17-year-old (23 points in 37 games). Hanifin excels at rushing up the ice and distributing the puck, but he understands good offense also means good defense. As a result, his transition to the defensive game is exceptional, and as a rookie, he was relied upon for edgy play in his own zone. Hanifin projects to be a top-pairing NHL defenseman because he can dictate the play offensively, absorb and adapt to the game defensively and he rarely makes mistakes. He'll get every opportunity to make the big club out of training camp. 6. New Jersey Devils - Pavel Zacha (C) Sarnia A challenging, inconsistent and injury-shortened rookie season in the OHL was not enough to drown out Zacha’s irresistible blend of size, speed and skill. The 6’3, 214 pounder may be a wild card due to his underwhelming results with Sarnia (34 points in 37 games) highlighting the Czech’s slow transition to North American style hockey. But with tender mitts and overwhelming grit, many scouts see this as a hurdle rather than a roadblock. Zacha’s dynamic stickhandling, blazing foot speed and booming shot parallel the tools of a top-line NHL scorer. His competitive drive is exceptional. He wants to be a difference maker and play physical, but those factors resulted in him taking two suspensions last season totaling eight games. Zacha has an abundance of raw skills and thus, massive potential. But the 18-year-old has a lot to prove and overcome before earning an NHL roster spot. 7. Philadelphia Flyers - Ivan Provorov (D) Brandon There are scouts who allege that Ivan Provorov is the best defenseman of the 2015 NHL Draft class, and the six-foot, 201-pounder certainly makes a case. Though he’s not as big or as fluid a skater as Noah Hanifan, Provorov’s strength, offensive talent and defensive ferocity have spurred comparisons to Duncan Keith and Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Playing on the top pairing for the WHL’s most dominant team, Provorov notched 61 points in 60 games with the Brandon Wheat Kings and took charge of the power play and penalty kill. He’s quick, intelligent, poised under pressure and commonly leads to impact physical plays. Provorov’s adeptness on the rush, at the point and battling in his own zone should lead to him having a long NHL career. Their Flyers' defense has been an ongoing issue for years and while they have made strides towards addressing that, Provorov is a big boost in that regard. 8. Columbus Blue Jackets - Zach Werenski (D) Michigan Much like Connor McDavid overshadowed Jack Eichel, Zach Werenski has the tools to be a top-pairing defenseman in the NHL, but has been overshadowed by fellow American Noah Hanifin. Werenski joined the Michigan Wolverines as a 17-year-old and played big-time minutes. The 6’2, 214 pounder proved to be an intelligent game manager through his skating mobility and poise with the puck. Werenski is aggressive on the forecheck, which can sometimes lead to him overextending himself and forcing plays. But he didn’t look out of place on the American blueline at the World Juniors, and notched 25 points in 35 games for the Wolverines as the youngest player in the NCAA. Werenski has some attributes he needs to refine such as amping up his physicality, but he possesses the raw skill and compete level to be a top-flight NHL defenseman. 9. San Jose Sharks - Timo Meier (RW) Halifax Meier is one of the more NHL-ready players from this year’s draft class and has the ability to step right into game action with his 6’1\", 209-pound body. He played for the Halifax Mooseheads of the QMJHL for the last two seasons and finished second on the team with 90 points (44 goals) in just 61 games last season. He also produced a franchise-record 23 power-play goals in 2014-2015. Meier can be a dominant winger and also play center to add versatility. He is a very bright player and is aware of game situations both in the offensive and defensive zone. The Swiss-born power forward was the highest-ranked player from the QMJHL and is particularly notable for his impeccable passes through traffic and hard, accurate shots on goal. He is the type of player you want on your team with his ability to create offense with his plethora of skill or shut down an opponent’s top line. 10. Colorado Avalanche - Mikko Rantanen (RW) TPS Turku (Finland) Rantanen is an enticing package of size, intelligence, and skill who is always a threat to score while on the ice. The 18-year-old Finnish prospect skated for TPS Turku of the Finnish Elite League last season where he registered nine goals and 19 assists in 56 games. He is an exceptional playmaker and speedy skater but he doesn’t play a physical game despite his 6’4\" frame. He rose to the number one ranked International skater in the Central Scouting final ranking prior to this year’s Draft. His style of play should fit in the NHL as he can protect the puck well and is difficult to check due to his size. In Rantanen, Colorado is getting a prospect that compares favorably to Ryan Getzlaf and Mikko Koivu in terms of upside. continue story » 11. Florida Panthers - Lawson Crouse (LW) Kingston At 6’4, 210 pounds, Crouse is amongst the biggest players in this draft and one of the most powerful. Though his 29-goal, 51-point output in 56 OHL games this season were below production standards for a top-10 forward pick, Crouse consistently made an impact by using his size, strength, positioning and puck skills. During the World Juniors, the London, Ontario-native proved to be a versatile two-way force, succeeding in his shutdown, bottom-six energy role with tournament champions. Crouse's prominence in the offensive zone is evident by his consistent ability to win physical battles, shield the puck, screen goaltenders and bury loose pucks. His NHL potential lies somewhere between a physical force on a top scoring line and a checking third-liner with offensive upside. 12. Dallas Stars - Denis Gurianov (RW) Lada Togliatti (Russia) Gurianov is the prototypical Russian winger. He has great size, speed and skill and he has produced solid offensive numbers throughout his young career. The 6’2, 192 pounder had one assist in eight games with Lada Togliatti in the KHL, but had a fantastic season with the club’s junior team in the MHL where he posted 15 goals and 25 points in 23 games. The risk with Guryanov doesn’t necessarily appear on the ice. Like any Russian who’s attached to a KHL team, there’s always a risk that the player’s arrival in North America may be delayed or worse, he may never show up. If Gurianov is willing to come to North America, he has the potential to be the steal of the 2015 Entry Draft. The Stars better hope so as they took a huge chance picking him at number 12. 13. Boston Bruins (via Los Angeles) - Jakub Zboril (D) Saint John The Bruins acquired the 13th overall pick from Los Angeles as part of the Milan Lucic trade. Zboril could be this year’s home run draft pick as he has the potential to be the complete package. He is one of the smarter players in the draft class and does all the little things right. The 6’2\" Czech-born defenseman is not afraid to get nasty and has no problem defending his teammates as evident by his 73 penalty minutes in 44 games with the Saint John Sea Dogs in the QMJHL last season. But don’t let that paint the full picture of who Zboril is as he tallied 13 goals, which is a franchise record for a rookie defenseman, and 33 points with a plus-two rating last season. The smooth skating defenseman has a never-ending motor, plays with poise and confidence and can even be a potential quarterback to power plays. Zboril’s biggest asset may be his positional play as he is very sound in all three areas of the ice. 14. Boston Bruins - Jake DeBrusk (LW) Swift Current What DeBrusk lacks in size, he makes up for with hard work and the will to battle in the dirty areas on the ice. The 5’11,\" 170-pound left winger has a knack for scoring and finding open ice in the offensive zone. DeBrusk is a natural sniper who has exceptional creativity and individual skill with his greatest strength being his compete level. Even though the 18-year-old, Edmonton-born forward doesn’t play a physical game, he will out work his opponents and is able to put up some big time scoring numbers as evident by his team-leading 42 goals and 81 points scored for the Swift Current Broncos in 72 WHL games last season. The son of former NHL player, Louie DeBrusk, he can create havoc on the forecheck and force defenders into making poor, rushed decisions that lead to goals for DeBrusk. He is an ultra-competitive, two-way forward who could eventually turn into a Zach Parise-type player down the line for the Bruins. 15. Boston Bruins (from Calgary) - Zachary Senyshyn (RW) Sault Ste. Marie Boston surprised many by selecting the 42nd-rated Senyshyn, who is a big, skilled winger with good hands and skating ability. The 6’2, 195 pounder spent his first full junior season with the OHL’s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 2014-15, where he scored 26 goals and 45 points in 66 games. Those numbers may not stand out compared to other offensive-minded players in this draft class, but when you consider that Senyshyn played mostly in a bottom-six role on a stacked Greyhounds team, his production appears to be more than reasonable. The native of Ottawa, Ontario will surely need more time in the junior ranks, but we should see a sizeable spike in his OHL numbers next season. He appears to have all the tools to develop into a top-six winger at the NHL level, but it won't be this season. 16. New York Islanders (from Edmonton via Pittsburgh) - Mathew Barzal (C) Seattle For Barzal, one of his greatest strengths is his lack of glaring weaknesses. As a playmaking center that is quick, smart with the puck and superb on defense, the six-foot, 183-pound Vancouver-native is an elite prospect despite missing 41 games to injury over the past two seasons. The small sample size hasn’t scared anyone off in predicting big things from Barzal, who has put up 107 points in 103 WHL games. Of the 57 points he scored in 2014-15, 45 were assists and 26 of those were primary assists. Barzal is a pass-first speedster who can be a force on either side of special teams. Scouts admire the pivot’s hockey I.Q, and warn his slick wrist shot could be just as lethal as his ability to distribute the puck. The Islanders traded defenseman Griffin Reinhart to Edmonton to get the 16th and 33rd overall picks and in Barzal they have gotten someone with top-six potential. 17. Winnipeg Jets - Kyle Connor (C) Youngstown (USHL) The Jets have a great stable of prospects and were in a position to take the best player available. Connor is a gritty, two-way player who impresses with skating and quickness. He has played for the USHL's Youngstown Phantoms for the past three seasons and led all players with 80 points in 56 games last season. The 6'1\", 177-pound winger is more of a playmaker than goal scorer as he averaged nearly an assist per game over the last two seasons with Youngstown. Connor has also made a name for himself internationally as he won gold with Team USA at the 2014 Under-18 World Junior Championship. During that tournament, the Michigan native scored four goals and three assists and tied for the lead with a plus eight rating in seven games. He has the potential to develop into an effective top-six forward in the NHL, but patience will be needed as he's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2015-2016 season. 18. Ottawa Senators - Thomas Chabot (D) Saint John Chabot is a two-way defenseman with great size and excellent puck skills and mobility. The 6’2\", 180-pound left-hander needs to bulk up in order to make it to the big stage, but has the potential to flourish into a very reliable all-around defenseman in the NHL. He has moved up the draft class ranks very rapidly and has quickly drawn lots of scouts’ attention. Chabot led all QMJHL blueliners with 41 points (12 goals, 29 assists) in 66 games last season and was able to improve his plus minus from a minus-29 in 2013-2014 to a plus-6 last season. In the 2015 Under-18 World Juniors, the Quebec native tied for the team lead among defensemen with five points in seven games. Chabot will need some more seasoning before he will make an impact in the NHL. 19. Detroit Red Wings - Evgeni Svechnikov (LW) Cape Breton Svechnikov is an electric, confident winger who oozes with potential. His 6’2\", 200-pound frame allows him to be aggressive on the forecheck and get physically engaged. The 18-year-old Russian is an incredibly talented and skilled winger who possesses slick skating and a lethal, accurate shot. Svechnikov came over from Russia in 2014 and played the 2014-2015 season with Cape Breton in the QMJHL where he was the team’s third leading scorer as a rookie. He amassed 32 goals and 78 points with 70 penalty minutes and a plus-19 rating in 55 games. He has adapted well to playing in North America and has learned the basics of the English language in just over a year. Svechnikov could develop into a deadly offensive threat in the NHL, but he shouldn't be expected to play at that level any time soon, especially seeing as Detroit loves to give its prospects plenty of development time in the minors. 20. Minnesota Wild - Joel Eriksson Ek (C) Farestads (Sweden) Eriksson Ek is a player that moved up the draft boards very quickly over the past few months and finished the NHL Central Scouting’s final ranks as the fourth best skater among European players. He is a 6'2\", 180-pound centerman who has a lethal shot and can be an offensive catalyst in the NHL for years to come. He uses his size well in tight situations and is a true power forward who is not afraid to go to the net and corners. Eriksson Ek can create scoring chances by using his size, puckhandling skills, and skating ability. In the 2014-15 season, he split time with Farjestad in the Swedish Hockey League, where he scored four goals and two assists in 34 games, and their junior affiliate team, where he posted 21 goals and 32 points in 25 games. Eriksson Ek also represented Sweden at the Under-18 World Juniors and scored a team best five goals and six points. continue story » 21. Ottawa (from Buffalo via New York Islanders) - Colin White (C) NTDP (USA) White is a strong two-way center who plays the game at a high level and can be an effective player even when he doesn’t have the puck due to his superior skating skills. The 6’0\", 183-pound Massachusetts-born forward is highly regarded for making players around him better and his ability to play in both the offensive and defensive zones. White played for the U.S. Under-18 National team in 2014-2015 scoring 23 goals and 54 points in 54 games played. He also notched the gold medal-clinching goal in overtime to defeat Finland at the 2015 Under-18 World Junior Championships. During that tournament, he scored six goals and added three assists in seven games en route to the gold medal. He is committed to playing the 2015-2016 season at Boston College but he should be an impact NHL player down the road. 22. Washington Capitals - Ilya Samsonov (G) Magnitogorsk (Russia) Samsonov is one of the top goaltenders in the 2015 Draft. The young Russian is big (6’3, 200 lbs) and technically sound for such a young player. The 18-year-old made his KHL debut this season with Magnitogorsk, where he allowed two goals in 21 minutes of action. Samsonov spent most of the year in the Russian Junior league, so he will definitely need more seasoning and development before he makes an impact at the NHL level. Washington doesn't have any need to rush him given Braden Holtby and Philipp Grubauer's youth, but that being said Samsonov is reportedly locked into the KHL for another three seasons. That's an awfully long time to wait to gain control of a first round pick and makes this pick a very big gamble in our minds. 23. Vancouver Canucks - Brock Boeser (RW) Waterloo (USHL) Boeser has been compared by scouts to Patrick Sharp with his natural scoring ability and his accurate and quick shot release. He is a two-way power forward who is effective at finding open space on the ice and has the ability to create scoring chances off the rush by finding open teammates with his great vision and ability to read the play. The 6-foot, 195-pound, right winger has an excellent first step and is able to quickly start and stop on the dime creating separation among defenders. At the same time, scouts are looking for Boeser to improve his defensive zone coverage as well as his board play. He played for the Waterloo Black Hawks of the USHL in the 2014-15 season where he tied for the league lead in goals with 35 and finished third in points with 68 in 57 games. He is a complete player who has the potential to become an elite-level scorer in the NHL. 24. Philadelphia Flyers (from Toronto via Nashville) - Travis Konecny (C) Ottawa Konecny is an extremely talented winger who has the ability to play center and has the determination to do anything to win a game. The 5’10\", 172-pound forward has skated for the Ottawa 67’s of the OHL the past two seasons where he scored a combined 55 goals and 138 points in 123 games. He was drafted first overall in the 2013 OHL Priority Selection draft and named the OHL’s Rookie of the Year in the 2013-2014 season. Konecny possesses above average hockey IQ, ultra-quick stickhandling skills, and a knack for scoring with his quick shot release. Combine that with his ability to play in all three zones of the ice and his willingness to play physical when needed and you’re looking at a potential game changer. Konecny will need some further time to develop before he makes his mark in the NHL. This could be a steal for the Flyers at number 24 as Konecny was as high as 11th on some lists. 25. Winnipeg Jets (from Buffalo via St. Louis) - Jack Roslovic (C) NTDP (USA) Roslovic is a fierce competitor with incredible playmaking skills and has been known to be a pass-first type player. He is an explosive skater and uses his speed to create plays and get the puck into high traffic areas. At 6’0,\" 185 pounds, the centerman needs to bulk up a bit, but will have time to mature as he’s committed to Miami University of Ohio for 2015-2016. In 25 games with the U.S. National Under-18 Team last season, Roslovic scored 11 goals and 38 points playing on a line with 2016 highly touted prospects, Austin Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk. His stock has skyrocketed this season as he was ranked 52nd among Central Scoutings midseason North American Skater rankings and ended up climbing to the point where Winnipeg felt confident taking him with a late first round pick. He is, as is the norm with picks at this point, a project, but could turn into a really solid contributor in the NHL in a few years. 26. Montreal Canadiens - Noah Juulsen (D) Everett Going into the 2014-15 campaign, Juulsen had already shown that he was capable of playing a responsible defensive game, but he made great strides at the other end of the ice with nine goals and 52 points in 68 contests. The 6-foot-1, 175-pound defenseman still has a lot of growing to do with the puck though. For example, while he has demonstrated some offensive creativity, he'll be expected to show growth in that regard. He also needs to be smarter in that regard and quicker on the transition when he's carrying that puck. That being said, he's capable of being a leader on the ice and he's willing to play a gritty game. There's certainly enough there to make him worth keeping in the back of your mind even if he's likely at least a couple years away from being an NHL regular. 27. Anaheim Ducks - Jacob Larsson (D) Frolunda (Sweden) Larsson is a 6’2,\" 192 pound, lanky defensemen who models his game after his favorite player, Oliver Ekman-Larsson. The Swedish born lefty is a smooth, mobile skater who makes smart plays and sees the ice well. He is an all-around defenseman who has high-end potential if he is able to bulk up and fill in his frame. Larsson spent the majority of the 2014-15 season with Frolunda’s junior team where he recorded eight goals and 11 assists in 30 games. He also played in 20 games with Frolunda’s top team last season, scoring a goal and two assists. On the international stage, Larsson was able to tally three assists in five games for team Sweden at the 2014 Under-18 World Juniors. His could be a solid top-four defenseman in the NHL down the line once he fills out a bit. Larsson will need more seasoning before he makes an impact in the NHL. 28. New York Islanders (from Tampa Bay via NY Rangers) - Anthony Beauvillier (LW) Shawinigan In order to get the 28th selection, the Islanders sent the 33rd and 72nd overall picks to Tampa Bay. This is a well-traveled pick as it was originally the New York Rangers' and sent to the Lightning as part of the Martin St. Louis deal. At just 5’10\" and 175 pounds, Beauvillier is a slippery, tenacious, hard-working forward who possesses an impressive skill set and plays with a non-stop engine. He is an offensive scorer with above average puck-handling skills, hockey sense, and speed. Scouts have pointed out that he needs to work on his discipline and bulk up, but he is known for leading by example on the ice. He is a relentless forechecker and never quits on the play. The Quebec-native had 42 goals, 94 points, and 72 penalty minutes in 67 QMJHL games last season. He was also a very efficient centerman, leading the league in faceoff wins last season. 29. Columbus (from Toronto via Philadelphia and Tampa Bay) - Gabriel Carlsson (D) Linkopings (Sweden) Carlsson is a big body, who is extremely smart in his own zone, but unlike fellow countrymen Erik Karlsson and Oliver Ekman-Larsson, he doesn't have much offensive upside. The 6’4, 183 pound Swede played for Linkoping in the Swedish junior league where he registered no goals, seven assists and 14 penalty minutes in 39 games. He also represented Sweden at the Ivan Hlinka (U18) tournament, where he registered one assist in five games. Although his ceiling might not be very high, he is an intriguing prospect because scouts know exactly what to expect from him at the next level. If he's able to improve his play with the puck even a little bit, he should be able to develop into a shutdown defenseman on an NHL roster. 30. Arizona Coyotes (from Chicago) - Nick Merkley (RW) Kelowna Merkley is an undersized forward with elite playmaking skills who can also play center at 5’10\" and 187 pounds. He creates scoring chances as good as anyone in this year’s draft class and his work ethic is second to none. Merkley’s critics have said he is not the strongest skater, but due to his extremely high hockey IQ, he can be a valuable asset in the NHL similar to the way Tyler Johnson has become. Despite his small frame, he is still not afraid to do the dirty work by battling in front of the net and pick up scoring chances the hard way. He has spent the last three seasons with the WHL’s Kelowna Rockets and scored 90 points (20 goals and 70 assists) with 79 penalty minutes in 2014-2015. All-in-all, he is a player with high upside due to his exceptional puckhandling ability and decision making. Merkley could be a steal at number 30 as many experts had him ranked in the top 15.",
    "LabBody": "Friday, June 26, 2015. It has been a wild afternoon in the NHL as the Bruins picked up the 13th pick for Milan Lucic after they earlier traded Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for the 15th pick as well as a couple of second round selections. They owned the 14th pick heading into the draft and the rumor is that they are interested in defenseman Noah Hanifan and could trade up with their multiple picks. Earlier, the Senators dealt goaltender Robin Lehner and forward David Legwand to Buffalo for the 21st overall selection. Expect a lot more trading to go on in the first round. Don’t forget, for everything NHL, check out Rotoworld's Player News, and follow @Rotoworld_ HK and @mfinewaxhockey on Twitter. 1. Edmonton Oilers - Connor McDavid (C) Erie. Connor McDavid is a once-in-a-generational talent who blends together the best skills of Hockey Hall of Famers at warp speed. He is blessed a 6’1, 190-pound frame, great character and an awesome array of moves that produced 169 points in just 67 games through the OHL regular season and playoffs. He is the catalyst for positive plays on every inch of the ice due to lightning-quick decision-making, a powerful stride, brilliant puck skills and his intuitive ability to find the open man or take his shot — no matter the quality or quantity of the defense he is facing. The Newmarket, Ontario-native appears to have the capacity to produce at over a point-per-game pace as a rookie and put together the type of career that ranks amongst the best of all time. His star power to the sport compares to what LeBron James brought to the NBA in 2003 and Andrew Luck brought to the NFL in 2012. 2. Buffalo Sabres - Jack Eichel (C) Boston University. Jack Eichel is the best consolation prize since the Pittsburgh Penguins snagged Evgeni Malkin second overall in the 2004 NHL Draft after Alex Ovechkin. The Chelmsford, Massachusetts-native has the size, speed and skill to single-handedly take the game up a notch every time he steps onto the ice. Coming off the most dominating NCAA season for a freshman since Paul Kariya in 1993, Eichel led Boston University to a conference title, led the nation in scoring with 71 points in 40 games and earned the Hobey Baker Award as the league’s best player. Highlighting Eichel’s deep collection of skills are his superior hockey IQ, his heavy shot, relentless work ethic and capable defensive prowess. The 18-year-old comes with all the trimmings of a franchise center and it's highly likely that we'll see him in the NHL next year. 3. Arizona Coyotes - Dylan Strome (C) Erie Otters. Strome was the OHL’s leading scorer (129 points in 68 games) and boasts a robust 6’3, 187-pound frame that has number-one NHL center potential written all over it. Strome thrives with the puck in open-ice and can find his teammates with his 360-degree vision, or finish off the play with his quick, accurate shot. While Connor McDavid was sidelined, Strome had a golden opportunity to prove he was not the byproduct of the projected superstar’s brilliance in Erie, and succeeded with 18 goals and 35 points in 21 games. Strome’s points-per-game dipped from two to 1.67 without McDavid, although for the most part the duo only played together on the power play anyways. Strome’s acceleration is a work in progress, as are his defensive game and physicality. Although there is room for fine-tuning, the Missiauga, Ontario-native’s strength, puckhandling skills and creativity have spurred comparisons to some of the best centers in the game. 4. Toronto Maple Leafs - Mitchell Marner (C) London Knights. Marner stands out as an impact player in all three zones of the rink — and it’s not because of his frame. At 5’11, 163-pounds, Marner is a lightweight with a heavy dose of electrifying offensive talent that belongs in the top-five of any draft class, including this year’s special crop. With 123 points in 63 games for the London Knights this year, Marner proved to be a tremendously talented force with elite speed, vision, hockey sense, a finishing touch and the ability to make people around him better. He overcomes his lack of size with outstanding elusiveness and deceptiveness with the puck, and answers the call in his own zone and on the penalty kill. Marner needs to get bulkier and stronger, but he has the potential to become a top forward. He's probably not going to play for Toronto next season, but he's a cornerstone of the franchise's rebuild. 5. Carolina Hurricanes - Noah Hanifin (D) Boston College. With a wide arsenal of NHL-ready skills, the two attributes that push Noah Hanifin on top of the pack are his size and skating abilities. At 6’2, 203 pounds, the Norwood, Massachusetts-native plays with tremendous composure and finished just five points shy of Boston College’s team scoring race as a 17-year-old (23 points in 37 games). Hanifin excels at rushing up the ice and distributing the puck, but he understands good offense also means good defense. As a result, his transition to the defensive game is exceptional, and as a rookie, he was relied upon for edgy play in his own zone. Hanifin projects to be a top-pairing NHL defenseman because he can dictate the play offensively, absorb and adapt to the game defensively and he rarely makes mistakes. He'll get every opportunity to make the big club out of training camp. 6. New Jersey Devils - Pavel Zacha (C) Sarnia. A challenging, inconsistent and injury-shortened rookie season in the OHL was not enough to drown out Zacha’s irresistible blend of size, speed and skill. The 6’3, 214 pounder may be a wild card due to his underwhelming results with Sarnia (34 points in 37 games) highlighting the Czech’s slow transition to North American style hockey. But with tender mitts and overwhelming grit, many scouts see this as a hurdle rather than a roadblock. Zacha’s dynamic stickhandling, blazing foot speed and booming shot parallel the tools of a top-line NHL scorer. His competitive drive is exceptional. He wants to be a difference maker and play physical, but those factors resulted in him taking two suspensions last season totaling eight games. Zacha has an abundance of raw skills and thus, massive potential. But the 18-year-old has a lot to prove and overcome before earning an NHL roster spot. 7. Philadelphia Flyers - Ivan Provorov (D) Brandon. There are scouts who allege that Ivan Provorov is the best defenseman of the 2015 NHL Draft class, and the six-foot, 201-pounder certainly makes a case. Though he’s not as big or as fluid a skater as Noah Hanifan, Provorov’s strength, offensive talent and defensive ferocity have spurred comparisons to Duncan Keith and Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Playing on the top pairing for the WHL’s most dominant team, Provorov notched 61 points in 60 games with the Brandon Wheat Kings and took charge of the power play and penalty kill. He’s quick, intelligent, poised under pressure and commonly leads to impact physical plays. Provorov’s adeptness on the rush, at the point and battling in his own zone should lead to him having a long NHL career. Their Flyers' defense has been an ongoing issue for years and while they have made strides towards addressing that, Provorov is a big boost in that regard. 8. Columbus Blue Jackets - Zach Werenski (D) Michigan. Much like Connor McDavid overshadowed Jack Eichel, Zach Werenski has the tools to be a top-pairing defenseman in the NHL, but has been overshadowed by fellow American Noah Hanifin. Werenski joined the Michigan Wolverines as a 17-year-old and played big-time minutes. The 6’2, 214 pounder proved to be an intelligent game manager through his skating mobility and poise with the puck. Werenski is aggressive on the forecheck, which can sometimes lead to him overextending himself and forcing plays. But he didn’t look out of place on the American blueline at the World Juniors, and notched 25 points in 35 games for the Wolverines as the youngest player in the NCAA. Werenski has some attributes he needs to refine such as amping up his physicality, but he possesses the raw skill and compete level to be a top-flight NHL defenseman. 9. San Jose Sharks - Timo Meier (RW) Halifax. Meier is one of the more NHL-ready players from this year’s draft class and has the ability to step right into game action with his 6’1\", 209-pound body. He played for the Halifax Mooseheads of the QMJHL for the last two seasons and finished second on the team with 90 points (44 goals) in just 61 games last season. He also produced a franchise-record 23 power-play goals in 2014-2015. Meier can be a dominant winger and also play center to add versatility. He is a very bright player and is aware of game situations both in the offensive and defensive zone. The Swiss-born power forward was the highest-ranked player from the QMJHL and is particularly notable for his impeccable passes through traffic and hard, accurate shots on goal. He is the type of player you want on your team with his ability to create offense with his plethora of skill or shut down an opponent’s top line. 10. Colorado Avalanche - Mikko Rantanen (RW) TPS Turku (Finland) Rantanen is an enticing package of size, intelligence, and skill who is always a threat to score while on the ice. The 18-year-old Finnish prospect skated for TPS Turku of the Finnish Elite League last season where he registered nine goals and 19 assists in 56 games. He is an exceptional playmaker and speedy skater but he doesn’t play a physical game despite his 6’4\" frame. He rose to the number one ranked International skater in the Central Scouting final ranking prior to this year’s Draft. His style of play should fit in the NHL as he can protect the puck well and is difficult to check due to his size. In Rantanen, Colorado is getting a prospect that compares favorably to Ryan Getzlaf and Mikko Koivu in terms of upside. It has been a wild afternoon in the NHL as the Bruins picked up the 13th pick for Milan Lucic after they earlier traded Dougie Hamilton to Calgary for the 15th pick as well as a couple of second round selections. They owned the 14th pick heading into the draft and the rumor is that they are interested in defenseman Noah Hanifan and could trade up with their multiple picks. Earlier, the Senators dealt goaltender Robin Lehner and forward David Legwand to Buffalo for the 21st overall selection. Expect a lot more trading to go on in the first round. Don’t forget, for everything NHL, check out Rotoworld's Player News, and follow @Rotoworld_ HK and @mfinewaxhockey on Twitter. 1. Edmonton Oilers - Connor McDavid (C) Erie. Connor McDavid is a once-in-a-generational talent who blends together the best skills of Hockey Hall of Famers at warp speed. He is blessed a 6’1, 190-pound frame, great character and an awesome array of moves that produced 169 points in just 67 games through the OHL regular season and playoffs. He is the catalyst for positive plays on every inch of the ice due to lightning-quick decision-making, a powerful stride, brilliant puck skills and his intuitive ability to find the open man or take his shot — no matter the quality or quantity of the defense he is facing. The Newmarket, Ontario-native appears to have the capacity to produce at over a point-per-game pace as a rookie and put together the type of career that ranks amongst the best of all time. His star power to the sport compares to what LeBron James brought to the NBA in 2003 and Andrew Luck brought to the NFL in 2012. 2. Buffalo Sabres - Jack Eichel (C) Boston University. Jack Eichel is the best consolation prize since the Pittsburgh Penguins snagged Evgeni Malkin second overall in the 2004 NHL Draft after Alex Ovechkin. The Chelmsford, Massachusetts-native has the size, speed and skill to single-handedly take the game up a notch every time he steps onto the ice. Coming off the most dominating NCAA season for a freshman since Paul Kariya in 1993, Eichel led Boston University to a conference title, led the nation in scoring with 71 points in 40 games and earned the Hobey Baker Award as the league’s best player.

San Jose Sharks - Timo Meier (RW) Halifax. Meier is one of the more NHL-ready players from this year’s draft class and has the ability to step right into game action with his 6’1\", 209-pound body. He played for the Halifax Mooseheads of the QMJHL for the last two seasons and finished second on the team with 90 points (44 goals) in just 61 games last season.

Colorado Avalanche - Mikko Rantanen (RW) TPS Turku (Finland) Rantanen is an enticing package of size, intelligence, and skill who is always a threat to score while on the ice. The 18-year-old Finnish prospect skated for TPS Turku of the Finnish Elite League last season where he registered nine goals and 19 assists in 56 games. He is an exceptional playmaker and speedy skater but he doesn’t play a physical game despite his 6’4\" frame. He rose to the number one ranked International skater in the Central Scouting final ranking prior to this year’s Draft. His style of play should fit in the NHL as he can protect the puck well and is difficult to check due to his size. In Rantanen, Colorado is getting a prospect that compares favorably to Ryan Getzlaf and Mikko Koivu in terms of upside. 11. Florida Panthers - Lawson Crouse (LW) Kingston At 6’4, 210 pounds, Crouse is amongst the biggest players in this draft and one of the most powerful. Though his 29-goal, 51-point output in 56 OHL games this season were below production standards for a top-10 forward pick, Crouse consistently made an impact by using his size, strength, positioning and puck skills. During the World Juniors, the London, Ontario-native proved to be a versatile two-way force, succeeding in his shutdown, bottom-six energy role with tournament champions. Crouse's prominence in the offensive zone is evident by his consistent ability to win physical battles, shield the puck, screen goaltenders and bury loose pucks. His NHL potential lies somewhere between a physical force on a top scoring line and a checking third-liner with offensive upside. 12. Dallas Stars - Denis Gurianov (RW) Lada Togliatti (Russia) Gurianov is the prototypical Russian winger. He has great size, speed and skill and he has produced solid offensive numbers throughout his young career. The 6’2, 192 pounder had one assist in eight games with Lada Togliatti in the KHL, but had a fantastic season with the club’s junior team in the MHL where he posted 15 goals and 25 points in 23 games. The risk with Guryanov doesn’t necessarily appear on the ice. Like any Russian who’s attached to a KHL team, there’s always a risk that the player’s arrival in North America may be delayed or worse, he may never show up. If Gurianov is willing to come to North America, he has the potential to be the steal of the 2015 Entry Draft. The Stars better hope so as they took a huge chance picking him at number 12. 13. Boston Bruins (via Los Angeles) - Jakub Zboril (D) Saint John. The Bruins acquired the 13th overall pick from Los Angeles as part of the Milan Lucic trade. Zboril could be this year’s home run draft pick as he has the potential to be the complete package. He is one of the smarter players in the draft class and does all the little things right. The 6’2\" Czech-born defenseman is not afraid to get nasty and has no problem defending his teammates as evident by his 73 penalty minutes in 44 games with the Saint John Sea Dogs in the QMJHL last season. But don’t let that paint the full picture of who Zboril is as he tallied 13 goals, which is a franchise record for a rookie defenseman, and 33 points with a plus-two rating last season. The smooth skating defenseman has a never-ending motor, plays with poise and confidence and can even be a potential quarterback to power plays. Zboril’s biggest asset may be his positional play as he is very sound in all three areas of the ice. 14. Boston Bruins - Jake DeBrusk (LW) Swift Current. What DeBrusk lacks in size, he makes up for with hard work and the will to battle in the dirty areas on the ice. The 5’11,\" 170-pound left winger has a knack for scoring and finding open ice in the offensive zone. DeBrusk is a natural sniper who has exceptional creativity and individual skill with his greatest strength being his compete level. Even though the 18-year-old, Edmonton-born forward doesn’t play a physical game, he will out work his opponents and is able to put up some big time scoring numbers as evident by his team-leading 42 goals and 81 points scored for the Swift Current Broncos in 72 WHL games last season. The son of former NHL player, Louie DeBrusk, he can create havoc on the forecheck and force defenders into making poor, rushed decisions that lead to goals for DeBrusk. He is an ultra-competitive, two-way forward who could eventually turn into a Zach Parise-type player down the line for the Bruins. 15. Boston Bruins (from Calgary) - Zachary Senyshyn (RW) Sault Ste. Marie. Boston surprised many by selecting the 42nd-rated Senyshyn, who is a big, skilled winger with good hands and skating ability. The 6’2, 195 pounder spent his first full junior season with the OHL’s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 2014-15, where he scored 26 goals and 45 points in 66 games. Those numbers may not stand out compared to other offensive-minded players in this draft class, but when you consider that Senyshyn played mostly in a bottom-six role on a stacked Greyhounds team, his production appears to be more than reasonable. The native of Ottawa, Ontario will surely need more time in the junior ranks, but we should see a sizeable spike in his OHL numbers next season. He appears to have all the tools to develop into a top-six winger at the NHL level, but it won't be this season. 16. New York Islanders (from Edmonton via Pittsburgh) - Mathew Barzal (C) Seattle. For Barzal, one of his greatest strengths is his lack of glaring weaknesses. As a playmaking center that is quick, smart with the puck and superb on defense, the six-foot, 183-pound Vancouver-native is an elite prospect despite missing 41 games to injury over the past two seasons. The small sample size hasn’t scared anyone off in predicting big things from Barzal, who has put up 107 points in 103 WHL games. Of the 57 points he scored in 2014-15, 45 were assists and 26 of those were primary assists. Barzal is a pass-first speedster who can be a force on either side of special teams. Scouts admire the pivot’s hockey I.Q, and warn his slick wrist shot could be just as lethal as his ability to distribute the puck. The Islanders traded defenseman Griffin Reinhart to Edmonton to get the 16th and 33rd overall picks and in Barzal they have gotten someone with top-six potential. 17. Winnipeg Jets - Kyle Connor (C) Youngstown (USHL) The Jets have a great stable of prospects and were in a position to take the best player available. Connor is a gritty, two-way player who impresses with skating and quickness. He has played for the USHL's Youngstown Phantoms for the past three seasons and led all players with 80 points in 56 games last season. The 6'1\", 177-pound winger is more of a playmaker than goal scorer as he averaged nearly an assist per game over the last two seasons with Youngstown. Connor has also made a name for himself internationally as he won gold with Team USA at the 2014 Under-18 World Junior Championship. During that tournament, the Michigan native scored four goals and three assists and tied for the lead with a plus eight rating in seven games. He has the potential to develop into an effective top-six forward in the NHL, but patience will be needed as he's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2015-2016 season. 18. Ottawa Senators - Thomas Chabot (D) Saint John. Chabot is a two-way defenseman with great size and excellent puck skills and mobility. The 6’2\", 180-pound left-hander needs to bulk up in order to make it to the big stage, but has the potential to flourish into a very reliable all-around defenseman in the NHL. He has moved up the draft class ranks very rapidly and has quickly drawn lots of scouts’ attention. Chabot led all QMJHL blueliners with 41 points (12 goals, 29 assists) in 66 games last season and was able to improve his plus minus from a minus-29 in 2013-2014 to a plus-6 last season. In the 2015 Under-18 World Juniors, the Quebec native tied for the team lead among defensemen with five points in seven games. Chabot will need some more seasoning before he will make an impact in the NHL. 19. Detroit Red Wings - Evgeni Svechnikov (LW) Cape Breton. Svechnikov is an electric, confident winger who oozes with potential. His 6’2\", 200-pound frame allows him to be aggressive on the forecheck and get physically engaged. The 18-year-old Russian is an incredibly talented and skilled winger who possesses slick skating and a lethal, accurate shot. Svechnikov came over from Russia in 2014 and played the 2014-2015 season with Cape Breton in the QMJHL where he was the team’s third leading scorer as a rookie. He amassed 32 goals and 78 points with 70 penalty minutes and a plus-19 rating in 55 games. He has adapted well to playing in North America and has learned the basics of the English language in just over a year. Svechnikov could develop into a deadly offensive threat in the NHL, but he shouldn't be expected to play at that level any time soon, especially seeing as Detroit loves to give its prospects plenty of development time in the minors. 20. Minnesota Wild - Joel Eriksson Ek (C) Farestads (Sweden) Eriksson Ek is a player that moved up the draft boards very quickly over the past few months and finished the NHL Central Scouting’s final ranks as the fourth best skater among European players. He is a 6'2\", 180-pound centerman who has a lethal shot and can be an offensive catalyst in the NHL for years to come. He uses his size well in tight situations and is a true power forward who is not afraid to go to the net and corners. Eriksson Ek can create scoring chances by using his size, puckhandling skills, and skating ability. In the 2014-15 season, he split time with Farjestad in the Swedish Hockey League, where he scored four goals and two assists in 34 games, and their junior affiliate team, where he posted 21 goals and 32 points in 25 games. Eriksson Ek also represented Sweden at the Under-18 World Juniors and scored a team best five goals and six points. 21. Ottawa (from Buffalo via New York Islanders) - Colin White (C) NTDP (USA) White is a strong two-way center who plays the game at a high level and can be an effective player even when he doesn’t have the puck due to his superior skating skills. The 6’0\", 183-pound Massachusetts-born forward is highly regarded for making players around him better and his ability to play in both the offensive and defensive zones. White played for the U.S. Under-18 National team in 2014-2015 scoring 23 goals and 54 points in 54 games played. He also notched the gold medal-clinching goal in overtime to defeat Finland at the 2015 Under-18 World Junior Championships. During that tournament, he scored six goals and added three assists in seven games en route to the gold medal. He is committed to playing the 2015-2016 season at Boston College but he should be an impact NHL player down the road. 22. Washington Capitals - Ilya Samsonov (G) Magnitogorsk (Russia) Samsonov is one of the top goaltenders in the 2015 Draft. The young Russian is big (6’3, 200 lbs) and technically sound for such a young player. The 18-year-old made his KHL debut this season with Magnitogorsk, where he allowed two goals in 21 minutes of action. Samsonov spent most of the year in the Russian Junior league, so he will definitely need more seasoning and development before he makes an impact at the NHL level. Washington doesn't have any need to rush him given Braden Holtby and Philipp Grubauer's youth, but that being said Samsonov is reportedly locked into the KHL for another three seasons. That's an awfully long time to wait to gain control of a first round pick and makes this pick a very big gamble in our minds. 23. Vancouver Canucks - Brock Boeser (RW) Waterloo (USHL) Boeser has been compared by scouts to Patrick Sharp with his natural scoring ability and his accurate and quick shot release. He is a two-way power forward who is effective at finding open space on the ice and has the ability to create scoring chances off the rush by finding open teammates with his great vision and ability to read the play. The 6-foot, 195-pound, right winger has an excellent first step and is able to quickly start and stop on the dime creating separation among defenders. At the same time, scouts are looking for Boeser to improve his defensive zone coverage as well as his board play. He played for the Waterloo Black Hawks of the USHL in the 2014-15 season where he tied for the league lead in goals with 35 and finished third in points with 68 in 57 games. He is a complete player who has the potential to become an elite-level scorer in the NHL. 24. Philadelphia Flyers (from Toronto via Nashville) - Travis Konecny (C) Ottawa. Konecny is an extremely talented winger who has the ability to play center and has the determination to do anything to win a game. The 5’10\", 172-pound forward has skated for the Ottawa 67’s of the OHL the past two seasons where he scored a combined 55 goals and 138 points in 123 games. He was drafted first overall in the 2013 OHL Priority Selection draft and named the OHL’s Rookie of the Year in the 2013-2014 season. Konecny possesses above average hockey IQ, ultra-quick stickhandling skills, and a knack for scoring with his quick shot release. Combine that with his ability to play in all three zones of the ice and his willingness to play physical when needed and you’re looking at a potential game changer. Konecny will need some further time to develop before he makes his mark in the NHL. This could be a steal for the Flyers at number 24 as Konecny was as high as 11th on some lists. 25. Winnipeg Jets (from Buffalo via St. Louis) - Jack Roslovic (C) NTDP (USA) Roslovic is a fierce competitor with incredible playmaking skills and has been known to be a pass-first type player. He is an explosive skater and uses his speed to create plays and get the puck into high traffic areas. At 6’0,\" 185 pounds, the centerman needs to bulk up a bit, but will have time to mature as he’s committed to Miami University of Ohio for 2015-2016. In 25 games with the U.S. National Under-18 Team last season, Roslovic scored 11 goals and 38 points playing on a line with 2016 highly touted prospects, Austin Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk. His stock has skyrocketed this season as he was ranked 52nd among Central Scoutings midseason North American Skater rankings and ended up climbing to the point where Winnipeg felt confident taking him with a late first round pick. He is, as is the norm with picks at this point, a project, but could turn into a really solid contributor in the NHL in a few years. 26. Montreal Canadiens - Noah Juulsen (D) Everett. Going into the 2014-15 campaign, Juulsen had already shown that he was capable of playing a responsible defensive game, but he made great strides at the other end of the ice with nine goals and 52 points in 68 contests. The 6-foot-1, 175-pound defenseman still has a lot of growing to do with the puck though. For example, while he has demonstrated some offensive creativity, he'll be expected to show growth in that regard. He also needs to be smarter in that regard and quicker on the transition when he's carrying that puck. That being said, he's capable of being a leader on the ice and he's willing to play a gritty game. There's certainly enough there to make him worth keeping in the back of your mind even if he's likely at least a couple years away from being an NHL regular. 27. Anaheim Ducks - Jacob Larsson (D) Frolunda (Sweden) Larsson is a 6’2,\" 192 pound, lanky defensemen who models his game after his favorite player, Oliver Ekman-Larsson. The Swedish born lefty is a smooth, mobile skater who makes smart plays and sees the ice well. He is an all-around defenseman who has high-end potential if he is able to bulk up and fill in his frame. Larsson spent the majority of the 2014-15 season with Frolunda’s junior team where he recorded eight goals and 11 assists in 30 games. He also played in 20 games with Frolunda’s top team last season, scoring a goal and two assists. On the international stage, Larsson was able to tally three assists in five games for team Sweden at the 2014 Under-18 World Juniors. His could be a solid top-four defenseman in the NHL down the line once he fills out a bit. Larsson will need more seasoning before he makes an impact in the NHL. 28. New York Islanders (from Tampa Bay via NY Rangers) - Anthony Beauvillier (LW) Shawinigan. In order to get the 28th selection, the Islanders sent the 33rd and 72nd overall picks to Tampa Bay. This is a well-traveled pick as it was originally the New York Rangers' and sent to the Lightning as part of the Martin St. Louis deal. At just 5’10\" and 175 pounds, Beauvillier is a slippery, tenacious, hard-working forward who possesses an impressive skill set and plays with a non-stop engine. He is an offensive scorer with above average puck-handling skills, hockey sense, and speed. Scouts have pointed out that he needs to work on his discipline and bulk up, but he is known for leading by example on the ice. He is a relentless forechecker and never quits on the play. The Quebec-native had 42 goals, 94 points, and 72 penalty minutes in 67 QMJHL games last season. He was also a very efficient centerman, leading the league in faceoff wins last season. 29. Columbus (from Toronto via Philadelphia and Tampa Bay) - Gabriel Carlsson (D) Linkopings (Sweden) Carlsson is a big body, who is extremely smart in his own zone, but unlike fellow countrymen Erik Karlsson and Oliver Ekman-Larsson, he doesn't have much offensive upside. The 6’4, 183 pound Swede played for Linkoping in the Swedish junior league where he registered no goals, seven assists and 14 penalty minutes in 39 games. He also represented Sweden at the Ivan Hlinka (U18) tournament, where he registered one assist in five games. Although his ceiling might not be very high, he is an intriguing prospect because scouts know exactly what to expect from him at the next level. If he's able to improve his play with the puck even a little bit, he should be able to develop into a shutdown defenseman on an NHL roster. 30. Arizona Coyotes (from Chicago) - Nick Merkley (RW) Kelowna. Merkley is an undersized forward with elite playmaking skills who can also play center at 5’10\" and 187 pounds. He creates scoring chances as good as anyone in this year’s draft class and his work ethic is second to none. Merkley’s critics have said he is not the strongest skater, but due to his extremely high hockey IQ, he can be a valuable asset in the NHL similar to the way Tyler Johnson has become. Despite his small frame, he is still not afraid to do the dirty work by battling in front of the net and pick up scoring chances the hard way. He has spent the last three seasons with the WHL’s Kelowna Rockets and scored 90 points (20 goals and 70 assists) with 79 penalty minutes in 2014-2015. All-in-all, he is a player with high upside due to his exceptional puckhandling ability and decision making. Merkley could be a steal at number 30 as many experts had him ranked in the top 15. continue story » Michael Finewax is entering his 10th season as the Senior Hockey Writer and Editor for Rotoworld.

    "LabBody": "An 18-year-old man discovered passed out drunk in the Bartlett driveway about sunrise had all the markings for the end of a special night to go with the booze. Some Acqua Di Gio and Polo cologne to smell good. An iPod for tunes and maybe dancing. Some expensive white Oakley sunglasses and even a New Era baseball cap. But when he was hauled to jail on the public intoxication charge, he told jailers that wasn’t his stuff. He acknowledged taking the goods from unlocked cars — by his own estimate 15 to 30 cars, according to police reports. Jonathan Gibson pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of theft on Wednesday, a day after he was found unconscious in a driveway on Evening Light. He is scheduled to return to court later this month to see if he qualifies for diversion. Police still are trying to track down the victims, but appeared a bit stymied by the lack of reports from people who discovered their property missing. Only one victim — a Bartlett police officer who heard about the thefts around the department — claimed any of the property, identifying the Oakleys and the blue New Era cap as taken from a vehicle at his house. Reports state officers responded to a suspicious person call about 5:50 a.m. Tuesday — suspicious because the man was passed out in the driveway. Officers roused Gibson and smelled alcohol. Unsteady on his feet, he was arrested for public intoxication. Police said he was unsure of where he was or how he got there. During questioning, Gibson also couldn’t remember his name and told officers he was born in 1920, meaning he would have to be 95 years old. When Gibson arrived at headquarters and jailers were documenting the belongings, he told them only his belt and cellphone were his property. He said the rest of the stuff was taken from cars he entered. Gibson told authorities he was looking for anything of value to sell. That led to the burglary from an automobile charge, which was reduced to theft in exchange for his guilty plea. With only one victim claiming the property, authorities were unable to determine if Gibson actually rummaged through up to 30 cars, or if the claim was as accurate as his 1920 date of birth.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Many Cambridge City Councilors say they feel rushed as they weigh in a Planning Board petition to amend the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center parcel in Kendall Square. The petition, a conceptual framework of what could be built on the parcel, proposes changes to the city’s PUD-KS District, which is mostly occupied by the Volpe site. The Planning Board and Ordinance Committee must vote on the petition, which will then go before the City Council. As part of the process, the city released three-dimensional models of four theoretical scenarios for the Volpe parcel, including a large 1,000-foot commercial tower. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the federal Department of Transportation are hoping to convert the existing 14-acre campus — composed of six buildings built in the 1960s and in need of major repairs and alterations — into a new state-of-the-art facility of up to 400,000 gross square feet for up to 1,300 personnel and parking spaces. GSA issued a request for information last August from developers interested in acquiring the land and expanding the development. The government is looking for a company to create a new home for the transportation center on Broadway, Third and Binney streets in exchange for ownership of a portion of the land. The part of the site — approximately three acres — that would remain under federal ownership would be designed and constructed in accordance to federal government standards. However, the approximate 11 acres conveyed out to exchange partners would be subject to Cambridge laws. The goal of the proposed petition is to set forth the zoning that would apply to the developer’s part of the process, according to Planning Board Chairman H. Theodore Cohen. “We’re setting up zoning for what we would like to see occur,” Cohen said on Monday at a joint Ordinance Committee and Planning Board meeting, adding that the Planning Board will likely make a recommendation to City Council at its next meeting on July 14. According to a letter from Cohen to the City Council, the proposed changes aim to implement zoning recommendations of the Kendall Square K2 Study, as well as objectives that have been discussed since the completion of the study. Under the petition, 10 percent of the total housing must be affordable and available to low- and moderate-income households, and five percent must be available to middle-income households. Some councilors, however, say 10 percent affordable housing just isn’t adequate. “Sometimes I feel that there are numbers that are put out there without backup,” Councilor Marc McGovern said. “I think we should be shooting for closer to 25 percent, certainly no less than 20. We’re getting 20 percent in other developments now.” » Comment or view comments",
    "LabBody": "Page 2 of 4. - “I want to push it to the point in which the developer screams but doesn’t run away,” he added. Planning Board members discussed having a requirement of up to 20 percent affordable units, but most members supported the minimum 10 percent stipulation, according to Cohen. Planning Board Vice-Chair Catherine Preston Connolly said board members wanted as much affordable housing as possible, but they were concerned about the high cost of the project. “The federal government requires that their new building be completely constructed, finished and move-in ready before you can take down the Volpe building,” Preston Connolly said. “They have to do that and have all the costs associated with building that before the developer can start anything [on the other parcel].” The Cambridge Residents Alliance feels the city must increase the proportion of residential to commercial units, according to Vice President Lee Farris. The group, Farris said, wants the maximum commercial space to be 40 percent instead of 60 percent. “Because Cambridge doesn’t have a lot of affordable housing and people are being displaced, it is unacceptable that the amount of affordable to low- and moderate-income housing would be reduced to 10 percent from 11.5 percent,” Farris said, adding that any increase above the current FAR (Floor Area Ratio) should go to housing. The petition requires retail and other active ground-floor space along major streets, with incentives for small retail spaces. But councilors want to see diverse ground-floor retail with affordable establishments that respect the neighborhood, such as supermarkets and mom-and-pop stores. “We have to meet the right language that gives us affordable retail,” Councilor Denise Simmons said. “There’s a feeling in the community that Kendall Square is for the intelligentsia of Cambridge and that Central Square is for the people that don’t have nine degrees behind their name and that shouldn’t be the feeling. We have to be very thoughtful and deliberate.” Open space. The current zoning calls for redevelopment of the site to include 7.5 acres of open space – more than half of the total acreage. The zoning also allows development at a 3.0 FAR. Therefore, large development parcels would be required to have a minimum of 40 percent of residential development, and at least 42 percent of the development parcel must be open space, including an area devoted to a public park. The petition, on the other hand, requests that at least 25 percent of the site (3.5 acres) be devoted to open space and five percent of the community space be allocated to innovation space, including startups. Several residents raised concerns about the open-space stipulation, including members of the East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) who said the city did not contact the group prior to drafting such an important petition.",

Don't wear flashy jewelry or items that can reflect sunlight 4. Don't wear bright bathing suits 5.

But in doing so, Discovery has provoked blowback from conservation groups, who charge its unremitting demonization of the ocean's top predator has resulted in needless fear and the gratuitous slaughter of sharks. And Discovery Channel's new president, Rich Ross, has said \"Shark Week 2015\" will not feature any new fake documentaries. In fact, wary ichthyologist Robert Hueter, senior scientist and director of shark research at Sarasota's Mote Marine Laboratory, agreed to work with Discovery during a February expedition to Cuba. kill this line for printThat groundbreaking initiative, in which American and Cuban scientists placed the first satellite transmitters on sharks in Cuban waters, airs at 10 p.m. Tuesday in an episode called \"Tiburones: The Sharks of Cuba.\" A student of sharks for more than 40 years, author of more than 150 related papers, Hueter addressed common misconceptions about sharks in an interview we'll call \"Five Things You Should Know About Sharks\": 1. Christmas tree lights are more dangerous. More people are electrocuted by Christmas tree lights each year than are killed in shark attacks. \"When you look at the numbers, sharks bite less than 100 people a year. Last year we had a total of 72 or 74 in the entire world and three were fatal. On the other side of the ledger, fishing activities around the world take about 100 million sharks every year. ... Approximately 1 million sharks are killed for every person that is bitten by a shark. ... A human life and a shark's life are not to be equated, but the real danger is to sharks more than it is to us.\" 2. Our planet needs sharks. Robust shark populations are vital to Earth's ecology. \"We're removing somewhere around 100 million sharks every year from the world's oceans. That's a huge amount and that's not sustainable. ... Sharks are what we call top predators in the ocean system. They sit on top of these food webs or food pyramids, and if we were to totally eliminate the sharks, it would cause ripple effects all the way down the food web and actually destroy certain ecosystems. ... For example, very good research that has been done in the Caribbean Sea or Pacific showed that when sharks are removed, the coral reef died.\" 3. There are no Freddy Kruegers in the shark realm. \"There are about 500 species of sharks in the world, and of those 500 species, about a dozen of them have been implicated in bites on people. What we call the 'Big Three' are the white shark, the tiger shark and the bull shark because these are animals that get to be fairly big bodied and they do go after larger prey. They'll go after other sharks. They'll go after marine mammals and big rays and so on. ... They're not looking for us. They're looking for a prey fish. ... Yes, we have white sharks out in the Gulf of Mexico and, yes, they can be relatively large, but they don't come in close to the beach at all. We've been tracking white sharks for the last few years that come into the Gulf. I think the closest they've come to this coastline is about 40 or 50 miles away. ... That's actually a very rare animal. Most sharks top out at about 6 feet long. Most of them are not interested in people. We're definitely not on their menu.\" 4. Call it a bite, not an attack. \"Most of the incidents of the unprovoked attacks — which I prefer to call bites — most of these are by smaller sharks like the blacktip shark, which is a more numerous animal. It's a fast swimmer. It's a fish eater. And this is the shark that is going through the surf and will sometimes make a mistake and grab someone's hand or foot or calf, let go, and that will be the end of that. ... We do get some shark incidents around the Fourth of July, and the reason is not because of the number of sharks, but because of the number of people in the water that weekend. Everybody goes to the beach. It's a hot time of year. Sharks are feeding. It's their time as well. When you get so many people in the water, sometimes paths cross and somebody gets bitten. ... A lot of people are in the water where sharks are feeding and the sharks sometimes see a surfer's foot or a swimmer's hand and come up and bite and go 'That's not right' and leave.\" 5. Where the sharks are. Some waters really do produce more shark bites than others. \"This is more of an issue on the east coast of Florida: Volusia County, around Daytona Beach, Brevard County, a place we call 'Shark Alley,' where we get as many as a couple of dozen bites on people a year. And the problem there is this heavy surf. ... As we go farther north and get into colder climates on the East Coast, the fauna begins to change. The shark species begin to change. You get species like the sandbar shark, which happens to migrate down here in the winter time. ... And then you get Mako sharks, blue sharks, and finally, again, the great white, which is really a cooler water animal that prefers to eat large prey when they get really big ... like seals that live in the northeast in places like Cape Cod. ... The more serious injuries are off California by white sharks. Hawaii sometimes has serious attacks by tiger sharks. Those are not more numerous than Florida, but they're typically more serious.\" Billy Cox and Jessica Floum write for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. All rights reserved.

Robust shark populations are vital to Earth's ecology. \"We're removing somewhere around 100 million sharks every year from the world's oceans. That's a huge amount and that's not sustainable. ... Sharks are what we call top predators in the ocean system. They sit on top of these food webs or food pyramids, and if we were to totally eliminate the sharks, it would cause ripple effects all the way down the food web and actually destroy certain ecosystems. ... For example, very good research that has been done in the Caribbean Sea or Pacific showed that when sharks are removed, the coral reef died.\" 3. There are no Freddy Kruegers in the shark realm. \"There are about 500 species of sharks in the world, and of those 500 species, about a dozen of them have been implicated in bites on people. What we call the 'Big Three' are the white shark, the tiger shark and the bull shark because these are animals that get to be fairly big bodied and they do go after larger prey. They'll go after other sharks. They'll go after marine mammals and big rays and so on. ... They're not looking for us. They're looking for a prey fish. ... Yes, we have white sharks out in the Gulf of Mexico and, yes, they can be relatively large, but they don't come in close to the beach at all. We've been tracking white sharks for the last few years that come into the Gulf. I think the closest they've come to this coastline is about 40 or 50 miles away. ... That's actually a very rare animal. Most sharks top out at about 6 feet long. Most of them are not interested in people. We're definitely not on their menu.\" 4. Call it a bite, not an attack. \"Most of the incidents of the unprovoked attacks — which I prefer to call bites — most of these are by smaller sharks like the blacktip shark, which is a more numerous animal. It's a fast swimmer. It's a fish eater. And this is the shark that is going through the surf and will sometimes make a mistake and grab someone's hand or foot or calf, let go, and that will be the end of that. ... We do get some shark incidents around the Fourth of July, and the reason is not because of the number of sharks, but because of the number of people in the water that weekend. Everybody goes to the beach. It's a hot time of year. Sharks are feeding. It's their time as well. When you get so many people in the water, sometimes paths cross and somebody gets bitten. ... A lot of people are in the water where sharks are feeding and the sharks sometimes see a surfer's foot or a swimmer's hand and come up and bite and go 'That's not right' and leave.\" 5. Where the sharks are. Some waters really do produce more shark bites than others. \"This is more of an issue on the east coast of Florida: Volusia County, around Daytona Beach, Brevard County, a place we call 'Shark Alley,' where we get as many as a couple of dozen bites on people a year. And the problem there is this heavy surf. ... As we go farther north and get into colder climates on the East Coast, the fauna begins to change. The shark species begin to change. You get species like the sandbar shark, which happens to migrate down here in the winter time. ... And then you get Mako sharks, blue sharks, and finally, again, the great white, which is really a cooler water animal that prefers to eat large prey when they get really big ... like seals that live in the northeast in places like Cape Cod. ...

Your body uses amino acids -- the nutrients obtained from protein -- as building blocks to build new proteins, cells and tissues. The protein in one egg provides 12 percent of the daily protein requirements for an average 135-pound person, and 9 percent for an average 180-pound person. Benefits Eggs provide a valuable source of protein and an inexpensive ingredient useful in cooking. Protein helps a person feel full longer and contributes to a healthy weight. Egg yolks provide a good source of choline that contributes to fetal brain development and prevention of birth defects. Choline helps adults maintain the structure of brain cell membranes and transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, according to IncredibleEgg.org.

Controversey Many adults read contradictory information about what foods to eat and what to avoid to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death in America. Many Americans avoid eggs because of their cholesterol content although, according to Eleanor Whitney and Sharon Rolfes in “Understanding Nutrition,” the American Heart Association approves an intake of up to four eggs a week and some research suggests that one egg per day is not detrimental for healthy people. However, some people are sensitive to cholesterol in their diet, and as a result the American Heart Association still recommends limiting your cholesterol intake. Considerations and Risks Persons on a strict low cholesterol diet must limit the use of egg yolks. Food manufacturers and most supermarkets offer several nonfat, no cholesterol egg substitutes. Limiting saturated fat is, for most people, more effective at lowering blood cholesterol than limiting dietary cholesterol, according to Eleanor Whitney and Sharon Rolfes in “Understanding Nutrition.” To prevent food-borne illnesses, use clean eggs with intact shells.

    "DiffbotBody": "Step 1 Get a healthy nutrition plan. Work with a dietitian to design a nutrition plan for you that focuses on improving your health and helping you to lose weight. Your nutrition plan should be low in saturated fat (usually animal fats), high in vegetables and fruits, contain lean meats and use healthy vegetable oils such as coconut, safflower, sunflower, olive, avocado and grapeseed oils when cooking. In addition to your meal plan being low in saturated fat, eat complex carbohydrates such as beans, lentils and sprouted grains for energy and fiber. Step 2 Exercise at least 60 minutes per day, which helps you lose and manage your weight. A weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight can help reduce visceral fat stores. The only way to reduce visceral fat stores is to burn more calories than you consume. Engage in physical activity such as circuit training, brisk walking, biking and any activity that gets your heart rate up and you moving for an hour. Step 3 Stay motivated. Weight loss takes time. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect to lose weight overnight because you didn\u0026rsquo;t gain it quickly. According to the JAMA, just a modest amount of weight loss will improve your visceral fat stores and other medical complications you have. Use that as motivation to stick with your eating and exercise program. Step 4 Stop practicing unhealthy lifestyle habits. Stop smoking, drinking, being inactive, and eating high-fat, processed foods. Choosing healthier lifestyle choices will improve your quality of life and will show up in inches lost as stated in the Guidelines for Overweight and Obesity.",
    "LabBody": "Visceral fat is stored around your internal organs in your stomach region. The problem with visceral fat is that too much around your organs can interfere with how your liver functions. This can lead to insulin resistance (the beginning of diabetes), high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and a higher risk for developing heart disease. Having a waistline greater than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women is a sign of large visceral fat stores, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). An increased waistline, high blood pressure, high triglycerides (fat in the blood), low HDL (\u0026quot;good\u0026quot; cholesterol) and rising blood sugar characterizes Syndrome X, which starts with high visceral fat stores. Lifestyle changes will help promote usage of visceral fat and lower your risk factors for developing heart disease. Step 1. Get a healthy nutrition plan.

Engage in physical activity such as circuit training, brisk walking, biking and any activity that gets your heart rate up and you moving for an hour. Step 3. Stay motivated. Weight loss takes time. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect to lose weight overnight because you didn\u0026rsquo;t gain it quickly. According to the JAMA, just a modest amount of weight loss will improve your visceral fat stores and other medical complications you have. Use that as motivation to stick with your eating and exercise program. Step 4. Stop practicing unhealthy lifestyle habits. Stop smoking, drinking, being inactive, and eating high-fat, processed foods. Choosing healthier lifestyle choices will improve your quality of life and will show up in inches lost as stated in the Guidelines for Overweight and Obesity.",

    "LabBody": "Theo Albrecht Jr. and the heirs of his brother, Berthold, inherited one of the world's great retail fortunes, which grew from a corner grocery store in Essen, Germany, started in 1913. After World War II, their father, Theo Sr., along with his brother, Karl, took over the store and propagated the discount revolution in German retailing -- building their Aldi supermarket chain based on a no-frills, low-price strategy similar to Wal-Mart. In 1961, the brothers split ownership: Karl took the stores in southern Germany, plus the rights to the Aldi brand in the U.K., Australia and the U.S., while Theo Sr. got the stores in northern Germany and the rest of Europe. In 1971, Theo Sr. bought U.S. grocery discounter Trader Joe's. Together, Aldi Nord and Trader Joe's had estimated sales of around $40 billion in 2013. The businesses are owned through a family foundation set up by Theo Sr. after he was kidnapped for 17 days in 1971. Theo Sr. died in 2010, at the age of 88, and Karl died in 2014, at age 94. Like the family patriarchs, the Albrecht heirs maintain a decidedly low profile, and not much is known about them personally. Theo Jr. and his mother, Caecilie, sit on the board of trustees of the family foundation. More »",

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

    "DiffbotBody": "Would you run from a dinosaur in these shoes? From dinosaur theme parks to the red carpets of Cannes, everyone seems to be talking about high-heeled shoes. Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, has resigned from her post amid a cascading scandal over her handling of a massive breach of federal employee data. Archuleta, who has been at the helm of OPM since November 2013, submitted her resignation Friday morning. OPM announced Thursday that the size of a hack that began last year led to the pilfering of sensitive personal information of 21.5 million former and current employees. That admission, following weeks of scrutiny on Capitol Hill after OPM acknowledged a separate data breach that affected 4.2 million, led to a rush of lawmakers who called for her ousting, including the top three House Republicans and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. (RELATED: OPM Doesn't Know Who It Will Hire to Protect the 21.5 Million Individuals Affected by Hack) Officials have privately linked both data breaches to China. Beth Cobert, the deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget, will take over Archuleta's job on an interim basis. The OPM director position must be confirmed by the Senate, and the Obama administration will have to grapple with a Republican-controlled Congress that is deeply skeptical about the agency in order to approve a permanent replacement. \"Today I informed the OPM workforce that I am stepping down as the leader of this remarkable agency and the remarkable people who work for it,\" Archuleta said in a statement. \"This morning, I offered, and the President accepted, my resignation as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. I conveyed to the President that I believe it is best for me to step aside and allow new leadership to step in, enabling the agency to move beyond the current challenges and allowing the employees at OPM to continue their important work.\" (RELATED: OPM Announces More Than 21 Million Affected by Second Data Breach) White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that Archuleta offered her resignation \"of her own volition. \"That's precisely why the president accepted her resignation,\" Earnest said. The data breach compromised 19.7 million individuals' Social Security numbers, and the remainder of the affected individuals—1.8 million people—were family and friends. In addition to Social Security numbers, the stolen information included employment history, financial and health history, addresses, and even fingerprints. The hack announced Thursday occurred at roughly the same time as another hack, which OPM announced in June. That data breach affected 4.2 million current and former federal workers, 3.6 million of whom were also affected by the larger breach. Archuleta had remained resolute in the face of withering scrutiny, and the White House had expressed support for her as recently as Thursday. When asked on a press call if she would step down, Archuleta said \"no\" and credited her agency with improving its cybersecurity since she had taken over. \"It is because the efforts of OPM and its staff that we've been able to identify the breaches,\" Archuleta said. But on Friday, Earnest said the agency is in need of a change. \"It's quite clear that new leadership with a set of skills and experiences that are unique to the urgent challenges that OPM faces are badly needed. That accounts for the acting director that the president has appointed.\" Archuleta served as a national political director for President Obama's reelection campaign. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a GOP candidate for the White House, had taken to referring to her as a \"political hack\" who needed to be removed. Warner, who represents thousands of federal workers living in Northern Virginia, said Friday, \"This is the right move for the agency and all those affected by the breach.\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Archuleta's removal was the \"right decision, and one that will help to restore confidence in an agency that not only poorly defended sensitive data of millions of Americans but struggled to respond to repeated intrusions.\" \"This change in leadership is also an acknowledgement that we cannot simply place blame on the hackers, but need to take responsibility for the protection of personal information that is so obvious a target,\" Schiff added. Rep. Ted Lieu said in a statement after Archuleta's resignation that the OPM should not be in charge of storing background-check data. \"OPM was never designed to be an intelligence or national security agency,\" the California Democrat said. \"We should not be trying to fit a square into a round hole. That's why Congressman Steve Russell and I are working on legislation to move the security clearance system out of OPM.\" OPM said Thursday it would notify the 21.5 million individuals affected by the larger hack, and offer them at least three years of comprehensive credit monitoring and fraud-protection services at no cost. But the agency does not yet have a contractor in place to provide the services. This story has been updated. Rebecca Nelson contributed to this article.",

The data breach com­prom­ised 19.7 mil­lion in­di­vidu­als’ So­cial Se­cur­ity num­bers, and the re­mainder of the af­fected in­di­vidu­als””1.8 mil­lion people””were fam­ily and friends. In ad­di­tion to So­cial Se­cur­ity num­bers, the stolen in­form­a­tion in­cluded em­ploy­ment his­tory, fin­an­cial and health his­tory, ad­dresses, and even fin­ger­prints. The hack an­nounced Thursday oc­curred at roughly the same time as an­oth­er hack, which OPM an­nounced in June. That data breach af­fected 4.2 mil­lion cur­rent and former fed­er­al work­ers, 3.6 mil­lion of whom were also af­fected by the lar­ger breach. Archu­leta had re­mained res­ol­ute in the face of with­er­ing scru­tiny, and the White House had ex­pressed sup­port for her as re­cently as Thursday. When asked on a press call if she would step down, Archu­leta said “no” and cred­ited her agency with im­prov­ing its cy­ber­se­cur­ity since she had taken over. “It is be­cause the ef­forts of OPM and its staff that we’ve been able to identi­fy the breaches,” Archu­leta said. (RE­LATED: A Timeline of Gov­ern­ment Data Breaches) But on Fri­day, Earn­est said the agency is in need of a change. “It’s quite clear that new lead­er­ship with a set of skills and ex­per­i­ences that are unique to the ur­gent chal­lenges that OPM faces are badly needed. That ac­counts for the act­ing dir­ect­or that the pres­id­ent has ap­poin­ted.” Archu­leta served as a na­tion­al polit­ic­al dir­ect­or for Pres­id­ent Obama’s reelec­tion cam­paign. Former Flor­ida Gov. Jeb Bush, a GOP can­did­ate for the White House, had taken to re­fer­ring to her as a “polit­ic­al hack” who needed to be re­moved. Warner, who rep­res­ents thou­sands of fed­er­al work­ers liv­ing in North­ern Vir­gin­ia, said Fri­day, “This is the right move for the agency and all those af­fected by the breach.” Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Demo­crat on the House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee, said Archu­leta’s re­mov­al was the “right de­cision, and one that will help to re­store con­fid­ence in an agency that not only poorly de­fen­ded sens­it­ive data of mil­lions of Amer­ic­ans but struggled to re­spond to re­peated in­tru­sions.” “This change in lead­er­ship is also an ac­know­ledge­ment that we can­not simply place blame on the hack­ers, but need to take re­spons­ib­il­ity for the pro­tec­tion of per­son­al in­form­a­tion that is so ob­vi­ous a tar­get,” Schiff ad­ded. Rep. Ted Lieu said in a state­ment after Archu­leta’s resig­na­tion that the OPM should not be in charge of stor­ing back­ground-check data. “OPM was nev­er de­signed to be an in­tel­li­gence or na­tion­al se­cur­ity agency,” the Cali­for­nia Demo­crat said. “We should not be try­ing to fit a square in­to a round hole. That’s why Con­gress­man Steve Rus­sell and I are work­ing on le­gis­la­tion to move the se­cur­ity clear­ance sys­tem out of OPM.” OPM said Thursday it would no­ti­fy the 21.5 mil­lion in­di­vidu­als af­fected by the lar­ger hack, and of­fer them at least three years of com­pre­hens­ive cred­it mon­it­or­ing and fraud-pro­tec­tion ser­vices at no cost. But the agency does not yet have a con­tract­or in place to provide the ser­vices. This story has been up­dated. Rebecca Nelson contributed to this article.",

CNN rallied behind Gupta, saying he had the network's support and that it was proud of his or.Gupta has our \"full and unequivocal support,\" CNN said in a statement. \"As we reported, he assisted the surgeons at Bir Hospital by performing a craniotomy on a young victim,\" the network said.\"Some reporting has suggested it was not the young girl we, at the time of our own reporting in the midst of the crisis, believed her to be. We will try to verify that.\" It said Gupta had spent a week in Nepal, \"helped save a young life in the operating room, and we couldn't be prouder of him.\"Gupta's medical assistance, particularly in disaster zones, is sometimes shown on the network’s newscasts.CNN had provided video to Global Press Journal more than a week ago that showed Gupta's role in the surgery, contradicting the initial claim that he hadn't helped at all.\"He was, if anything, relatively modest on the air in characterising his own role. He simply appears to have been fundamentally wrong about the identity of his patient,\" said NPR's David Folkenflik, who was informed of the journal's reporting ahead of time.",

    "DiffbotBody": "MADISON — The Catapult thrill ride that malfunctioned just before it was to launch two riders through the air at the Mt. Olympus Water and Theme Park on Wednesday in Wisconsin Dells passed a recent safety inspection but has been cited for past violations, state inspection records show. A video of the malfunctioning ride showed that a mechanism anchoring the two elastic bands that propel the ride apparently broke down shortly after the riders were locked into their protective cage. The video went viral after it was posted on Facebook. The owners of the ride were told to remove it from the Mt. Olympus property Friday, according to theme park officials. The Catapult passed an inspection last month by an investigator for the state’s Department of Safety and Professional Services but its owner — Nashotah-based Casco — was cited in 2013 for failing to show any documentation that the ride’s wire rope and hoist operations were inspected by an independent third party, records from the Department of Safety and Professional Services showed. Investigators also could not find any documentation of current CPR or first aide certifications. The Catapult’s owner also was cited in 2011 for poor record keeping and was ordered to document and maintain records for daily and periodic inspections, any maintenance that was performed on the ride as well as training for the ride’s operators. An identical order was issued in 2011 for Apollo’s Swing, another ride owned by Casco that is still operational at Mt. Olympus, records show. Speed Rock, a third ride owned by Casco at Mt. Olympus, is no longer operational. In 2006, investigators found that its cables were not replaced annually as requested by its manufacturer and the Consumers Products Safety Commission, state records show. That same year, the Catapult’s operators were ordered by investigators to update their first-aid and CPR certifications, records showed. The owner of Casco was listed as Richard Clark of Nashotah. Clark did not return messages left at phone numbers registered to him and Casco. Online court records show that Casco has faced more than $15,000 in workers compensation penalty warrants and delinquent unemployment compensation and delinquent tax issues since 2002.

I mean, what could possibly be cuter than a couple of kittens curled up with each other on the couch? Think about a cat snuggled up with a new puppy in its dog bed... Or what about eight birds, a golden retriever, and a hamster all taking a nap together? This is Bob, a golden retriever from São Paulo, Brazil. He lives with his human, Luiz Higa Junior, eight birds... And a hamster. When Higa adopted Bob at four months old, he already had a parakeet and a cockatiel living with him. After seeing how well the three did together... He decided to add a couple more feathered friends to the family. The newest (and welcome) addition to the crew is that grey little lump on Bob's nose. The unlikely family has lots of fun together... Making sure to get plenty of sleep in between adventures. Sometimes the cockatiels might hog the dinner plate... But that's alright. Bob can pass the time with a quick nap with some of his other pals. Look at those smiles! Bob even helps his tinier pals with their workouts. They never miss an opportunity for a good photoshoot! Gang's all here in this one! Just hangin' out. They even play dead together! (via Rocket News 24) Be sure to follow this happy family on Instagram and Facebook.

Winston-Salem committed two errors in the top of the first, which led to the Nationals taking a 3-0 lead off Dash starter James Dykstra. The first two runs were scored with two outs and the bases loaded when catcher Omar Narvaez made an errant throw to third trying to pick off Narciso Mesa, and the third came on a double by John Wooten; all three runs were unearned. kAmQxE H2D 2 E@F89 H2J E@ DE2CE @77 E96 82\u003e6[Q s2D9 |2?286C %:\u003e tD\u003e2J D2:5] QqFE H6 H6C6 288C6DD:G6] x =:\u003c6 E92E ~\u003e2C W}2CG26KX H2D ECJ:?8 E@ A:4\u003c D@\u003e63@5J @77 H:E9 E96 32D6D =@2565] w6VD 5@?6 :E 7@C FD 2== J62C] %96 @FE H2D E96C6 E@ 36 925[ 3FE H6 ;FDE 5:5?VE 6I64FE6 E96 A=2J]Qk^Am kAm%96 s2D9 C6DA@?565 H:E9 EH@ CF?D @7 :ED @H? :?

    "DiffbotBody": "Scott Disick has cancelled a Las Vegas club appearance scheduled for Friday night. The 32-year-old pulled out of a stint at 1Oak a day before he was scheduled to appear, according to TMZ. It was set to be Scott's first public appearance since it was revealed that he has split from Kourtney Kardashian after nine years and three children together. Scroll down for video Scott posted a flyer for the event on his Instagram page on Tuesday, asking fans to 'come party' with him. He has since deleted it. The news comes on the same day it was claimed that the reality star went in and out of rehab in Florida on Sunday. Us Weekly reports that Scott spent just a few hours in the centre, which is believed to be near where he is staying with rumoured ex-girlfriend Chloe Bartoli. 'Come party with me': The reality star posted a flyer promoting his nightclub stint on Instagram on Wednesday, but he has since deleted it While photos of Scott looking very cosy with Chloe in France are thought to be what led to Kourtney ending their relationship, it has been claimed that his partying also contributed. It's unclear if the reality star cancelled his club appearance in a bid to show his ex-girlfriend that he is trying to reform his bad boy ways, or if he wants to avoid being grilled about the split on the red carpet. Kourtney and Scott have three children together, Mason, five, Penelope, who turned three on Wednesday, and six-month-old Reign. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star took Penelope to Disneyland for her third birthday, and Scott posted a forlorn message to his only daughter on Instagram. Along with a collage of photos of his little girl, he wrote: '1 of the only things I'm proud off [sic] about myself. Happybdayp.' On Thursday, TMZ claimed that Kourtney packed up Scott's belongings at their home and sent them to his bachelor pad in Beverly Hills. Although Scott appears to be sad about the end of his almost decade long relationship, he apparently is not necessarily convinced that it is over for good. 'Scott says that he's doing fine,' a source told People, adding that he is not taking the break-up seriously. 'He says that he is not upset that the relationship is over, because \"over\" doesn't always mean \"over.\" He has left open the door to getting back with her.' The insider added: 'But he's open to the idea that she may not forgive him and it may really be over for good, and he's okay with that, too. Right now his feeling is, whatever happens, happens.'",

Founded by Dieter's father, Josef, in 1930, Schwarz Group, with revenue of around $92 billion, is comprised of the Lidl and Kaufland store chains; the former is Germany's second-biggest discounter behind Aldi. Schwarz regularly appeared on Forbes' annual billionaires ranking in the 1990s but was taken off the list in 1999 after making the case to Forbes that he had transferred his ownership of Lidl to a charitable foundation. He returned to the list in 2013, after research showed that the Dieter Schwarz Foundation is a limited liability company with a charitable purpose, not a charitable foundation. Dividends are used to fund charitable projects, but Schwarz maintains full control over his shares and can sell them at any time. The Dieter Schwarz Foundation supports education and daycare facilities for children, science and research projects as well as other activities. In 2011, the Bildungscampus der Dieter Schwarz Stiftung opened in Heilbronn; the university campus, funded by the foundation, houses a graduate school of management and law as well as other higher education offerings. A decidedly private person who shuns all publicity, Schwarz has been married for over 50 years and has two daughters. More »",

It’s the first time since the early 1960s that the flag has been removed. After discussions in the House and the Senate earlier this week, the General Assembly had the required two-thirds vote to remove the flag. Gov. Nikki Haley signed legislation on Thursday that called for the flag to be removed and placed in the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum. Rep. Donna Hicks, R-Boiling Springs, was standing with Haley when the flag came down Friday. She described feeling mixed emotions. Hicks was glad to see the flag come down and said she was very proud of South Carolina. “Today, I am proud of South Carolina for taking that flag down and putting it in a museum where it honors our soldiers,” Hicks said. It never should have been placed on top of the Statehouse, she added. Taking it down and putting it in a museum honors the soldiers who fought under the flag, Hicks said. Rep. Harold Mitchell, Jr, D-Spartanburg, said he is glad the flag is down and feels good about that, but he pointed out the work that is ahead of legislators. During the lengthy House discussion on removal of the flag, numerous amendments were put up to kill the bill, Mitchell said. He felt like it was an attempt to push the removal bill to January when the regular session started again — a move that would have killed the bill. Mitchell said this process has allowed the public to see how the legislative body does business, and he isn’t necessarily sure it was a good thing. The process to remove the flag should have taken about two hours, Mitchell said. But dysfunction, childish behavior and arguments that dragged the debate on for more than 13 hours showed people why “we’re dead last in everything,” Mitchell said. “The flag is down, but now what? It’s not flying anymore but that same rebellious spirit displayed for the world to see is what we’ll have to address and deal with,” Mitchell said. “I think people can see how on one side the Senate moved things pretty rapidly with that bill and on the House side it was just childish behavior.” Removal of the flag wasn’t a popular idea with all of the Spartanburg County legislators. Rep. Bill Chumley, R-Woodruff, said it was a rash decision and happened too fast. The removal of the flag made more people angry than its placement did, Chumley said. Chumley and Sen. Lee Bright, R-Roebuck, both supported giving South Carolinians the opportunity to voice their opinions on removal. Had the people of the state had an opportunity to voice their opinions, Chumley said he felt like the issue could have been resolved. “We’ve attacked a symbol — something that wasn’t even the problem,” Chumley said. “We’ve solved nothing.” Bright, who has been a boisterous supporter of keeping the flag at the Statehouse, said its removal was heartbreaking for a lot of South Carolinians who felt like they were being punished for Dylann Roof’s actions. Roof is accused of the June 17 killings of nine people during a Bible study in a church in Charleston. It was taken down under an air of political correctness, Bright added, and called the flag’s removal an “emotional decision.” On many occasions, Bright has expressed his concern that the removal of the flag would give lawmakers the necessary steam to start removing other monuments, statues and even portraits of Confederate war heroes. Already, Bright said, there are legislators who have their eyes set on Tillman Hall, Tillman Statue and the Naval Jack flag at The Citadel. “This is far from over,” Bright said. “This is the Alamo. We lost a major, painful battle but the war has just begun.” Hicks said there have been no talks going forward about removing any other memorials or statues associated with the Confederacy. The flag needed to be removed because of the divisive purposes for which it became known for, but Hicks said she doesn’t support the removal of anything else. “For the family members of those nine, knowing that young man got his strength and marching orders from that flag, they realized it was a symbol of hate for them,” Hicks said. “We needed to remove that flag.” Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

    "DiffbotBody": "They say it is all in who you know, and this also applies to getting in front of investors. Typically investors, whether they are in a VC firm, part of an accelerator or incubator, or an angel investor, do not consider start-ups on a cold call basis. Investors tend to listen to other investors about potential companies to add to their portfolio in a similar way that a consumer will listen to their peer group about a new product, store, or restaurant. With peer power driving the investment potential of your start-up, you need to figure out how to get introduced to those investors who fund and fuel your space or business segment. Here are the steps you should take to ramp up the number of investors’ doors your foot is firmly planted in: Start within your own network to determine who you know and then research, both online and offline, who are within their networks. Online, you can most often see their connections on places like LinkedIn and other professional social networking sites. By doing this, you are actually creating a new network made up specifically of just introducers. Attend meet-ups, conferences, and pitch competitions where you know your network and these potential investors will be so you can get a chance at a more personal, one-on-one introduction. This way, you can also observe their body language and leverage your own interpersonal skills, knowledge, and prepared elevator pitch to make the most of the introduction. Although a typical VC does not go to conferences with the idea of meeting new investments, an introduction by another investor while attending the conference or meet-up can still have a positive impact. Specifically ask a friend or colleague to introduce you to a certain investor you have your eye on after your research. You might even compose an email your friend can send on your behalf so they create the connection for you. It needs to be concise and contain everything you want to tell them within the body of the email. Your friend is most likely already sold on your start-up, so focus on making an effective e-mail message. With friends, also do not take advantage by asking for a list of introductions. Instead, focus on two or three really important introductions they can help you make. Ask a fellow entrepreneur. Even if you do not consider an entrepreneur a personal friend but you run in similar circles, it does not hurt to reach out and ask them for an investor introduction. Often, those entrepreneurs were once like you and were seeking their own introductions. In the same spirit, many are then willing to help others in that same boat. While this helps you, the entrepreneur also gets a nod of appreciation from the investor who is most likely looking for new opportunities and likes being connected to a likely viable business idea. Just be sure to really sell your idea to the entrepreneur so he feels excited and passionate about creating that introduction to an investor on your behalf. When your start-up takes off, make sure to pay it forward and help out others that could value from your new connector status. Ask those early investors for an investor introduction, if you already have some funding. Like creating those social media brand advocates that preach the word about companies and products, these early investors can also fervently share their enthusiasm with other investors and create an introduction that can help with something they see is missing – whether that is additional funding or segment experience or connections. “An investor will listen to an investor, and likely already knows what it is like to work with them. The trust and working relationship is established so that introduction may just be what solidifies a great opportunity.” Manny Fernandez Founder of DreamFunded. Keep a database of who you would like to be introduced to, as well as who can introduce you, and whether or not you have been introduced with notes about the results. Once you start getting a pipeline of potential introductions, you want to stay on top of them so you do not begin to confuse investors and ruin your chance at a connection because you did not pay attention to the details. Let the person who did the introducing know how it went, as they likely want to know if it paid off for you or if there is anything else they can do. This will help nurture what can be a long-term relationship that offers value to the both of you. It is still good business practice to be polite. Any connectors that you are turning to would also appreciate any updates in how your start-up is proceeding in terms of news and successes, which may help trigger other ideas for investor introductions. They may have also been hesitating to introduce you to someone, but hearing that you are progressing may change their mind. While this is a list of Do’s when it comes to how to get introduced to investors, there is one major Don’t, which is do not ask others to identify investors on your behalf or do all the work. You must do your own research and come prepared with information that fits those investors. With that in hand, using these avenues to get introduced is a major step toward getting funding. Andrea Zurek Founding Partner, XG Ventures said “Be able to talk about your company and it’s product in one or two sentences. Be conscientious of the investor’s time. Most investors will ask for a presentation deck, but you should be able to distill your company’s value proposition in an attention getting phrase(s) – short, to the point. Answer the so what? What does it mean for me the consumer? What does it mean for me as an investor? Will the product solve something that no one else is doing or better? Don’t be the next “uber” or “dropbox” of “x” or “y.” Your product/company should stand on its own merits. What’s your plan to ramp the company, get customers, do you have an exit strategy? In other words, have a well thought out plan and walk the investor through that logic train.” After the door of opportunity is opened, it is up to you to have your pitch prepared.",

    "LabBody": "http://www.chron.com/news/education/article/What-rich-kids-like-to-study-in-college-6373470.php. A study by a Cornell sociologist showed that the children of more affluent parents frequently pick majors in college that might not yield lucrative careers. Sociologist Kim Weeden looked at data from National Center for Education Statistics and determined that wealthy kids major in English. Or history. Or the visual and performing arts. Students from lower-income families study more pragmatic subjects like computer science, medicine, nursing and education. The reason for this result might not simply be that rich kids get to be more whimsical with what they study in college. Different types of schools also offer different majors. From The Atlantic: Most of the priciest, top-tier schools don’t offer Law Enforcement as a major, for instance. There is also the possibility that children from higher-income families were more exposed to the sorts of art, music, and literature that colleges deem worthy of study, an exposure that might inspire them to pursue those subjects when they get to college. See the gallery to learn to which majors correlate with big paychecks for that student’s parents.",

    "LabBody": "Sure, Bill Murray has done his fair share of hilariously random and weird things. But in addition to having a killer sense of humor, the actor is pretty deep—as these quotes show. 1. ON WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE BILL MURRAY, PART ONE. “Nothing prepared me for being this awesome. It's kind of a shock. It's kind of a shock to wake up every morning and be bathed in this purple light.” — From a 2014 Reddit AMA. 2. ON WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE BILL MURRAY, PART TWO. “There's a wonderful sense of well-being that begins to circulate . . . up and down your spine. And you feel something that makes you almost want to smile. So what's it like to be me? Ask yourself, ‘What's it like to be me?’ The only way we'll ever know what it's like to be you is if you work your best at being you as often as you can, and keep reminding yourself that's where home is.” — From a 2014 Q\u0026A during Canada’s Bill Murray Day, via Rolling Stone. 3. ON HOW HE LIVES HIS LIFE. “I live a little bit on the seat of my pants, I try to be alert and available ... for life to happen to me. We’re in this life, and if you’re not available, the sort of ordinary time goes past and you didn’t live it. But if you’re available, life gets huge. You’re really living it.” — From an interview with Charlie Rose, via Flavorwire. 4. ON BEING RELAXED. “The more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything: the better you are with your loved ones, the better you are with your enemies, the better you are at your job, the better you are with yourself.” — From a 2012 interview with The New York Times. 5. ON BEING AN ACTOR. “I don't believe that you can give the same performance every take. It's physically impossible, so why bother? If you don't do what is happening at that moment, then it's not real. Then you're holding something back.” — From a 1984 interview with Rolling Stone. 6. ON MARRIAGE. “If you have someone that you think is The One, don't just sort of think in your ordinary mind, ‘OK, let's pick a date. Let's plan this and make a party and get married.’ Take that person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all around the world, and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if, when you come back to JFK ... you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.” — From an impromptu speech at a stranger’s bachelor party, via Huffington Post 7. ON HIS INTERACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. “My hope, always, is that it's going to wake me up. I'm only connected for seconds, minutes a day, sometimes. And suddenly, you go, ‘Holy cow, I've been asleep for two days. I've been doing things, but I'm just out.’ If I see someone who's out cold on their feet, I'm going to try to wake that person up. It's what I'd want someone to do for me. Wake me the hell up and come back to the planet.” — From a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone 8. ON ACTING CLASS VS. LIVE IMPROV. “If you go to actors' class, you don't really die, because there's never really an audience. But if you work for Second City, there's an audience, and you die in the improv set five times out of nine. So, once you get over your fear of dying, nothing else ever really scares you. And Saturday Night Live was as tough as Second City. Once you get through those, making movies is a joke.” — From a 1990 interview with Roger Ebert. 9. ON SEINFELD. “I never had seen Seinfeld, and they said, ‘Oh, it’s the last episode.’ And I said, ‘Oh, I’ll watch Seinfeld.’ And it was terrible.” — From a 2014 interview with Howard Stern. 10. ON WHEN FAME IS A GOOD THING. “There's only a couple times when fame is ever helpful. Sometimes you can get into a restaurant where the kitchen is just closing. Sometimes you can avoid a traffic violation. But the only time it really matters is in the emergency room with your kids. That's when you want to be noticed, because it's very easy to get forgotten in an ER. It's the only time when I would ever say, ‘Thank God. Thank God.’ There's no other time.” — From a 2012 interview with Esquire. 11. ON HIS NOTORIOUS INACCESSIBILITY. “A moat can be a pretty good thing. It can be lovely. It keeps rodents away from the castle. It can have fish in it. Even fish that talk. … If you give people access, they take advantage. My phone would ring 75 times in a row. Finally, I would pick it up and say, ‘Who the hell is this?’ ‘Oh, hi! I’m calling from so-and-so’s office…’ What kind of person would ever, ever let the phone ring 75 times? And I guess that’s when I started thinking: ­I can do without these people.” — From a 2013 interview with TimeOut London. 12. ON BEING AN ARTIST. “It's hard to be an artist. It's hard to be anything. It's hard to be.” — From a 2014 interview with The Independent. 13. ON HIS FATHERING TIPS. “If you bite on everything they throw at you, they will grind you down. You have to ignore a certain amount of stuff. The thing I keep saying to them lately is: ‘I have to love you, and I have the right to ignore you.’ When my kids ask what I want for my birthday or Christmas or whatever, I use the same answer my father did: ‘Peace and quiet.’ That was never a satisfactory answer to me as a kid—I wanted an answer like ‘A pipe.’ But now I see the wisdom of it: All I want is you at your best—you making this an easier home to live in, you thinking of others.” — From a 2012 interview with Esquire. 14. ON PREPARING FOR HIS ROLES. “I’m not that organized. I’m not one of those guys. I mean you read it, you look at it, and you go: I have that in me, I can do that. I don’t necessarily get all mental. There are people that are working with you on every level and on a movie you’re working with people that are, ideally, all serving the same goal and that’s what helps me get into a role.” — From an interview with The Talks. 15. ON HIS MOTHER. “My mother is a real character, a talkative soul who can make friends with anyone, and she'd always been a massive influence on me. She's so animated, I even used to tape phone conversations with her in order to steal material!” — From a 1988 interview with The New York Times. 16. ON MAKING MOVIES. “[I]t's an amazing triumph even to make a bad movie. Even a crap film is really an extraordinary achievement. You're taking a two-dimensional object and making it three-dimensional. The number of people. The number of days. The number of cuts.” — From a 2012 interview with Esquire. 17. ON GILDA RADNER. “Gilda was a fantastic laugher. I never enjoyed making anyone laugh more than her. I remember one day, I made her laugh so hard, she thought she was going to die. And I just couldn’t stop. I used to be really funny, and in those days I used to have almost like a vengeful thing; I could go for a long period of time and try to be funny. I don’t do it like I used to. And I miss that. I’m still funny, but back then I would take something and not let go of it.” — From Live in New York, via Vanity Fair. 18. ON SENTIMENTALITY. “Sentimentality to me is a symbol that we've left the planet. OK, bye-bye. Let me know when you come back because you're no longer here. You just left. It reminds of being at a funeral, like my dad dies and the grief is just overpowering. And all anyone can say to you is, ‘Well, he's probably up there in heaven, bowling with Uncle George.’ It's like, ‘Yeah, that's probably it. He's up there bowling with Uncle George.’ He's dead. He's gone. What am I going to do? Talk to ME. Don't make up your own dreamscape. Stay here with me, will you? Don't go away.” — From a 2014 interview with The New York Times. 19. ON PREPARING TO PLAY FDR. “I’ve always tried to be a little bit loose. This great director we had at Second City [Del Close] said: ‘You wear your characters like a trench coat. It’s still you in there, but there’s like a trench coat.’ So I figured this was like a winter trench coat, because there was just a little bit more character that comes to the party. So I did a lot more reading, a lot more studying.” — From a 2012 interview with The New York Times. 20. ON SAYING NO. “It’s extremely powerful to say no; it’s really the most powerful thing to say.” — From a 2012 interview with the Washington Post. 21. ON FAILURE. “Don't think about your errors or failures, otherwise you'll never do a thing.” — From a 2005 interview with The Guardian. 22. ON HOW TO LIVE LIFE. “As I once said to one of my brothers, ‘This is your life, not a rehearsal.’ Somewhere there’s a score being kept, so you have an obligation to live life as well as you can, be as engaged as you can. The human condition means that we can zone out and forget what the hell we’re doing. So the secret is to have a sense of yourself, your real self, your unique self. And not just once in a while, or once a day, but all through the day, the week and life. You know what they say: ‘Ain’t no try, ain’t nothing to it but to do it.’” — From a 2013 interview with TimeOut London.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Get cozy, stargazers. The Cancer sun rules the skies until July 22, putting us on a friends-and-family plan. In between picnics and OITNB marathons, make time for some cuddling — of the romantic variety. Amorous Venus travels alongside adventurous Jupiter until the 18th, supersizing our desires. Vacation romances, cross-cultural connections, and even long-distance relationships could be our new normal. Venus turns retrograde from July 25 to September 6, which could bring some blasts from the past. If an ex sends a Snapchat, think twice before you open it. If you’re getting married while Venus is in reverse, it’s always wise to do a vow renewal on your first anniversary — just for certainty’s sake. July is bookended by two full moons, helping us start and end the month on a productive note. On the 1st, the full moon in Capricorn brings out the movers and shakers in us all. Embrace the team spirit when the Aquarius full moon lights up the night skies on the 31st.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Pope Francis is finishing the second leg of his Latin American trip in Bolivia, and is now boarding the plane to go to Paraguay. Last night was the big speech of his trip. He managed to tie together both a historic apology to his fellow Latin Americans about the Roman Catholic Church’s role in the abuses of the colonial era and position the church as an agent against what he called a \"new colonialism.\" This has landed with a bang in Latin America, but also in the rest of the world. This speech in Bolivia will make his September trip to the United States very interesting. His attack on the global economic system could be read as a stern critique of some aspects of American capitalism. Francis remains difficult to define. He doesn’t appear to be the sort of radical leftist like President Evo Morales of Bolivia. There were some moments on this trip that seemed to catch him off guard, like when Mr. Morales gave him a cross shaped like a hammer and sickle. The pope smiled and seemed to hand it off as quickly as he could. Pope Francis is back at the Vatican, after an eight-day tour of Latin America in which he seemed to accomplish his goals for the trip. His big speech in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was the defining thematic moment, as he twinned a historic apology for the Roman Catholic Church’s complicity in Spanish colonialism in Latin America with a blunt criticism of a “new colonialism” at a global level, rooted in materialism, inequality and a profit mentality. He attracted huge, enthusiastic crowds and received blanket media coverage in the countries he visited, Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. And yet the pope, an Argentine, also showed little interest in involving himself too deeply in the political squabbles of his home continent. He preached unity and refrained from directly scolding political leaders, or wading into sensitive issues, such as freedom of expression in Ecuador, even when activists in some countries were eager for him to do so. Perhaps environmentalists will be the happiest, since he regularly expressed, in broad terms, his message of fighting ecological degradation and climate change. The focus will now shift to Francis’ September trip to Cuba and the United States. On Sunday night, as his papal jetliner was returning to Rome, Francis signaled that he knew his economic message was already facing criticism in the United States and pledged to study it. Some critics blame him for rebuking capitalism with an unduly broad brush. Others say he ignores that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. This is one reason the visit to the United States is likely to be more complicated for Francis, even as he is certain to attract large crowds and a warm welcome. A NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll in April showed that 55 percent of Americans have a positive view of the pope, compared with only 6 percent who have a negative view. Any politician would dream of those numbers. I’m planning to travel with Francis again in September and am looking forward to reporting on the trip up close. He will speak before Congress and at the United Nations, so on the biggest stages. It should be a lot of fun. Many thanks to everyone who followed this notebook, or who kept up on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Thanks again. It was great fun. Before we boarded the papal airline on Sunday for the long flight back to Rome, the debate had begun: What questions would we ask the pope? And who would ask them? Pope Francis has made it a tradition to hold a mid-air news conference on the return trip of any of his international flights. For reporters, it is our chance to directly question the pope on tough issues and see how he responds. First, though, comes a process. The traveling press pool is too big for everyone to ask a question, yet it is too diverse to allow only one or two journalists to handle the job. First dibs always go to reporters from the countries visited during the trip. A reporter from each country can ask a question, in this case, from Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. Then it gets trickier. Groups are divided by language. Journalist from Spanish-speaking countries cluster together, as do the Italians, the English speakers and other Europeans. Within groups, reporters discuss, debate and argue about which questions to ask; then they discuss, debate and argue about how to phrase the questions; and then they discuss, debate and argue about who gets to ask the question. This time there was also discussion, debate and argument about what language would be used to ask the questions. Usually, it is Italian, but with so many Spanish speakers on board, the decision was to do both (which makes translating things trickier). The main goal is to elicit an answer from Francis that makes news. During his first on-flight press conference, Francis was asked about homosexuals and famously responded, \"Who am I to judge?\" On another flight, he confirmed his belief that mankind is at least partly responsible for climate change. This time, we in the English-language group want him to discuss his remarks about capitalism. We want to know if he is attacking the American way of life. Update: Just landed in Rome. Interesting press conference. By mutual consent, we are embargoing our stories until 4 p.m. CEST. Take a look very soon. Update: Here's my article on the news conference aboard the papal airplane.",
    "LabBody": "On Tuesday night, I was crawling into bed, exhausted, when I checked my Twitter feed and noticed a post, with photographs, addressed to me. Protesters were holding candles and waving Ecuadorean flags in the photos. happening now at the Hotel entrance. Ecuadorian Journalist for PressFreedom PLS Listen. I sighed. My hotel bed was comfortable. Maybe this was just a prank. I got dressed, took the elevator to the lobby and checked the front door. Nothing. Inside the expansive media center provided for reporters traveling with Pope Francis, desserts were arrayed on a table. Several journalists were still filing stories. Normal. Another hotel entrance was nearby, but a security officer had blocked it by erecting a temporary wall decorated with images of Francis. Odd. I wiggled around the wall but saw nothing suspicious. I sent a response on Twitter from the lobby and returned to my room: just walked downstairs but didn’t see anyone. I got back in bed and made another final check of my phone. Another Twitter message awaited, this one with a photo showing the wall I had wiggled around. I hadn’t looked hard enough. The journalists about 80 are on the street. MainEntrance. Clothes back on, down the elevator again, this time with genuine curiosity. Outside the hotel, I found five people holding one Ecuadorean flag, the stragglers from the larger rally in the original photograph. I told them social media must still be free, given how they had tracked me down. They laughed. “Social media is the only freedom that we still have,” said Maria-Laura Patiño, one of the group. With the world’s media at their doorstep, they had staged a small demonstration outside our hotel to draw attention to one of the ironies of Francis' trip to Ecuador. Even as the government has treated us like visiting dignitaries, journalists in Ecuador are under intense pressure. Ecuador’s Constitution provides freedom of expression, but civil society leaders say the reality is far different, as newspapers and journalists critical of the government of President Rafael Correa can face legal prosecution and other pressures. “We are just citizens,” Isabel Proano told me, “and we wanted to bring attention to the issue of freedom of expression – which we had none of.” We talked for a while and they wandered home, as I returned to my room and flipped open my laptop to search \"Ecuador\" and \"freedom of expression.\" I had known that the Correa government had been criticized for quashing dissent, but the search results were revealing. Freedom House, the global watchdog organization that ranks countries on freedom of expression, rated Ecuador this year as \"not free\". It accused Mr. Correa and other political leaders of creating a hostile environment for the media, and using a 2013 communications law as a tool to intimidate and legally sanction critics in the media. Mr. Correa also has filed several criminal and civil defamation cases against critical journalists. Next, I found a news release by the Committee to Protect Journalists, dated June 16, barely three weeks before Francis arrived. It described how Ecuador’s state media oversight commission had fined an independent daily newspaper, El Universo, about $350,000. Why? In March, El Universo published an exposé alleging problems at state-run hospitals. Journalists attempted to interview the government official in charge but got no reply. The day after the story was published, Mr. Correa criticized it on Twitter, arguing it had failed to allow a government response. Doing so, under Ecuadorean law, is punishable. A government minister ordered El Universo to publish the state's long rebuttal. The newspaper complied, but wrote its own headlines and did not publish government-drafted summaries that claimed the original story was designed to trick readers. Boom. A $350,000 fine. You can find example after example if you keep searching. I was reminded of one of the inevitable compromises of being inside any traveling media bubble. You go through a country, but you are not really in it. The traveling papal media gets trays of empanadas and sliced fruit. The locals get fined.",

You just want to shout it from the rooftops and let everyone know the good news! For couples with a little extra time on their hands, making a video to share with loved ones and cherish forever can be a great way to announce the new addition. We recently saw this epic Britney Spears parody by the Green family go viral. For a ’90s teen like me, this was about as good as it could get…until I came across this next video from YouTube vloggers The Murrays. This has to be the cutest parody I’ve ever seen in my life! It won me over before I even watched, because I love Walk The Moon’s hit song “Shut Up and Dance With Me,” but just when I was really enjoying it, their good news got even better. When Jon Murray and his wife Danielle found out they were pregnant with their fourth child their family was beyond happy, but then Jon’s brother Aaron Murray and his wife Liz found out some good news of their own! These little babies are going to be so lucky to have each other…and such a fun, happy and loving family. Did you love this awesome double pregnancy announcement? Please SHARE this video on Facebook, so all of your friends can enjoy, too!",

Then, in the entree round, with less than a minute remaining, one of the chefs has yet to get one of the mystery ingredients on the plates! The judges watch on the edge of their seats to see if the competitor will remember before time runs out. When the two finalists find frozen pancakes in the final basket, whose dessert will stack up to a $10,000 victory? It's a night owls' nosh-fest, when the chefs learn that they will be preparing decadent dishes best enjoyed in the late-night hours. For the first course, the chefs must work with a carb-heavy Canadian snack and an Italian sausage. In the entree round, the chefs find themselves taking apart tiny burgers in an effort to creatively transform a midnight snack. Things get really \"loco\" in the dessert round with burritos in the basket. In the first round, the Grill Masters find grilling classics hot dogs and hamburgers in the same basket. Rack of elk is a welcome ingredient in the second basket, but the 30-minute time limit presents some issues. And the final two chefs have high hopes for what they can accomplish in the dessert round featuring chocolate cupcakes. The chefs open the appetizer basket to find vegan franks and three other meatless ingredients and have to work frantically to compose appetizers in 20 minutes. Then in the entree round, the judges wonder if one chef's strange decision about what to throw into the blender will be a blunder or a surprise success.

    "DiffbotBody": "JAKARTA, Indonesia—Change in wind direction allowed the airports in Bali and the neighboring island of Lombok to resume operations on Saturday after drifting volcanic ash forced authorities to shut down the airports two days ago. “The Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali has been reopened,” said Transportation Ministry spokesman Adravida Barata. Authorities had kept the airports closed early Saturday due to a new volcanic eruption of Mount Raung, in East Java, on Friday. Mount Raung, which first erupted earlier this month, is about 150 kilometers (94 miles) west of Bali. Hundreds flights in and out of the two Indonesian resort islands had been canceled since Thursday evening, stranding passengers and disrupting local businesses at the peak of the summer holiday season. Bali airport normally handles about 48,000 passengers daily, while Lombok airport serves about 3,600. The two island’s economies are heavily dependent on tourism, a sector the Indonesian government is relying on to bring foreign exchange into the country amid a slump in its commodity-heavy exports. Indonesia is home to dozens of active volcanoes that sit along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanic eruptions sometimes disrupt flights in the country, but have never been linked to aviation accidents.",

    "DiffbotBody": "When Vecernji list saw a need — that readers wanted a venue to run and walk for exercise — the news media company started its own school, the “GoOUT School of Movement.” Here are seven lessons learned from this profitable initiative. At Vecernji, we have directed all of our thoughts to creating new revenue streams in the last several years. We are trying to create a community of fans around our niche media platforms (print and digital platforms) by producing relevant and useful content, which will support and participate in our non-publishing projects. The growing trend among all generations to participate in outdoor activities encouraged us to launch a niche bi-monthly magazine GoOUT and accompanying digital platform 18 months ago, since publishing is still our core business. Analysing the needs of people, we concluded that across all age groups they are most interested in running/jogging and in Nordic walking for the 50+ age group. At the same time, a market analysis showed that sufficient capacity does not exist in clubs or schools to absorb all of this interest. These findings led us to an idea to establish our school, at first only in the capital city of Croatia. That is how the “GoOUT School of Movement” originated as a logical complement to the previously mentioned media platforms. After the initial idea, about which everyone been very enthusiastic (after everyday stresses, most of us the best relaxation finds in running), we were faced with several challenges. We didn’t know anything about organising this kind of school. We didn’t have professional trainers. We didn’t have a location or permits. And, most importantly, we didn’t have an allocated budget. We had to go one step at a time. Initial business plan been made and we found that project could be mostly financed from monthly memberships and the sponsorship of related companies that were interested in reaching this target group/community. For professional assistance, we turned to the Faculty of Kinesiology, with which we reached an agreement in a very short time (much to our very great surprise) – five trainers for the running school and seven trainers for the Nordic walking school. The next step was to select a location and obtain a permit. We selected four locations, in consultation with the professional team of trainers, we designed the programms. Since the programmes involved running and walking, several training programmes for different weight classes, age groups and physical capabilities were set up. Babysitting would be provided in the morning and afternoon periods at two locations for the children of parents who were running or walking. This service was a unique offer on the market because no other school had it. We completed all of these preparations in 30 days and were ready to launch our sales effort! We simultaneously started sales to future attendees, exclusively using for promotion all of the media platforms of our house with BTL (below-the-line) activities at the locations — open houses and test trainings —nd to our potential sponsors (multi-vitamin drinks, sportswear, shoes, gadgets, vitamins, etc.). That was in September 2014. The goal was to start the school in November. We knew that it wasn’t the best time of year for outdoor activities, but we still decided to start (if we could get the required money from sponsors and enough potential participants) and to introduce the project by the spring of 2015, when the peak season begins. In the first wave, we concluded two-year contracts with two main sponsors and we started the school with a 130 attendees, who trained three times a week divided into seven groups and different time periods. In this way we ensured a satisfactory profit after covering the project costs (trainers, baby sitting, T-shirts for the attendees, etc.). Today, the school has around 400 attendees and 21 groups, and our profit margin is growing month by month. In addition to the regular trainings, we have also organised two running races and two Nordic walking excursions in the mountains, open to anyone who is interested. Revenues from the registration fees for these events and the revenues from smaller/one-time sponsors are “icing on the cake” within P\u0026L. We can now safely our project is a success — with a current profit margin is 60%. At a time when all media companies, or at least a majority of them, are faced with a constant decline in classic revenues, we have learned that a good project without an allocated budget can still be launched and create extra profit for a company. For us, the definition of a good project means several things: To create a community of readers by quality content around niche media platforms. To recognise the needs of that community and to find empty space on the market. To create additional services or products that satisfy those needs an charge them. To maximise existing resources and to gather a team (project management, marketing, sales) to launch and implement a project that believes in its success. To constantly add new elements to a project that will in the long term keep the existing users and attract new ones. To create unique environment for potential sponsors based on the needs of the target group. To optimise costs and for promotion to use only our own media platforms if the portfolio provides sufficient reach, as in our case. (Small niche publishers can try to link up with larger media companies on a revenue-sharing principle in exchange for media space). Preparations for the next season have already begun. We will organise even more extra events, and the school can perhaps start to operate in other larger cities across the country. We are certain that new successes are coming!

    "DiffbotBody": "A key figure in Israel’s government has dismayed tens of thousands of fellow citizens and risked offending millions of the country’s supporters worldwide by calling into question whether they are properly Jewish. Comments by the country’s ultra-Orthodox Minister of Religious Affairs about followers of Judaism’s most liberal stream, the Reform Movement, inflamed a bitter dispute, with reverberations in Britain and the US. The minister, David Azoulay, told Army Radio that his view on a Reform Jew was that “from the moment he stops following Jewish law, I cannot allow myself to say he is a Jew”. He added: “These are Jews who have lost their way and we must ensure that every Jew returns to the fold of Judaism, and accept everyone with love and joy.” Read more: Ethiopian Jews: Israel 'racist from bottom up' Cameron: Israel was right to defend itself over Gaza UK arming Israel despite fear weapons will be used against Gaza The ultra-Orthodox Shas party, of which Mr Azoulay is a member, joined the right-wing, Likud-led coalition in May after Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, won this year’s election. It was not his first attack on Reform Judaism, which is seen by many in Israel, including those who are not religiously observant, as a departure from authentic Judaism. In June, he termed Reform Jews a “disaster to the nation of Israel”. Mr Azoulay was swiftly rebuked by Mr Netanyahu who, according to his spokesman, told him that “Israel is the homeland of all Jews – Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and everyone – and that he totally rejects any attempt to delegitimise part of the community.” Despite suggestions that he should be dismissed Mr Azoulay remains in his post. Gilad Kariv, a rabbi and executive director of the Reform Movement in Israel, said: “He can’t continue. He can’t be a minister in charge while he is not willing to carry out his duties towards all citizens of the state.” The movement has about two million adherents in 40 countries; many live in the US. But in Israel, Reform Jews make up much less than 1 per cent of the population, compared with the 10 per cent who are ultra-Orthodox. The new government, as a result of ultra-Orthodox influence, is rolling back moves made under the previous government to end the exemption of ultra-Orthodox Jews from compulsory military service. This rollback is part of the coalition agreement between Shas and Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party. Mr Azoulay’s said his comments had been taken out of context, and that Judaism taught that a Jew who sins is still a Jew. But he added, according to media reports, that Reform Judaism constituted “the biggest danger” to the Jewish people. At the same time another ultra-Orthodox politician, Moshe Gafni of the United Torah Judaism party, a coalition partner, also launched an attack, saying Reform Jews “stab the Holy Torah [Jewish bible] in the back”. The comments reinforced frustration among Reform leaders in Israel and abroad about the movement’s inferior official standing in the Jewish state compared with Orthodoxy. The Reform movement, which drops adherence to the letter of strict Jewish law in favour of a more modern approach, has a smaller following than Orthodox Judaism in the UK, but it is the largest American Jewish denomination. Mr Azoulay’s remarks were seen as particularly galling because of his responsibility for providing religious services to all Israelis. “It is disgraceful, and not the right approach for a politician who is a minister in charge of religious affairs, but it is what happens when you put a religious fundamentalist in charge,” said Rabbi Neil Janes of the West London synagogue, the flagship Reform synagogue in the UK. Rabbi Janes said his community “has thousands of people affected by these comments” and that Mr Netanyahu should “react strongly to ministers who have decided they no longer count”. Orthodoxy has enjoyed a monopoly over Jewish religious affairs in the Holy Land dating back to the British mandate in Palestine, when British authorities recognised an Orthodox chief rabbi. After the Israeli state was established in 1948, David Ben Gurion, the Prime Minister, included the ultra-Orthodox in his coalition and the monopoly was maintained. But even when the ultra-Orthodox were outside the coalition, Israel’s leaders have refrained from according recognition to Reform and Conservative Judaism. This rejection reflects the perception of many Israeli Jews, even the non-observant, that the Reform branch is “not authentic” because it broke with tradition while Orthodox Judaism, in their view, comprises those who stayed loyal to it. “The underlying approach of many Israelis is that the true Jews are the Orthodox and the ultra-Orthodox,” said Kimmy Caplan, a specialist in Jewish history at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv. Under current Israeli law, wedding ceremonies by Reform rabbis have no legal standing and Jewish couples can only be married by Orthodox rabbis. Likewise, conversions to Judaism conducted by Reform rabbis are deemed invalid. Reform congregations also find it more difficult to receive land allocations to build synagogues. “On the one hand the Prime Minister speaks against the incitement of Azoulay, but on the other he strengthens the Orthodox monopoly that sends Azoulay to speak for it,” said Mr Kariv. “Government policies signal that even if we are not outside of the Jewish faith, definitely the state of Israel sees us as second-class Jews.” But a government official, who asked for anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, said: “Over the last few years there has been movement and momentum for Reform Jews in Israel. The Prime Minister has said more than once he wants them to feel at home in Israel.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "If supermarket sales are a trustworthy barometer of the eating habits of the nation, it’s no wonder that blackcurrants are known as the “forgotten fruit”, as Whittern Farms grower Jo Hilditch, chair of the British Blackcurrant Foundation, describes them. Of the five national supermarkets asked for their thoughts on them, only one – M\u0026S – can find anything it wants to share with The Independent about these small, sharp-tasting berries, whose season typically runs from early July for four to six weeks. “Where everyone who had a garden used to have a blackcurrant bush as part of their self-sufficiency, now they have become one of the least common fruits,” explains Hilditch, who plants blackcurrants on her Herefordshire farm, as her grandmother did in the early 1900s. “I want to remind people, and bring them back into people’s kitchens, whether through juices, in yoghurts, from frozen, just anyhow!” We’re well acquainted with blackcurrants made into juice. Hilditch makes a fancy British Cassis, but the majority of the 350 or so tonnes picked each year goes – you guessed it – into bottles of Ribena, the end of the road for 95 per cent of the UK blackcurrant crop. The original formula, as an unbranded blackcurrant cordial, was distributed to children during the Second World War to supplement vitamin C levels. This evolved into Ribena, and it was marketed as a healthy product until the 2000s, when questions were raised about the levels of sugar, vitamin C and actual fruit in the drink. It lost most of its health credentials as a result. The fruit itself, however, has held on tightly to all of its nutrients, packing them densely within its glossy deep purple skin. Blackcurrants have been hailed as a homegrown superfood, with no air miles or expensive extraction to worry about. In fact, Hilditch set up the Blackcurrant Foundation to raise awareness of the fruit’s great nutritional benefits, as well as broadening their appeal in the kitchen. “They have four times more vitamin C in them than oranges, weight for weight,” she points out. “Blackcurrants have the best antioxidant polyphenols, particularly anthocyanins, which, in research, have been shown to help in maintaining cardiovascular health, ageing and brain health, urinary tract health and healthy vision.” Healthy or otherwise, Hilditch loves Ribena and wouldn’t be without a bottle. But where else can we use the currants? Elspeth Biltoft, who makes home-made Rosebud Preserves in Masham, North Yorkshire, says that blackcurrants are a gift to jam-makers because of their sharp-sweet flavour. “They have the right levels of naturally occurring pectin and acid,” she says. “I’ve never understood why blackcurrant jam is less popular than strawberry, raspberry and apricot.” Biltoft has made blackcurrant jam since she started out 26 years ago, and likes her fruit a very dark colour and tart to taste. Too ripe, she says, and you lose that unique flavour that makes blackcurrants so special. Jams aside, her top tip is to use redcurrants and blackcurrants in a summer pudding, along with strawberries and raspberries, packed into a pudding basin lined with a good white loaf. Adam Handling, head chef at Westminster restaurant Adam Handling at Caxton’s and Scottish Chef of the Year 2015, also likes to bring the sharpness to a sweet dish, using it with high-quality dark chocolate. “I have a dessert that includes a blackcurrant gel and ice cream to complement rich chocolate truffle and chocolate shortbread,” he says. “The blackcurrants provide a slight acidity, which balances the decadence of the chocolate.” Kirsty Hale, who writes Riverford Organic Farm’s recipes, makes the most of blackcurrants when they’re available, and freezes them for the rest of the year. They can add a hit to a rice pudding or clafoutis, she suggests, and matches them with elderflower jelly, a lemon pudding, and saffron meringues. On the savoury front, they go well with game, so it’s worth freezing a few trays and waiting until autumn brings its venison. Make a sauce, says Hale, with shallots, rosemary, chicken stock and wine, add in a little vinegar, honey and five spice, then introduce the blackcurrants near the end so that you end up with a very fresh and fruity slick of sauce for your pink meat. Even simpler is a blackcurrant vinaigrette from David Morris, fruit buyer at Booths, made from blackcurrants squashed with red wine vinegar and hazelnut oil, which is also good on game such as wild duck. And don’t waste the leaves, says Morris: drop a few into your custard when making a crème brûlée to add flavour, then pick them out before setting and serving the dessert. Blackcurrants are also a very fine mixer if you enjoy a cocktail or two. Hilditch began making her British Cassis to use up a surplus 10 years ago. She trampled fruit in a half-tonne bin and mixed it up with a drill. Methods are more sophisticated these days, but it’s all still done by hand. She describes is as a “British take on the French staple, but infinitely more delicious, less sweet and syrupy and really fruity.” It works as a base for recipes as well as cocktails. Her neighbours at Pixley Court make pressed juices and cordials, sold as Pixley Berries, from berries, sugar and water, and recommend mixing them with dry or sparkling white wine, or gin and a squeeze of fresh lemon. In Somerset, Richard Hollingbery began planting blackcurrants in his hedgerows as treats for his dairy herd at Godminster Farm, whose milk is used for vintage cheddar and brie. When he was looking for a way to use the excess berries, his thoughts turned to vodka. He now produces 400 bottles of blackcurrant vodka each year, which he recommends in champagne cocktails. Until the 1980s, Hilditch’s blackcurrants were picked by hand, but now she employs tractor drivers and workers who sort the fruit along a conveyor. She grows six varieties, all named after Scottish mountains, and the first to arrive is Ben Gairn, which she will be picking this weekend. Hilditch likes the Ben Starav, the plumpest and the sweetest, best. Marks and Spencer is attempting something of a blackcurrant revolution this summer. As much as they are loved for their tart flavour, blackcurrants can’t compete with sweeter berries, especially when it comes to snacking on uncooked berries, as we do with punnets of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. M\u0026S is bringing back a heritage variety, the Ebony blackcurrant, which you’ll find in stores from Monday, to see if it can re-engage our tastebuds. “In recent decades, the sweeter styles have fallen out of favour as blackcurrants have been predominantly used to make things such as cordials and flu powders, which require very intense flavours that the smaller, sharper varieties are more suited to,” explains Andy Mitchell, M\u0026S fruit expert. “So growers stopped growing the sweeter varieties.” “However, we think it’s time now to bring back the blackcurrant – it’s a classic British summer fruit. Our new Ebony variety is delicious and very healthy to snack on. It’s bigger than the sharper varieties and incredibly healthy – blackcurrants actually have more antioxidants than blueberries. Our blackcurrants are also hand-picked, which means we know they’re perfect quality.” Appearing as they do for only a few weeks in British summertime, blackcurrants are often considered to have a short season. The season isn’t really that short compared to any other fruit or veg. Rather, it stands out because we import so many types of fresh produce throughout the year but rely on frozen blackcurrants. They freeze well and retain all their goodness so there’s no reason not to stock up now. Harvest time varies up and down the country, according to the weather. Sunshine contributes to a high-quality fruit. However, if the weather is too hot, the blackcurrants might cook inside their own skins. Hilditch assures me the recent heatwave hasn’t damaged her crop too severely, so there will be no shortage of Ribena, for this year, at least. Recipe by Kirsty Hale, Riverford Blackcurrant compôte can be used for all sorts of things. Serve for breakfast with granola and yoghurt, swirl into vanilla ice cream to make a blackcurrant ripple, or serve with meringue and cream. It will freeze well, too, so it’s good for preserving the short blackcurrant season. We use Luscombe elderflower bubbly, made down the road from our farm with elderflower picked from our hedgerows, for the jelly. It keeps some of the bubbles, making a light pudding, perfect for summer days. You could also make a version using diluted elderflower cordial and water, if you can’t find a bubbly elderflower pressé. Ingredients to serve 4 450ml Luscombe elderflower bubbly, or another elderflower pressé 1x 12g sachet gelatine powder (or a 6.5g pack of vegetarian gel) 125g blackcurrants 1-2 tablespoons icing sugar, to taste 1 tablespoon water 3 finely chopped mint leaves (optional), plus a few small mint sprigs to serve Preparation Pour 120ml just-boiled water into a large heatproof jug or bowl. Stir in the gelatine powder, mixing well to dissolve all the powder. If it doesn’t all dissolve, put in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and stir until it does. Add the elderflower bubbly. Wait for a minute or two to let the mixture settle, then dab away any froth with kitchen paper. Pour into small glasses or bowls. Chill until set, approx 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the compôte: gently warm the blackcurrants, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and water in a pan until the blackcurrants just start to soften and release a little of their juice. Taste and add more icing sugar to your own preference for sweetness. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Stir in the fresh mint if using. Serve with the jellies, decorated with small mint sprigs.",

Jams aside, her top tip is to use redcurrants and blackcurrants in a summer pudding, along with strawberries and raspberries, packed into a pudding basin lined with a good white loaf. Adam Handling, head chef at Westminster restaurant Adam Handling at Caxton’s and Scottish Chef of the Year 2015, also likes to bring the sharpness to a sweet dish, using it with high-quality dark chocolate. “I have a dessert that includes a blackcurrant gel and ice cream to complement rich chocolate truffle and chocolate shortbread,” he says. “The blackcurrants provide a slight acidity, which balances the decadence of the chocolate.” Kirsty Hale, who writes Riverford Organic Farm’s recipes, makes the most of blackcurrants when they’re available, and freezes them for the rest of the year. They can add a hit to a rice pudding or clafoutis, she suggests, and matches them with elderflower jelly, a lemon pudding, and saffron meringues. On the savoury front, they go well with game, so it’s worth freezing a few trays and waiting until autumn brings its venison. Make a sauce, says Hale, with shallots, rosemary, chicken stock and wine, add in a little vinegar, honey and five spice, then introduce the blackcurrants near the end so that you end up with a very fresh and fruity slick of sauce for your pink meat. Even simpler is a blackcurrant vinaigrette from David Morris, fruit buyer at Booths, made from blackcurrants squashed with red wine vinegar and hazelnut oil, which is also good on game such as wild duck. And don’t waste the leaves, says Morris: drop a few into your custard when making a crème brûlée to add flavour, then pick them out before setting and serving the dessert. Blackcurrants are also a very fine mixer if you enjoy a cocktail or two. Hilditch began making her British Cassis to use up a surplus 10 years ago. She trampled fruit in a half-tonne bin and mixed it up with a drill. Methods are more sophisticated these days, but it’s all still done by hand. She describes is as a “British take on the French staple, but infinitely more delicious, less sweet and syrupy and really fruity.” It works as a base for recipes as well as cocktails. Her neighbours at Pixley Court make pressed juices and cordials, sold as Pixley Berries, from berries, sugar and water, and recommend mixing them with dry or sparkling white wine, or gin and a squeeze of fresh lemon. In Somerset, Richard Hollingbery began planting blackcurrants in his hedgerows as treats for his dairy herd at Godminster Farm, whose milk is used for vintage cheddar and brie. When he was looking for a way to use the excess berries, his thoughts turned to vodka. He now produces 400 bottles of blackcurrant vodka each year, which he recommends in champagne cocktails. Until the 1980s, Hilditch’s blackcurrants were picked by hand, but now she employs tractor drivers and workers who sort the fruit along a conveyor. She grows six varieties, all named after Scottish mountains, and the first to arrive is Ben Gairn, which she will be picking this weekend. Hilditch likes the Ben Starav, the plumpest and the sweetest, best. Marks and Spencer is attempting something of a blackcurrant revolution this summer. As much as they are loved for their tart flavour, blackcurrants can’t compete with sweeter berries, especially when it comes to snacking on uncooked berries, as we do with punnets of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. M\u0026S is bringing back a heritage variety, the Ebony blackcurrant, which you’ll find in stores from Monday, to see if it can re-engage our tastebuds. “In recent decades, the sweeter styles have fallen out of favour as blackcurrants have been predominantly used to make things such as cordials and flu powders, which require very intense flavours that the smaller, sharper varieties are more suited to,” explains Andy Mitchell, M\u0026S fruit expert. “So growers stopped growing the sweeter varieties.” “However, we think it’s time now to bring back the blackcurrant – it’s a classic British summer fruit. Our new Ebony variety is delicious and very healthy to snack on. It’s bigger than the sharper varieties and incredibly healthy – blackcurrants actually have more antioxidants than blueberries. Our blackcurrants are also hand-picked, which means we know they’re perfect quality.” Appearing as they do for only a few weeks in British summertime, blackcurrants are often considered to have a short season. The season isn’t really that short compared to any other fruit or veg. Rather, it stands out because we import so many types of fresh produce throughout the year but rely on frozen blackcurrants. They freeze well and retain all their goodness so there’s no reason not to stock up now. Harvest time varies up and down the country, according to the weather. Sunshine contributes to a high-quality fruit. However, if the weather is too hot, the blackcurrants might cook inside their own skins. Hilditch assures me the recent heatwave hasn’t damaged her crop too severely, so there will be no shortage of Ribena, for this year, at least. Elderflower bubbly jelly with blackcurrant compôte A blackcurrant compôte tops an elderflower jelly. Recipe by Kirsty Hale, Riverford. Blackcurrant compôte can be used for all sorts of things. Serve for breakfast with granola and yoghurt, swirl into vanilla ice cream to make a blackcurrant ripple, or serve with meringue and cream. It will freeze well, too, so it’s good for preserving the short blackcurrant season. We use Luscombe elderflower bubbly, made down the road from our farm with elderflower picked from our hedgerows, for the jelly. It keeps some of the bubbles, making a light pudding, perfect for summer days. You could also make a version using diluted elderflower cordial and water, if you can’t find a bubbly elderflower pressé. Ingredients to serve 4. For the jelly. 450ml Luscombe elderflower bubbly, or another elderflower pressé. 1x 12g sachet gelatine powder (or a 6.5g pack of vegetarian gel) For the compôte. 125g blackcurrants. 1-2 tablespoons icing sugar, to taste. 1 tablespoon water. 3 finely chopped mint leaves (optional), plus a few small mint sprigs to serve. Preparation. Pour 120ml just-boiled water into a large heatproof jug or bowl. Stir in the gelatine powder, mixing well to dissolve all the powder. If it doesn’t all dissolve, put in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and stir until it does. Add the elderflower bubbly. Wait for a minute or two to let the mixture settle, then dab away any froth with kitchen paper. Pour into small glasses or bowls. Chill until set, approx 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the compôte: gently warm the blackcurrants, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and water in a pan until the blackcurrants just start to soften and release a little of their juice. Taste and add more icing sugar to your own preference for sweetness. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Stir in the fresh mint if using. Serve with the jellies, decorated with small mint sprigs.

Taking a look at the key stats from last season to highlight every teams’ top performers and give us a steer for the upcoming campaign. Lastly, the men at the sharp end – the Forwards… All players must’ve played 10 matches to be considered and have been measured in the following categories: Appearances (Apps), Goals (Gls) and Assists (Ass). Players are listed per team, in recommended order of Fantasy value, or appeal for next season. *Playing for Man United Forward thinking: Diego Costa will be top of many manager’s wish list and rightly so. Only started 24 matches which might be a slight concern – and he does like a booking, but expect more of the same from Diego. Ramadel Falcao will adopt the Drogba role so poor old Loic Remy doesn’t even get promotion to chief bridesmaid. Forward thinking: Sergio Aguero is very much the man at Man City. No guarantees as to where Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko will be playing their football next season. Or how much game time Wilfried Bony will get. Forward thinking: These two shared the central strikers role last season but Olivier Giroud hogged all the goals. Danny Welbeck’s versatility will get him plenty of game time, but when it comes to end product this is a mis-match. Man United Apps Gls Ass Robin van Persie 25 (2) 10 2 Forward thinking: Wayne Rooney is not the most spectacular pick – or player – as he once was but as close as you’ll get to a guarantee in the PL. A quiet-ish season for United and Wazza last season so could represent a spot of value. Robin van Persie played a surprising number of matches – more than Costa – but never looked right. Whoever replaces him is of much more interest… Forward thinking: Whether Harry Kane can pick up where he left off last time is one of the burning questions of pre-season. Head and shoulders Spurs’ best option though and likely to produce the goods again. But you’ll have to pay for it this time… Forward thinking: Looking at this lot makes you feel a bit sorry for Brendan Rodgers. If Sturridge stays fit then Rodgers and any FL managers prepared to take a punt will be smiling. Lambert and Borini will be squabbling for bench space and Mario is as fragile as Daniel Sturridge’s thigh muscles. Forward thinking: Pelle’s numbers are decent, but much of best work was done in the opening quarter of the season – much like Southampton. I’ve a feeling he might have been found out and is a candidate for ‘second season syndrome’. If he – and his team-mates – repeat last season’s heroics, he will have done very well. Forward thinking: During a spectacular last quarter of the season – where Gomis scored six of his seven goals - the sale of Bony looked like a shrewd bit of business. Next season he will be joined by Portuguese striker Eder who is of similar stature (i.e. monstrous). Not sure there will be room for both in the team (or dressing room). Forward thinking: Diouf had a solid season and we can expect at least the same again. Walters is the next best pick - if categorized as a Forward, that is – with Crouch’s dubious gifts diminish and question marks over Bojan’s fitness. Forward thinking: Palace’s 10th place finish was all the more remarkable when you consider that no Forward played more than 15 matches, or scored more than seven goals. Midfield is the area to plunder for FL managers unless Palace can add the Charlie Austin or Loic Remy-type they hanker for. Forward thinking: For me, Lukaku flatters to deceive a little bit – and last season was his least productive in three. But he remains the stand out Everton Forward and focal point of their attack. West Ham Apps Gls Ass Andy Carroll 12 (2) 5 1 Enner Valencia 25 (7) 4 3 Forward thinking: Like West Ham started like a man on fire, scoring seven of his ten in the opening quarter of the season. Looks The Hammers best option though with Carroll’s delicate ankles and Valencia yet to convince in the PL. Forward thinking: On the face of it, 14 is a good return from Berahino. But his managers had to endure an eight-match and a ten-match barren spell during the campaign. Seems the streaky type to me (i.e. hot or cold, nothing in between). Handle with care. Forward thinking: Vardy stole most of the headlines, probably because his real emergence coincided with Leicester’s Houdini act. But Ulloa had a decent season in a largely struggling team. Kramaric scored zillions in Croatia before his January move if you fancy a cheap wild-card… Forward thinking: Cisse has goals in him, that much we know. But he is also prone to the odd disappearing act – during matches and in the treatment room. If McClaren can get 30 matches out of him, he’ll get a goal return in the teens. But suspect buying someone in is the more reliable route. Forward thinking: Just 15 goals between three strikers tells us that if Sunderland bring in a striker he will immediately be their most desirable. Defoe, at least, has PL pedigree so might be a consideration for a third choice if you are low on funds. Otherwise pass. Forward thinking: If manager Tim Sherwood can ‘do an Adebayor’ on Benteke he could be a snip. He could also end up Liverpool and has the Euros as an inspiration, so there is plenty to like about Benteke. Plus, Villa surely can’t be as bad again, can they? Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. Goals won’t be as easy to come by playing with the big boys, of course. But their last season stats will give us a few clues about what we can expect… Forward thinking: Kermorgant and Pitman contributed massively to Bournemouth’s success, but Callum Wilson has the look of being this season’s Charlie Austin or Danny Ings. Well worth a look. Forward thinking: Whether Ighalo, Yvdra and Abdi are categorized as Forwards or Midfielders will have a big impact on their FL value. If Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson is this season’s Danny Ings, Deeney is the Jamie Vardy – he was playing for non-league Halesowen less than a decade ago. Forward thinking: Jerome has plenty of PL experience is certainly the pick here. But has been a scoring of great goals, rather than a great goal scorer. Pick well and be lucky, friends.

Forward thinking: Cisse has goals in him, that much we know. But he is also prone to the odd disappearing act – during matches and in the treatment room. If McClaren can get 30 matches out of him, he’ll get a goal return in the teens. But suspect buying someone in is the more reliable route. Sunderland. Apps. Gls. Ass. Conor Wickham. 31 (5) 5. 1. 20 (10) 5. 2. 17. 4. 0. Forward thinking: Just 15 goals between three strikers tells us that if Sunderland bring in a striker he will immediately be their most desirable. Defoe, at least, has PL pedigree so might be a consideration for a third choice if you are low on funds. Otherwise pass. Aston Villa. Apps. Gls. Ass. 26 (3) 13 2 Gabriel Agbonlahor. 30 (4) 6. 1. Forward thinking: If manager Tim Sherwood can ‘do an Adebayor’ on Benteke he could be a snip. He could also end up Liverpool and has the Euros as an inspiration, so there is plenty to like about Benteke. Plus, Villa surely can’t be as bad again, can they? Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. Goals won’t be as easy to come by playing with the big boys, of course. But their last season stats will give us a few clues about what we can expect… Bournemouth. Apps. Gls. Ass. 45. 20. 7. 26 (12) 15. 10. 18 (16) 13. 2. Forward thinking: Kermorgant and Pitman contributed massively to Bournemouth’s success, but Callum Wilson has the look of being this season’s Charlie Austin or Danny Ings. Well worth a look. Watford. Apps. Gls. Ass. 37 (5) 21. 9. Odion Ighalo. 22 (13) 20. 3. 31 (11) 16. 5. 24 (4) 9. 2. Forward thinking: Whether Ighalo, Yvdra and Abdi are categorized as Forwards or Midfielders will have a big impact on their FL value. If Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson is this season’s Danny Ings, Deeney is the Jamie Vardy – he was playing for non-league Halesowen less than a decade ago. Norwich. Apps. Gls. Ass. 36 (9) 20. 7. 16 (16) 12. 6. 23 (13) 12. 3. Forward thinking: Jerome has plenty of PL experience is certainly the pick here. But has been a scoring of great goals, rather than a great goal scorer. Pick well and be lucky, friends. Matt Nesbitt is a one-time player, long-time tipster and full-time fan of the beautiful game.

    "DiffbotBody": "CLEVELAND — Danny Salazar scattered five hits while allowing an unearned run in 8⅔ innings and the Cleveland Indians used a four-run sixth inning to beat the Oakland Athletics 5-1 on Friday night. Salazar (8-4), who came within one out of his second career complete game, struck out eight. The right-hander retired the first two hitters in the ninth before Ben Zobrist doubled and Billy Butler was hit by an 0-2 pitch. Cody Allen came on and got Ike Davis on a foul out for his 19th save, and third in three nights. Oakland’s only run came in the first after an error by second baseman Jason Kipnis. After Billy Burns led off with a single, Mark Canha reached on Kipnis’ error on a fielder’s choice. Canha was forced at second on Josh Redick’s grounder and Zobrist walked to load the bases. Butler then had a sacrifice fly. Kendall Graveman (6-5) allowed four runs in 6⅔ innings for his first loss since June 13. Graveman’s 19-inning scoreless streak ended on Yan Gomes’ RBI double in the fourth that tied the score. Kipnis drew a bases-loaded walk in the sixth off reliever Drew Pomeranz to put Cleveland ahead 2-1. Francisco Lindor walked to force in another run and Michael Brantley had a two-run single. Cleveland has won four in a row and nine of 12. The Athletics have dropped nine of 14. Carlos Santana singled off Graveman to start the sixth and took third on Giovanny Urshela’s two-out single. Michael Bourn walked to load the bases. Pomeranz replaced Graveman but issued a five-pitch walk to Kipnis. Lindor walked on a full-count pitch, prompting a visit from pitching coach Curt Young. Brantley lined the next pitch into center field for a 5-1 lead. comments powered by Disqus",

Good manners aren’t important only at the dinner table, says Joey Thurman, a Chicago-based fitness, lifestyle and nutrition expert. “I don’t want you near me if you’re loud, you smell and don’t clean up after yourself,” Thurman says. “You need to be aware of your surroundings, and how to keep from disrupting those around you.” Even in the rough-and-tumble workout world, proper gym etiquette will make others friendlier toward you and create a healthier atmosphere for everyone.

Whether you’re a longtime exerciser or just starting to get in shape, you need to know – and follow – these rules of the workout floor. Read on for Thurman’s top 12 gym etiquette tips… 1. Wash your workout clothes – often. It’s not just guys’ gym clothes that can smell like a dead rodent within 20 minutes of a workout. Airing sweat-soaked workout wear in your locker only temporarily kills the odor. When you perspire in them again, you double the stink factor. Just do it: Wash your workout clothes after each use. Plus, keep at least one clean outfit with you or in your gym locker. 2. Use deodorant. You may think: I’m just going to get sweaty anyway, so why bother slapping on deodorant before heading to the gym? Here’s why: If you’re exercising with enough intensity to get fit, you’re also sweating enough to create toxic body odor – and others around you will notice. Plus, exercise raises your body temperature enough that you may keep sweating after the workout’s finished. Just do it: Before your workout, put on deodorant or clean your armpits with a baby wipe or soap and water. Then, after your post-workout shower, apply deodorant again. 3. Pass on perfume. Wearing fragrances to cover up exercise odors doesn’t work. As you heat up, the cologne and perspiration combine, creating a scent that’s probably unpleasant. Just do it: Hold off on even a light application of perfume or cologne until after your workout is finished. 4. Go for fitness, not flirting. Most people go to the gym to exercise, not socialize. So that hot guy on the treadmill wearing headphones may just want to be left alone. Just do it: Don’t hit on fellow gym-goers. If you need help with a machine or technique, ask your question quickly, without flirting. Meanwhile, if a gym lothario tries to pick you up, politely tell him that you want to focus on your workout. If he refuses to leave you alone, contact the management. 5. Tone down the makeup. You’re at the gym for one reason only – to get fit! There’s no need to get glammed up. If you’re working out correctly, you’ll sweat and heavy makeup will run. Just do it: Leave the glitter and makeup at home. 6. Don’t be Ms. Know-It-All. It’s great that you just soaked up the latest issue of Fitness magazine. Still, no matter how knowledgeable you are, correcting other people’s exercise technique will only annoy them. Even worse, if they get injured, they’ll blame you. Just do it: Avoid the temptation to offer help or advice unless someone asks you. 7. Clean up after yourself. Sitting in a pool of someone else’s sweat is awful. So is touching a clammy, wet elliptical-machine handle. Just do it: Use sanitizing spray to wipe down equipment before and after using it. And carry a towel with you to dry off mats and machines when you leave a station. 8. Silence is golden. You may love to sing to tunes while you work out. But others may not think your voice is golden. And don’t grunt as you lift a heavy weight. It just screams, “Look at me!” Just do it: Keep noise to a minimum. Wear headphones that don’t leak too much sound, don’t sing along with the music and save the cell phone calls for later. 9. Share the gear. When a gym is crowded, be mindful of those around you waiting their turn for equipment or machines. Just do it: Use one set of barbells at a time; avoid stowing 10 pieces of gym equipment in your own corner. Get up from machines when your set is over. 10. Give fellow gym-goers some breathing room. When the sweat starts flying, people don’t want to be bathed in yours. So try not to crowd them. Just do it: Unless the gym is packed, leave at least one space between you and others using aerobic equipment. Also, when waiting to use machines or weights, stand apart from those using them. It’s dangerous to get too close and it distracts others. 11. Cover up. Nudity can make others uncomfortable. Stripping down to change clothes in the locker room is one thing, but walking around in your birthday suit is another. Just do it: Wrap a towel around yourself when walking to the shower, exiting the shower and drying your hair. 12. Spare the water fountain. Monopolizing the water fountain as you fill an oversized plastic container, while people are in line behind you for just a sip, is annoying and rude. Just do it: Fill a water bottle at home. If you want to top it off during your workout, do so a little at a time. Connect with Us Get more healthy food for thought – check out our posts on Health Bistro and Lifescript TV videos on YouTube.

SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron A pair of ex-paramilitary battle cats that went rouge after being ostracized from their law enforcement squad, and become their own crime fighting team? Magic. This aired from 1993, but was sadly cancelled in 1995. 2. Freakazoid This cartoon came in 1995 and was about a 16-year-old boy who was sucked into his computer and absorbed all the information on the internet, turning him into Freakazoid! Given that the internet was pretty new back then, this storyline was actually plausible, but it was cancelled in 1997. 3. Ghostwriter A team of radically diverse kids solved mysteries with the help of a friendly ghost who communicates by manipulating words in its surroundings. Mind blowing that this ever got cancelled, but it did, after three years. 4. The Pirates of Dark Water An alien world being overridden by some creepy, dirty water? Too scary for most kids. That might be why it was cancelled in 1993. 5. Gargoyles Gargoyles had a fantastic mix of dark themes, terrific animation and underlying themes of sexual diversity, immigration and acceptance. We have no idea why this ever got cancelled, but it did, in 1997. 6. Midnight Patrol Four friends, Keiko, Carter, Nick and Rosie, went to sleep and were charged with missions by the Snooze Patrol. Fantastic TV, but it was cancelled in 1990. 7. V.R. Troopers The sister series to the might power rangers was the V.R. Troopers, created to latch on to the world’s new-found fascination with virtual reality. 8. Clarissa Explains It All Clarissa was probably the first Nickelodeon show to have a female lead. It was great fun too, and paved the way for the other sci-fi badass shows that came along.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Yesterday, we reported on a potentially massive Game of Thrones spoiler that now seems to have been confirmed. Sources are claiming that Jon Snow actor Kit Harington is definitely in Belfast filming episodes for the sixth season of Game of Thrones. Earlier this week, we learned that Miley Cyrus will host the 2015 VMAs, and the Internet immediately began buzzing with predictions about what we should expect. After all, Miley's VMA performance with Robin Thicke remains one of the most memorable moments in the show's history, and for better or worse, her hosting gig is sure to have plenty of people talking the next day. Great. This is so NOT what Kourtney Kardashian needs at the moment. According to the latest issue of Life \u0026 Style, just weeks after finally dumping Scott Disick, the reality star has discovered that she's pregnant. An official photo of the heir to the British monarchy, Prince George, has been released in honor of the youngster's second birthday today. The adorably cool picture, taken by fashion photographer Mario Testino, shows the toddler smiling in the arms of his dad, Prince William: Good to see that Teresa Giudice is still major causing drama in the Garden State from the unfriendly, federal prison confines of Danbury, Conn. After they learned Teresa signed a contract to return to Bravo, the rest of the Real Housewives of New Jersey cast members were up in arms. Last night on an enthralling Total Divas Season 4 Episode 3, peace talks between Nikki and Eva did not end the way you might have expected. Or hoped for. We sort of expected them to go to crap. Mention the initials JFK to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of American history, and the images that spring to mind will likely have little to do with his political achievements. Instead, the modern imagination springs right to John Fitzgerald Kennedy's grisly assassination in 1963 and the many infidelities that he reportedly engaged in throughout his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Ah, Donald Trump. Just when you think he's sunk as low as he can possible go, he manages to find a new rock bottom. First, Trump makes wildly racist comments right at the beginning of his presidential campaign. Khloe Kardashian is making big changes to her personal life and her professional life. As previously reported, the reality star has at least finalized her divorce from Lamar Odom, while she also may or may not be having a baby on her own. If you're all caught up on the battle for the Iron Throne (and if you're not, we suggest you go watch Game of Thrones online ASAP, because the spoilers will be flying fast and furious for the next ten months), then you probably already know who we're talking about from that headline. Scott Disick has seen better days, according to a new report. The unpopular reality star, who often acted like a drunken buffoon even when in a supposedly good place, is \"spiraling out of control\" in the wake of his split from Kourtney Kardashian. Blake Shelton isn't the only member of The Voice panel to have undergone a life change this week. But while Shelton filed for divorce from Miranda Lambert after four years of marriage, Adam Levine is still happily waking up in bed next to Behati Prinsloo each morning. The Bachelorette Season 11 Episode 11 saw the Men Tell All last night. Yet in doing so, they really didn't tell us much that we didn't know. So it goes for the show's annual penultimate installment, which is basically filler designed to drag out the season and hype up the finale. Earlier today, the world learned that beloved country superstars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert are getting divorced. While no reason for the split has been revealed as of yet, the couple issued a joint statement moments ago confirming that they're ending their four-year marriage and asking fans to respect their privacy. By now, you've probably heard that Kourtney Kardashian came to her senses and dumped Scott Disick like the douchey bad habit that he is. Sources say there was no one nail in the coffin, as a number of different factors led Kourtney to pull the plug on her 9-year relationship: According to one of the stars at the center of the Taylor Swift-Calvin Harris romance, these two stars are insanely happy together. And Swift says she has one person to thank for her ongoing relationship with the popular DJ: The two best-known transgender stars on the planet came together for the first time this weekend. Laverne Cox shared a photo on her Instagram account of her and Caitlyn Jenner hanging out at an advanced screening yesterday of the latter’s upcoming E! reality series, I Am Cait. ABC's new Bachelor in Paradise Season 2 promo offers our first glimpse at the crazy times coming our way on Sunday, August 2. And we mean crazy. By our count, there are at least a half dozen makeout sessions and breakdown sessions in this teaser alone! Demi Moore has issued a statement in response to a stunning tragedy that took place at her home over the weekend. As reported by multiple outlets, the body of a 21-year old man was found dead in the actress' swimming pool early Sunday morning following a party at the residence on Saturday night.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Water from a public hydrant that Tom Selleck has been accused of stealing from in dry California was legally purchased, an official said. The Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County sued the \"Magnum, P.I.\" star, alleging that a tanker truck filled up at the hydrant and took it to Selleck's 60-acre ranch more than a dozen times in the past two years. The district announced a tentative settlement with Selleck on Thursday. Jay Spurgin, public works director for Thousand Oaks, said a construction company paid a fee to secure the rights to draw water from the city hydrant two years ago. About 1.4 million gallons of water were taken from the hydrant during that period. \"There was water used during that time, and it was paid for,\" he said. Construction firms and contractors can obtain special meters that allow them to haul water from hydrants for large projects. Companies can draw as much water as they need or sell it to a third party as long as they pay the monthly service charge and water bill, Spurgin said. The water meter in question was removed in June. It's unclear if Selleck or his employees bought the water from the company or another source. A representative for Selleck didn't immediately return a request for comment on Friday. The water district said it spent nearly $22,000 for a private detective to investigate.

    "DiffbotBody": "What a difference a year makes. Last summer, you couldn't set foot in public without hearing about how \"fancy\" Iggy Azalea is. In 2015, however, the Aussie femcee is about as popular as Crocodile Dundee and other short-lived trends from Down Under. It's been over a week since news of the Josh Duggar sexual abuse charges was made public, and the usually outspoken 19 Kids and Counting clan has been uncharacteristically quiet ever since. Both Josh and his parents issued public statements shortly after the accusations were revealed, but many of their fans and critics believe the responses were woefully inadequate. Ready for a second helping of Cookie? Fox has announced a premiere date for Empire Season 2, which will be comprised of 18 total episodes and broken into two nine-episode halves. Vanderpump Rules stars Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix were named the Sexiest Couple of 2015, an actual award handed out by OK! Magazine. And what worthy winners they are! Just look at these two hotties! Earlier this week, we reported that Calvin Harris was caught cheating on Taylor Swift, and rather than penning a tearful ballad about like she would've in her crimped-hair \"country\" days, Swifty simply confronted her new boo and told him she's having none of it. It may seem like Calvin got off easy, but sources close to Caylor say that in addition to receiving an ultimatum, the Scottish DJ was sentenced to 1,000 hours of Orange is the New Black reruns: Today in \"Tell us what you really think!\" news Mariah Carey positively went off on American Idol when asked about her stint on the show in a recent interview. Mariah didn't last very long as a judge (thanks in part to her hugely entertaining feud with Nicki Minaj), but she's been discussing the long-running series as a result of the recent news that Idol will be coming to an end after 15 seasons. Happy Flashback Friday, THG readers! In honor of this weekly occasion, we're going all the way back to 1999 with the stars of Cruel Intentions, as Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair proved yesterday that time has treated them very well. Days before the Josh Duggar molestation scandal broke, it seems his wife Anna Duggar knew exactly what storm was about to hit. She posted cryptic quote about forgiveness on Instagram, one that's easy to interpret much differently in light of what we now know. While his crimes took place well over a decade ago, it was only last week that the public learned about Josh Duggar molesting his sisters and several other young girls. A coordinated effort by the Duggars and their handlers helped keep Josh out of jail and the accusations under wraps, but now that the truth is finally out, Josh's young victims are understandably feeling that old wounds have been reopened. Like many 19 Kids and Counting fans, Bringing Up Bates stars Gil and Kelly Jo Bates are reeling from the Josh Duggar molestation scandal. For the UpTV twosome, based in Tennessee and longtime friends of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, there is little to say and a lot to pray for. Sources have confirmed that ABC has reached a new marketing low. Earlier today, the network premiered its sef-proclaimed Brokeback Bachelorette promo in which contestants Clint and JJ claimed to be \"in love.\" Last year, both Brad Pitt and George Clooney got married, and neither attended the other one's wedding. The old \"scheduling conflict\" excuses were bandied about, but are we really expected to believe that multi-millionaire A-list celebrities are incapable of taking a day off to go to a wedding? We watched them go from 16 to 19 kids (and counting!), and now it looks as though we'll see the Duggars get booted from the network that made them famous. Several advertisers have bailed on 19 Kids and Counting in the wake of the Josh Duggar molestation scandal, and today, the show was dealt another crushing blow when all episodes were pulled from the popular streaming TV streaming service Hulu.

It was a weekend to give the lakes to the pleasure boaters and jet skiers. Advertisement With a lot of walleye anglers from the area going to Leech Lake, that kind of shows how the bite has been around Brainerd. Which brings me back to my quest to find out what's up with Gull Lake. I hear the tourism in the area is above average, which we can tell by how busy town is. But after days of fishing and no fish, are they coming back? Then I hear fish numbers are average for Gull Lake. Then another thought I have been hearing is that stocked fish stay in the weeds because they grow up in weeds and it is familiar to them. But Gull is mainly stocked with fry, which do not grow up in weeds. Myself and most other anglers remember when you could always go out and catch a few fish during the day, but now those days are few and far between. You can still catch fish during the primetime hours and after dark. So I guess its time to get the headlamp on and go fishin'.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Comment Last year, North Easton residents thought they’d be browsing the menu at a hot new dining spot by now. Instead, they were staring at a huge “for sale” sign outside the 114 Main St. property. Developer David Howe slapped the sign on the fence in front of the vacant lot – and the site of his future 200- to 300-seat eatery - on June 25, the day after the Zoning Board of Appeals rescinded its May 19 variance of onsite parking requirements and left his project in permitting limbo. The stalemate between local officials and Howe over what was described as a procedural “conundrum” showed no sign of letting up this week. On Monday, Howe’s attorneys told selectmen they had filed an Open Meeting Law complaint with the Attorney General’s office. They claim the ZBA violated the law on June 24 by meeting without the required “super majority” of four voting members present, withdrew its May 19 approval of the variances and then tried to illegally approve ones with news conditions on parking. “If you need a supermajority to get the variance, you need a supermajority to change the variance,” Doug Troyer said. “My client is now in a position where he has to vigorously defend this.” Troyer also questions the legality of the posted agenda, which stated the board was to discuss, not reconsider, the issue of 114 Main St. He wants to know what occurred after the May 19 vote and why the six variances approved - including a waiver of onsite parking requirements - were not written up and submitted to the town clerk for final adoption before June 24 - just two days shy of the deadline for action. Town Counsel Jay Talerman disagreed, saying the board could call meetings and “flip-flop every day until they actually file the decision.” He said ZBA Vice-chairman Thomas Pursley called the June 24 session because he thought the parking issue was important enough to have the board reconsider the May variances “out of an abundance of caution.” Pursley had cast the lone dissenting vote on May 19, citing a bylaw requirement for 83 parking spots. He said Howe’s lease with developer Doug King for 100 valet spots, his access to municipal and on street parking might not be sufficient to protect a congested, downtown area, especially if the lease were not renewed. “He has “zero” onsite parking spots,” Pursley said. “You can’t have a restaurant that seats 300 people and have nowhere to park their cars.” He failed to convince his colleagues to condition the variance subject to a six-month review. But on June 24, and with only three voting members present - Pursley, Michael Spillane and Ryan Cook - the board voted to rescind the May 19 vote and pass a new variance with parking conditions requiring Howe to come back with a new plan within six months if he lost King’s lot. » Comment or view comments",
    "LabBody": "Page 2 of 3. - They asked Howe if he would extend the hearing for another two weeks so a supermajority of the board could meet to make it official. Howe refused and only the rescinded variance remains in effect. Talerman said he “certainly alerted the chairman as to the conundrum” he faced. “The board was left with an awkward situation. They felt it was important enough to move forward.” Meanwhile, angry residents accused local government officials of playing “tug-of-war” with North Easton Village over a restaurant everyone wants. Patty Locke of 161 Norton Ave. urged selectmen to get second opinion from another legal counsel. “I was frankly embarrassed for the town by the way Mr. Howe was treated. It just doesn’t seem legal to me,” she said Monday night. “I’m just incensed about it.” Town Administrator David Colton said the town had put years of effort into revitalizing North Easton Village and paving the way for Howe to redevelop the 114 Main St. site. “We’ve all been rowing in the same direction,” Colton said. He said zoning board members “did their job to the best of their ability.” Talerman said the gulf between the two parties remained “fairly large.” On June 6, Howe’s attorney Andrew Daniels requested records of all documents, emails and text messages sent between zoning board members and between the ZBA and Colton since May 20. The request was sent to Colton, Pursley and Town Clerk Jeremy Gillis. Colton said he was complying with the request that encompasses an “extremely broad” amount of information. He noted that anything relating to attorney-client privilege could be exempt. The state allows public officials to withhold some closed session minutes, after the courts ruled that confidential communications between government boards and their attorneys were entitled to the same attorney-client protections as those of individuals. Troyer later said the ZBA could simply drop its June 24 action and return to the May 19 vote. The fact that the June 24 decision was immediately filed with the town clerk the following day complicated the issue, he said. Talerman said Howe could reapply for the variances and proceed with his project. But Howe, who was awarded the bid by the town to redevelop the property into a restaurant, said “the action by the Board of Appeals, purportedly denying the variance, after I purchased the property from the town for the specific purpose of constructing and operating a restaurant on the site, is simply not in the best interest of the revitalization of the Village. “Without the variance, I have little option but to attempt to repurpose the site for something other than a restaurant, such as a parking lot, or sell the property,” he said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Update July 17th - Microsoft has now updated its lifecycle support page to list Windows 10. It states the end of Mainstream Support as October 13, 2020 and the end of Extended Support (security) as October 14, 2025. This is great news and I think these time periods are fair and inline with previous Windows releases. Windows 10 is famously ‘free’, but Microsoft has been worryingly silent about just how free it really is. Now, only 17 days before release, leaks suggest ‘free’ Windows 10 might not be a good deal at all… The news comes from ComputerWorld which attained Microsoft internal slides that strongly suggest many Windows 10 owners will have to start paying to receive updates within two years. The key lines ComputerWorld discovered are: “Revenue allocated is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades are expected to be provided by estimated device life…. [The estimated device life] can range from two to four years.” ‘Device life’ is the key phrase here. Microsoft has already stated revenue earned from Windows 10 must be deferred because of the free upgrade model (cash isn’t taken upfront), but it repeatedly stressed Windows 10 owners can expect to get free updates for the “supported lifetime of the device”. The problem is Microsoft hadn’t defined how long the ‘supported lifetime of the device’ will be and now we see it: “two to four years”. Edit: I am in ongoing communication with Microsoft and it states the slides in question are from a financial analyst briefing which did not focus on the servicing model. I have asked for clarification of the terms used in these slides including “supported lifetime of the device” but have been told Microsoft is “not yet sharing full details of the service model”. With Windows 10 going on sale in just over two weeks I have asked Microsoft to reconsider and will update if it does. Is This A Two Year Con? So what does “two to four years” mean? Is it two or is it four? In light of no official clarification from Microsoft the slides can help – if not result in formal conclusions. In a change of language Microsoft states device lifetime will be determined by “customer type” whereas it had previously stated it would be determined by “form factor”. This may prove crucial. For example ‘Form factor’ should mean a phone where two years of support isn’t great, but survivable and similarly four years support for a tablet or PC which isn’t great but it is survivable. But defining by ‘customer type’ invokes Microsoft’s two main customer licence types: Home (average consumer) and Professional (prosumer/business). By this new definition “two to four years” would mean two years free support for Windows 10 Home users regardless of their device type and up to four years free support for Windows 10 Pro users regardless of their device type. Two years free support on a PC is garbage. It would see Windows 10 free support expire in 2017 while Windows 7 and Windows 8 free support doesn’t expire until January 2020 and 2023 respectively. Could this really happen? Again without Microsoft spelling it out we can’t say. What’s more it also opens up an even bigger question: what follows the expiry of free support? There are several ways of looking at this. Most charitably Microsoft could release ‘Windows 10.1’ and then kickstart another two years of free support, the same again for ‘Windows 10.2’ and so on which pushes users to keep updating. It’s a nice thought, but Microsoft already has a strict threat in place for those who lag behind. The other perspective returns us to the “deferred revenue” Microsoft says it will encounter with Windows 10. The interesting part is Microsoft claims the money it loses from the free upgrades will be made up within three years. If there’s a free upgrade plus two years of free support (for all consumers) then the introduction of subscription based charging, this suddenly fits together and angry conspiracy theories run wild. What To Believe So what’s the answer? Frustratingly, infuriatingly, mystifyingly we have no way of knowing because – even with just three weeks to go before launch – Microsoft’s controlled drip feed of Windows 10 information shows no sign of speeding up. Yes it’s mad. Microsoft is releasing arguably the most important version of Windows in its history this month and we don’t know how long it will be supported or what future costs we will be charged after this unknown period. Instead Microsoft simply keeps shouting: “It’s Free! It’s Free! It’s Free!*” (*for the lifetime of the device – and we won’t define ‘lifetime’ or what happens after that) This sucks. It sucks because there could be a perfectly good explanation but Microsoft is not being open about it. It sucks because upgrading Windows versions is not an easy task for many users and even more of a hassle to downgrade if users find they’ve been shortchanged. And it really sucks for those who buy a new Windows 10 PC and are locked into the unknown. But most tragically it sucks because Windows 10 is actually a great OS. Throughout my participation in the Windows Insider testers program it has been the fastest, most stable series of Windows betas I’ve used, but Microsoft may be about to hamstring the whole thing. Promising ‘Free Windows 10′ then delivering ’Freemium-Windows-10-Get-Your-Credit-Cards-Out-In-Two-Years’ would be a disaster and right now Microsoft’s ongoing silence about how everything works feels ever more suspicious. Ultimately at this stage the company is either playing us or its naivety is now bordering on idiotic. It’s a crazy situation to be in where we all have to hope and pray it is the latter… ___ Hello Mr. Kelly, It appears my previous post may have been accidentally deleted. I’ll try again. 1. It’s concerning that you didn’t attempt to speak to Microsoft about this. As you are making claims about their behavior, their opinion would likely be a strong addition to your article’s credibility. 2. “It’s Free! …. *” (*for the lifetime of the device – and we won’t define ‘lifetime’ or what happens after that) The location of your text, directly above a truncated image of the Windows 10 upgrade details, implies that they are Microsoft’s words, but they are not. If you go to the windows 10 update details you can read them and see that there is no mention of the lifetime of the device anywhere. For your reader’s convenience, the update details are located here, towards the bottom of the page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/features From Microsoft: “Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.” Notice the lack of the asterisk. 3. I’m curious as to what wording in the slides “strongly suggests” many windows 10 owners will start paying to receive updates? I read the slides and saw nothing. Please provide evidence of this strong suggestion with a direct excerpt. It seems very unlikely that Microsoft would claim it’s free only to then start charging for it and deal with the insane PR failure that would bring. While I’m not a business major or an accountant, I would take a position contrary to yours. I interpret the slides as warning to investors or other stakeholders that all the revenue from purchases of Windows 10 licenses will not be recognized as income in the year that the purchase was made. In slide 5, it clearly shows that with the Window 10 model there will be unearned revenue which gets passed on to the following year. It doesn’t show zero revenue for 2 years, at which point revenue suddenly starts pouring in from the masses it has duped into paying for security updates it could have gotten for free with the product they already had. Much like when a business purchases a building, it defers the purchase price across the expected useful life of the building. That doesn’t mean when that period of time expires, the building is demolished and the business must pay for a new one to replace it. Counter to point 3 above, it doesn’t even remotely suggest that users will start paying for their updates after the expected lifetime of the device has passed. This “expected lifetime of the device” is obviously for Microsoft’s internal bookkeeping for financial statements; it is when Microsoft estimates certain “customer types” will have acquired a new piece of hardware which comes with a newly purchased OEM license, thus injecting a new set of Windows 10 revenue into the income deferral process. Finally, months ago Rafe Needleman from Yahoo spoke with a Microsoft representative and cleared this up. The result? If you aren’t in the special case of an enterprise or running windows 10 on virtual machines: It’s Free! It’s Free! It’s Free! … without an asterisk. I look forward to more explanation of your points.",

As a retired supervisor of school psychologists in our district, I am very much aware of the critical services they deliver. School psychologists provide students with individual and group counseling, data collection and progress monitoring, crisis intervention services, assessment for special education programs (ESE), consultation with teachers to develop educational interventions and behavior/ learning program development. When assessing students for ESE, there are state and federal mandates that require evaluations for special education be completed within a 60-day timeline. That timeline has recently been decreased from counting school days to calculating calendar days, which now includes days students are not in attendance. It is estimated across the state that this recent change will cause many districts to be out of compliance given current staffing levels, which could ultimately result in the loss of funding for ESE programs. Eliminating school psychologist positions is ill advised for this and for many other reasons. Polk County has a poverty rate of 39 percent as compared to the Florida rate of 19 percent. It is well documented that children of poverty have increased needs for supportive services to enable them to learn. Learning does not occur in isolation. With recent news events, we have seen the effects of not providing sufficient mental health services in our society. Teachers are being asked to monitor student progress with new procedures and school psychologists provide valuable assistance with data collection and interpretation. I implore the school system to reconsider this decision and restore the positions for the sake of our students, staff and the families in Polk County.

Like elephants, rhinos are often the victims of poachers, who hunt the animals for their ivory horn, which is a valuable commodity throughout Asia. This little guy, Gertjie, even had to make his own interspecies family after his mother was killed. That’s part of the reason that this video is so very precious! The Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark was very pleased to welcome its littlest new member, a very cute and wobbly male rhino calf. He’s the first rhino calf born at the zoo in 35 years, to a pleased and proud mama rhino in their cozy straw-lined barn. He’ll be with her until he’s weaned and gets too large to share the space. (Though, with a birth weight of approximately 110 lbs, he’s not exactly starting small, much like his hefty human equivalent, Avery. Those are some big babies!)

So much so that the group's own board commissioned the most extensive review to date about its work with the CIA and Pentagon in the years after the 9/11 attacks. Result? \"The collaboration was much more extensive than was previously known,\" reports the New York Times, which obtained a copy. In one example, the report found that two former presidents of the group served on an advisory panel for the CIA, and one delivered an assessment that sleep deprivation wasn't torture. The same person \"held a small ownership stake in a consulting company founded by two men who oversaw the agency’s interrogation program.\" In another case, the group's ethics director worked with a military psychologist on the association's policy statements about interrogations, and later got a Pentagon contract to train interrogators. The report concludes that the ethics office “prioritized the protection of psychologists—even those who might have engaged in unethical behavior—above the protection of the public.” It also says that when the CIA's own health officials raised objections to interrogation techniques, the APA helped \"blunt dissent within the agency.\" The board is expected to act on the report's findings soon, which could mean getting rid of officials named within.

    "DiffbotBody": "China (/ˈtʃaɪnə/; simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state located in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims the territories governed by Taiwan, a separate political entity officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), as its 23rd province, a claim which is controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas. The history of China goes back to the ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei. China had the largest and most complex economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it as seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2013, it is the world's second-largest economy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power parity (PPP), and is also the world's largest exporter and importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, with the second-largest defence budget. The PRC has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BCIM and the G-20. China is a regional power within Asia and has been characterized as a potential superpower by a number of commentators.",
    "LabBody": "China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party of China, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims the territories governed by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory, which includes the island of Taiwan as Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province. These claims are controversial because of the complex political status of Taiwan. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia.

    "DiffbotBody": "A homeless boy in the Philippines has inspired thousands of people online for his determination after a picture of him doing his homework outside a McDonald's made the rounds on social media. Medical student Joyce Torrefranca posted a photo in June of a young boy sitting on a makeshift chair and desk writing in a notebook in Mandaue City, Philippines. He's on the sidewalk just outside a McDonald's restaurant, using the light from inside to illuminate his work. Torrefranca posted the picture of the boy, nine-year-old Daniel Cabrera, on her Facebook page with the caption, \"I got inspired by a kid.\" It's since been shared more than 7,000 times, as people took it as a powerful sign of his determination to pursue his education. Local press tracked down Cabrera and learned more about his situation. According to Rappler, a Filipino social media-focused news site, Cabrera's father died three years ago, and his mother, Christiana Esponosa, makes 60 to 80 pesos ($5-6 CDN) a day working at a local food stall. She and her three youngest sons have lived in that space since their shanty home burned down five years ago. But the store has limited access to electric light, forcing Cabrera to find a way to do his homework outside instead. Cabrera told Rappler, that he owns only one pencil to do his homework, and keeps a rosary in his school bag to protect him from thieves. He says he wants to be either a police officer or a doctor when he grows up. The photo, and Cabrera's story, inspired others to action. Bayanihan Project, a site dedicated to helping lift people in the Philippines out of poverty, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money and school supplies for Cabrera and his family. So far they've raised more than 150,000 pesos, or over $12,000 CDN, more than three times their target amount. 'A symbol of poor slum boys in the city' \"We're overjoyed,\" Espinosa told Agence France-Presse on Friday. \"Now, Daniel will not have to suffer just to finish his studies.\" AFP reports that the family also received school supplies, student uniforms and a scholarship that would guarantee a college education. Perhaps the most symbolic gift, though, was a reading lamp. \"He has become a symbol of poor slum boys in the city who can't study because they don't have electricity,\" the city's social welfare office chief, Violeta Cavada, told AFP. \"I didn't think that a simple photo can make a huge difference. Thank you guys for sharing the photo,\" Torrefrance later posted on her Facebook page. \"With that, we were able to help Daniel in reaching his dreams. I hope Daniel's story will continue touching our hearts so that we will always be inspired and motivated in every situation we face in life.\"",

Van Gaal was speaking at the unveiling of Memphis Depay at Old Trafford, but with the £25million capture of the Dutch forward known for some time, it was news of Darmian's arrival that grabbed Friday's headlines. Upon being asked if there was any truth in the rumours that the Italian defender would be joining the club, Van Gaal responded: 'Matteo Darmian, I've read that in the papers. That is true,' before answering in the affirmative when asked if he was on his way for a medical. Darmian will undergo a medical at Carrington ahead of completing his move to the Premier League Darmian, who said goodbye to his Torino teammates and fans before heading to the UK, admitted to an Italian journalist that joining United would be the fulfilment of a lifelong dream. The Italian fullback landed in Manchester at 5.20pm on Friday, before heading to Carrington for a medical and to agree personal terms. Meanwhile, Van Gaal played down speculation linking goalkeeper David de Gea with a move to Real Madrid, believing the hype would not affect the Spaniard heading into the club's pre-season tour of the United States. 'I think he is a very professional player. He showed a fantastic attitude until now, the same as all my players, not just De Gea, but other players. It is also good that Memphis [Depay] does that. 'It is a difficult period when there are players who might be coming or going, but I cannot complain about the professional attitude of my players.' Van Gaal did not confirm that Robin van Persie was leaving Old Trafford, despite reports he will be joining Turkish side Fenerbache. 'When we feel that we can say he is gone, you shall hear it from us. And we don't have the feeling yet,' the Red Devils boss added.",

Like Us on Facebook Balor had an emotional victory over Owens in Tokyo, where the Artist Formerly Known as Prince Devitt spent much of his career. The fans were squarely behind him, and Balor even busted out some moves from his New Japan Pro Wrestling days in order to take out Owens. In the end, a second Coup De Grace put KO down for good and Balor scored the clean pin over his opponent. Predictably, Owens blew off Balor when the new champion extended his hand in a show of respect. Owens remains embroiled in his feud with John Cena, so does this mean he will not be appearing on NXT programming going forward? It would make sense for his character and for the story that he would want a shot to reclaim the belt, but his program with Cena has been so white hot that it almost doesn't make sense for him to split his time between the developmental brand and the main roster. So will Owens look for revenge on Balor, or will the new NXT Champion begin a program with a new challenger? Last week, Balor and his tag team partner, Samoa Joe, defeated Owens and Rhyno. Joe made a splash when he came after Owens at the conclusion of NXT Takeover: Unstoppable. But where does the indy star go now? Does he feud with Rhyno? Does he make a play for Balor's title? Or does he go in another direction? The women of NXT have been suspiciously quiet recently, though this could have something to do with an impending call up to assist Paige on the main roster in taking out The Bella Twins. Becky Lynch is recovering from an injury she suffered during her classic championship bout with Sasha Banks at Unstoppable, while the champ herself has been seen sparingly since. Will the women be back in action tonight? There also hasn't been any hints as to the next NXT live special, but with Balor as champion, things can start fresh at the top of the brand and trickle down. Let's see what new feuds develop tonight. As always, check back with MStars after the show for a full recap of all the action.

    "DiffbotBody": "Olive Oil Olive oil is an alternative to vegetable oils, including canola, peanut and grapeseed oils, in a cake mix. Olive oil contains healthier monounsaturated fats, which aid in reducing your risk of heart disease and high cholesterol when eaten in moderation. In contrast, vegetable oils containing omega-6 fatty polyunsaturated acids could potentially increase the risks of heart disease. The Fine Cooking website suggests that using pure olive oil rather than extra-virgin to produce a milder, tender cake can also save you money. Dairy Substitutes Angie Thayer, a registered dietitian and food and regulatory specialist for Wilton Brands, recommends substituting oil with dairy products. Reduced-fat products will also assist in reducing overall fat and calorie consumption. Replace every cup of oil with 3/4 cup of a dairy substitute such as yogurt or sour cream. Reduced-fat products may produce a drier, denser mix, so try adding 1 to 2 extra tablespoons to negate this effect.",
    "LabBody": "Cake mixes are a convenient alternative to baking from scratch, saving you time and worry, particularly if homemade baking isn't your forte. Most boxed cake mixes call for two to three extra ingredients including water, eggs and oil, most frequently vegetable oil. Oil serves to bind all the ingredients together in addition to adding extra moisture for a moist, tender cake. You can omit vegetable oil and still produce a tasty, rich cake with other oil and nonoil alternatives. Butter It Up. Substitute butter for vegetable oil when preparing your cake mix. Use an equal amount of butter as you would vegetable oil, or a 1:1 ratio, adding it cup for cup with your mix. Melt the butter prior to mixing it with other ingredients to avoid clumping and ensure smooth, even distribution and texture. Butter makes for a slightly denser cake due to its richness and is ideal for stacked, layered cakes. Produce Puree. Reduce the amount of fat in your cake with veggie and fruit purees. Purees made from produce add moisture to the cake to prevent it from drying out or crumbling apart. You can use various different fruits and veggies as a puree, keeping in mind that the stronger the flavor, the more you will be able to taste it in the baked cake. More frequently used purees include applesauce, banana, pumpkin and sweet potato. Substitute 3/4 to 1 cup of fruit puree and 3/4 of a cup of veggie puree for every cup of vegetable oil called for in the recipe. Olive Oil. Olive oil is an alternative to vegetable oils, including canola, peanut and grapeseed oils, in a cake mix.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s been a rough few weeks for Sarah Palin… Last month, the country was shocked when her daughter Bristol Palin called off her wedding to Sgt. Dakota Meyer just days before it was set to take place amidst claims he had been married to a “secret wife” years before. Weeks later, it was revealed that Bristol is currently pregnant with her second child out of wedlock, and she has no plans to get married anytime soon. In the middle of those scandals, Fox News parted ways with Palin when they decided not to renew her million dollar contract last month. Now, Palin has just quietly announced that she will be shutting down the subscription-based sarahpalinchannel.com just a year after it debuted. According to Mediaite, the site offered exclusive Palin content for an annual subscription fee of $99.95, and they will now be giving a refund for the remainder of the year to all customers. Here’s the full statement the Palins put on the website: Effective August 1st, the Governor will be making all of her content free on her Facebook page and at SarahPac.com. • If you are a monthly subscriber here on SarahPalinChannel.com, you will not be charged anything after this month. There’s nothing that you need to do. • If you are an annual subscriber, you can have the balance of your subscription refunded to your credit card or you can roll your subscription into one of the other channels on our network. If you choose this option, you’ll get an EXTRA month absolutely FREE. Our networks include: – New Life TV – Recharge your relationships and grow closer to God – Alive with Joan Lunden – A vibrant community for women’s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors – K-Love TV – Christian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values Palin also issued a video message in which she did her best to make the change look like a positive thing. “It’s starting August 1st, everything’s free, and just to let you know, that it is an honor to have you subscribe, really it’s been so illuminating and still is so illuminating to read and to respond to many of your insightful comments about current events, about so many things going on in our world today,” Palin said in her video message. She went on to claim that this decision to make all content free stems from a desire to, “make sure that your voices and mine are heard by the widest possible audience across this great land of ours” during the next election. While this sounds nice, it also reveals that Palin was not getting the amount of subscribers she was looking for. She would not be making all the content free if she was making a good amount of money with subscribers, so this change reveals that Palin is not doing as well business-wise as she might have thought. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the entire Palin family. We need to keep them in our prayers!",

    "DiffbotBody": "Commentators are probably right in assessing that Brianna Keilar’s CNN interview with Hillary Clinton was not quite the love-in that many of us anticipated. (See Jim Geraghty’s review of the Clinton interview, here.) Still, you have to mourn the media’s lack of self-respect: as Jim pointed out in Wednesday’s Morning Jolt, Mrs. Clinton blatantly lied when she claimed, “I’ve never had a subpoena” from a congressional committee regarding Benghazi. There was nothing subtle about it. Clinton was totally banking on CNN’s inclination to let her slide. Well, they don’t call it the Clinton News Network for nothing. It is the network of Candy Crowley, who in the middle of a presidential candidates’ debate couldn’t restrain herself from inappropriately challenging – and misleadingly correcting – Mitt Romney’s remarks about Benghazi. But somehow, when Benghazi came up in a one-on-one media interview setting, CNN couldn’t bring itself to call Mrs. Clinton on an obvious lie. It is well known that Mrs. Clinton was subpoenaed in March by the House select committee investigating the Benghazi Massacre. The matter is indisputable. Plus, it was Keilar who brought up the subject of the subpoena, so one has to assume she did a modicum of research – which is all it would have taken to be ready to challenge Clinton’s false assertion. Yet, in the context of being asked about her destruction of emails from her private server, Clinton was permitted to tell the public she had not been subpoenaed. Thus, without impunity, she was able to frame suspicions that she has willfully obstructed probes of the Benghazi Massacre as outlandish. Jim notes that, in March, Chairman Trey Gowdy’s Benghazi committee released a public statement reporting that it had “issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya.” Moreover, we also know that Benghazi Committee Democrats – apparently thinking it would help Mrs. Clinton(!) – publicly released a March 27 letter from Clinton’s counsel, David Kendall, in which the subpoena is acknowledged and analyzed at length. In the letter (which Shannen Coffin discussed here at National Review back in March), Kendall states that the Committee issued a “subpoena duces tecum” – essentially, a subpoena that compels the witness to produce documents. The subpoena demanded production of “documents, for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.” Those would be (a) the eight months before the September 11, 2012, Benghazi Massacre, when security at the State Department compound was reduced despite jihadist attacks and an intensified terrorist threat, and (b) the three-and-a-half months after the attack, when the administration misled the public about the nature of the attack and identity of the attackers while trumping up a prosecution against the producer of the Innocence of Muslims video, on which the administration fraudulently blamed the murders of four Americans. The documents called for by the subpoena are those “referring or relating to” the following for categories: “Libya (including but not limited to Benghazi and Tripoli)”; “Weapons located or found in, imported or brought into, and/or exported or removed from Libya”; “The attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012”; “Statements pertaining to the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 and September 12, 2012.” There is no question that the subpoena was issued to Mrs. Clinton personally. Kendall says it was “issued by the Benghazi Select Committee to the Hon. Hillary R. Clinton.” Furthermore, by mutual agreement between the committee and the Clinton camp, it was served on Mrs. Clinton, apparently by delivery to her agent for that purpose (probably Mr. Kendall’s firm, but the letter doesn’t say). Kendall is Mrs. Clinton’s personal attorney, and his letter states that the subpoena was “served by agreement on March 4, 2015.” Given that Chairman Gowdy is an experienced litigator and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton was represented by counsel, it was consistent with professional ethical rules to arrange delivery of the subpoena – and discuss the subpoena thereafter – with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer. And, of course, Mrs. Clinton is also a lawyer with congressional committee experience – she is well aware that service of process upon a witness’s agent by consensual arrangement with witness’s lawyer is the legal and factual equivalent of personal service on the witness. In addition, it is quite apparent that Kendall could not have written a letter extensively responding to the subpoena requests without first having discussed the subpoena with his client, Mrs. Clinton. When Hillary Clinton told CNN, “I’ve never had a subpoena,” she was lying. Since that is what Mrs. Clinton often does, a reporter who fails to challenge her – in an interview for which the reporter had lots of time to prepare, and on a subject the reporter brought up – must be either incompetent or colluding in the lie. Such collusion might be because the reporter supports the candidate, the reporter and her network want to maintain access the candidate, or both. I don’t think Ms. Keilar is incompetent.",

According to SI, “The 3-month-old stray was malnourished and had an eye infection; he sustained himself by begging for food while staying clear of hotel security.” Jacobellis began to feed the dog scrapes and treats, but she began to fall for the dog and looked into how she could bring him back home to Vermont. Although she didn’t come back with any medals, the snowboarder claims that adopting the dog meant much more to her. “My event didn’t pan out the way I would have liked,” she says in the video, “but it was nice to get something great out of it.” The touching video also showcases Stepan — who plays for the New York Rangers — who looks after a pooch named Jake and Stack, who cares for a dog named Shayba. Please SHARE this heartwarming video, so we can help get more homeless dogs adopted. (Photo credit: Courtesy Gus Kenworthy)",

Answer: Attracting pollinators is a great way to ensure that your garden will set lots of fruit. Planting seasonal food sources for pollinators helps to keep the food supply secure. According to the National Academy of Sciences, close to 75 percent of the flowering plants on Earth rely to some degree on pollinators in order to set seed or fruit. kAm|@DE @7 E96 A=2?ED E92E H6 62E 2D 7@@5 56A6?5 @?

    "DiffbotBody": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A hanging slider from Joakim Soria resulted in another game-ending home run from Brian Dozier that spoiled Justin Verlander's best start of the season. Dozier hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth to cap a seven-run rally and give the Minnesota Twins an 8-6 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Friday night. The Twins scored seven times in the ninth off Soria and Bruce Rondon after being limited to one run by Verlander, who went 7 2-3 innings. \"Feel badly because Verlander threw a nice game and I blew it,\" Soria said. \"It's part of baseball and sometimes the ball goes like that.\" Dozier's RBI single in the eighth chased Verlander, who allowed five hits and struck out six in his fifth start since coming off the disabled list. Eddie Rosario had an RBI single in the ninth, Soria hit Kurt Suzuki with a pitch with the bases loaded and Danny Santana drove in two runs with a single before Dozier's 19th home run of the season. Dozier, who also hit a game-ending homer on Monday against Baltimore, was part of the American League's final player vote for the All-Star game and found out before the game he finished second to Kansas City third baseman Mike Moustakas. \"Dozier's, I was trying to mix it up,\" Soria said. \"Slider and he ended up hitting it out of the ballpark.\" Trevor May (6-7) pitched a scoreless ninth, giving up two hits to start the inning, then getting three popups with runners on first and third. \"That one stunk,\" Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said. \"Can't pout about it. Got another game and we'll come back and go at it again.\" Yoenis Cespedes had three hits, including a three-run homer, for Detroit. Victor Martinez and J.D. Martinez added home runs for the Tigers off Twins starter Ervin Santana. Verlander hasn't been the near-100 mph pitcher from his past since returning from the right triceps strain which knocked him out of the season's first two months. But he kept Minnesota off balance with a breaking ball and a low-to-mid 90s fastball. \"I was executing my pitches much better throughout the course of the game, including the stretch, which is where I kind of lost it in my previous start,\" Verlander said. \"Got to focus on the positives. We've been playing good baseball. Just didn't happen for us tonight.\" COMMUNICATING LATE C Alex Avila made several trips to the mound to talk with Soria in the ninth. Both players said communication issues didn't lead to the collapse. \"As the count goes on, the longer the night there's a guy there on second base, the more times he sees you flashing signs,\" Avila said. \"You just want to make sure.\" CHAMBERLAIN RELEASED A week after designating Joba Chamberlain for assignment, the Tigers gave the right-handed reliever his unconditional release on Friday. Chamberlain was 0-2 with a 4.09 ERA in 30 games in his second season with Detroit after signing a one-year, $1 million contract in the offseason. \"It wouldn't shock me if somebody took a shot at him thinking maybe a change of environment would be good for him,\" Ausmus said.

Get a private inbox, upload your own photo gallery and more. I must be probably one of the few who likely won't. Just see no reason right now, let them fix any problems before I bother upgrading. That and really I want to see some improvements, aside from the marketing fluff they keep pushing. Boot times are negligible for me, since I usually have to check something else. The whole forced update idea is silly at best, especially if updates are requiring a full system restart. Nope! Was using 7 since it was preview like 2008, don't recall really why, probably because had more than 3,5GB of RAM and XPx64 was hopeless. Neccesity really. I've tested out W10 for few hours and doesn't feel like different OS, just reorganised skin with some driver issues. I will probably wait for issues to get addressed, DX12 to get essential, tweaks and apps that imitate XP usability (Classic Explorer), maybe download W10 licence before expiry date, but if not essential still use Win7 (I hope license transfer like this will be possible, but probably M$ and modders will solve most issues before transfer expiry date). Really, the big stopper for me to test Preview was lack of drivers to test it properly on my spare machine. Anyone saying this hasn't been doing their research. Windows 10 is objectively better and faster than Windows 7 in every conceivable way. I will be upgrading on Day 1 - it's better and it's free forever, there is absolutely no reason not to. Just dive in and enjoy, and know that Windows 10 is going to be remembered as fondly as Windows 7 is now. If you don't upgrade, you are limiting yourself to slower boot times and overall performance (Windows 10 uses fewer resources than Windows 7, this is a fact), no DX12, no new file management tools, no Hyper-V, single workspace, etc. Clinging to the past and saying \"Well M$ f'd it up with Win 8 so I'm sticking with 7\" just makes you look stubborn and uninformed. Enjoy your slower, less fully-featured OS I guess.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Every year, the TV landscape gets a little more crowded. There's never been a better time to be a TV viewer, but with so many options, it can also get a little overwhelming. Which TV shows are worth your time? Let The Week be your guide. Read through our list of the most promising shows of the season, and a few new names to your DVR lineup. (We're only including shows with a set release date, and will update the list as other great shows nail down their premiere dates.) 1. Outlander (Starz, April 4) After several misbegotten stabs at period dramas, Starz scored with this buzzy adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's series of historical fantasy novels. Caitriona Balfe stars as a World War II combat nurse who travels back in time to Scotland's civil war in 1743. It might sound a little goofy, but Outlander sells the premise with style, leaping deftly from genre to genre for a story that's not quite like anything else on television. 2. Wolf Hall (PBS, April 5) Hilary Mantel's brilliant novel about the court of King Henry VIII — told from the perspective of his often-maligned advisor Thomas Cromwell — gets a lavish small-screen adaptation. Tony-winning stage actor Mark Rylance stars as Cromwell, leading a cast that includes Homeland's Damian Lewis as King Henry. Wolf Hall's dense reappraisal of British history packs in all the political intrigue of Game of Thrones, and a faithful adaptation should prove no less addictive or hypnotic. 3. Mad Men (AMC, April 5) What's left to be said about Mad Men? AMC's brilliant drama, which centers on a Manhattan advertising firm in the 1960s, has already secured its place among the great shows in television history. Last year's set of episodes, which made up the first half of Mad Men's final season, were some of the best in the show's entire run, and the show's sprawling ensemble cast is as deep (and uniformly excellent) as ever. With just seven episodes left, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to Mad Men, but that's no reason to miss a single second of the show's final hours. 4. Louie (FX, April 9) A justified critical darling, Louie C.K.'s experimental sitcom is one of TV's most unpredictable shows; by playing freely with form and style, C.K. ensures that viewers never know what they're going to see when they tune in. With Louie C.K. serving as creator, writer, director, and star — as well as a host of other jobs — Louie is one of TV's few true auteur projects. Watching an episode is like getting a glimpse into the acerbic comedian's brain. 5. Daredevil (Netflix, April 10) Marvel extends its superheroic empire with the first of four Netflix-exclusive dramas. Charlie Cox stars as Daredevil, a blind superhero who fights crime using his enhanced other senses. (The remaining three shows — centered on Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage — will premiere later, with a miniseries combining all four characters to follow.) Daredevil has a fiercely loyal following among comics fans, but the first major adaptation of his story, which starred Ben Affleck, failed to connect with audiences in 2003. Since then, Marvel has essentially rewritten the book on superhero adaptations, and it's hard to imagine it will botch the opportunity to reintroduce a character with so much potential to mainstream audiences. 6. Game of Thrones (HBO, April 12) Over four seasons, HBO's fantasy drama has achieved the kind of buzz most networks can only dream about, turning once-obscure phrases like \"Winter is Coming\" and \"Red Wedding\" into entrenched cultural catchphrases. Though many of the best moments from George R.R. Martin's novels have already occurred in the TV series, the fifth season of Game of Thrones is likely to be the most sprawling, with fan-favorite characters like Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark scattered across the world. TV shows rarely come more ambitious, or more compulsively watchable, than this. 7. Veep (HBO, April 12) Building on a third season that was easily the show's best, HBO's scathing political satire returns as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Selina Meyer — thrust into the nation's highest office after the unexpected resignation of the president — battles to keep her role in a contentious election. Veep is the ideal political satire for our time: hilarious, profane, and unfailingly committed to the idea that politicians on both sides of the aisle are petty, self-absorbed idiots. 8. Orphan Black (BBC America, April 18) The second season of Orphan Black was a step down from the addictive, propulsive first, but no matter how much it went off the rails, the sci-fi head-scratcher would be worth watching solely on the basis of its star. Over the course of the series, Tatiana Maslany has successfully played more than a dozen separate characters (all clones), and the third season adds a new adversary in a set of male clones (Ari Millen). 9. Happyish (Showtime, April 26) The genesis of Happyish is a sad story: the dramedy originally starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had already filmed the pilot before his sudden death. Those who have seen the originally Happyish pilot have testified to Hoffman's brilliance in the lead role, and while it's a shame that viewers will never get to see him in a recurring TV role, the new version of Happyish — which replaces Hoffman with Steve Coogan — still has plenty of promise. Happyish follows Thom Payne, a middle-aged ad executive who pushes back against a youth-driven culture as he staves off his own sense of irrelevance. 10. Penny Dreadful (Showtime, May 3) Forget Homeland and The Affair — the best series on Showtime is Penny Dreadful. This wonderfully morbid period horror-drama packs in all the best elements of gothic fiction: ornate dialogue, gorgeous locales, a lavish orchestral score, and a never-ending stream of creepy, otherworldly creatures to tempt our heroes into succumbing to their darker sides. Anchored by an unmissable performance from Eva Green and an impressive comeback role for Josh Hartnett, Penny Dreadful is TV's most compelling horror show. 11. Wayward Pines (Fox, May 14) M. Night Shyamalan's offbeat thriller series is so clearly inspired by Twin Peaks that it almost borders on plagiarism — but if you're going to crib, you might as well crib from the best. Matt Dillon stars as a Secret Service agent sent to investigate the disappearance of two fellow agents in a small Idaho town, only to discover that the entire town is a bizarre slice of Americana filled with strange secrets. Based on Shyamalan's recent pedigree and the ludicrous teaser video, Wayward Pines could easily turn out to be a fiasco — but it definitely doesn't look boring. 12. Hannibal (NBC, June 4) Bryan Fuller's arty, gory take on the fictional killer is one of network TV's most unjustly overlooked dramas: gorgeous, strange, and embedded with a tense psychological depth. As Hannibal, Mads Mikkelsen is good enough to make you forget about Anthony Hopkins, and Hugh Dancy is every bit his equal as Will Graham, the troubled FBI profiler whose pursuit of Hannibal brought him to the brink of insanity. 13. Sense8 (Netflix, June 5) The Wachowskis have never equaled the towering, genre-expanding success of The Matrix, but no one can deny the ambition of their follow-up projects. Sense8, their first TV series (in a partnership with Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski), follows eight strangers from across the world who suddenly, inexplicably become mentally and emotionally linked. 14. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (Netflix, July 17) The cultshly adored comedic film — which follows a group of counselors through a surreal series of misadventures at a summer camp — is finally getting its long-discussed prequel in the form of a Netflix limited series. Impressively, the series has managed to assemble pretty much everybody from the movie's insanely stacked cast, including Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Paul Rudd, and Elizabeth Banks. TV shows that have already premiered: (Our original previews for each of these shows were published earlier this year. We've left those curtain-raisers untouched, but appended updates to each item.) 15. Agent Carter (ABC, January 6) After successfully reinvigorating its sophomore drama Agents of S.H.I.E.LD., Marvel is delving into its past with the limited series Agent Carter. The story picks up in the mid-1940s, shortly after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, as Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) embarks on a series of top-secret missions while combating the sexism of the era. This is Marvel's first project centered on a female protagonist, and a look back at the events that set up for blockbusters like Iron Man and The Avengers should provide a fresh and intriguing take on the Marvel universe. UPDATE: Agent Carter's brief run was praised by fans and critics alike, but so-so ratings may spell doom for a second season. ABC hasn't committed one way or the other yet. 16. Empire (Fox, January 7) Terrence Howard leads the gleefully soapy Empire as Lucious Lyon, a hip-hop mogul who must decide how to dispose of his vast fortune when he's diagnosed with ALS. Riffing on both King Lear and The Lion in Winter, Empire proudly wears its serialized ambitions on its sleeve, from an unusually large cast for a network drama (including a scene-stealing role from Taraji P. Henson) to a series of new songs from Timbaland. UPDATE: Empire is an astonishingly massive breakout hit, with ratings increasing week to week for every single one of its episodes — a virtually unprecedented feat in any era of TV, let alone an era with DVR and streaming services. The series will return for a second season. 17. Babylon (SundanceTV, January 8) Danny Boyle's dark satire follows an American public relations whiz (Brit Marling) hired to improve the sagging public image of London's Metropolitan Police Department. It's edgy, well-timed material, and the series wears its ambition on its sleeve, with a massive ensemble cast splitting perspectives between the PR team and the cops. UPDATE: Babylon was a solid performer in the U.K., but never caught on stateside. No word on a second season. 18. Girls (HBO, January 11) Girls' cultural footprint may be larger than its actual viewership, but there's still plenty to admire about Lena Dunham's unique depiction of life and love in your twenties. Season four takes a bold step by shifting the narrative away from Brooklyn, as Hannah Horvath (Dunham) begins a program at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. (Don't worry — the rest of the cast, including Adam Driver and Allison Williams, are staying put.) UPDATE: Girls' ratings have more or less plateaued — after four seasons, you probably know if you're a fan or not. The fourth season made bold choices by splitting up its protagonists into distinct narratives, and a flash-forward in the finale indicates that the schism will continue. The series has already been renewed for a fifth season. 19. Shameless (Showtime, January 11) For four seasons, Showtime's underappreciated dramedy has followed the ups and downs of the blue-collar Gallagher family, led by the deadbeat patriarch Frank (William H. Macy). Season five picks up shortly after Fiona (Emmy Rossum), the most responsible member of the family, is released from prison, getting back to life as usual as she sorts through her family's various dysfunctions. UPDATE: Shameless continues to quietly amass buzz and acclaim, with William H. Macy's lead performance winning a Screen Actors Guild Award in January. The series has been renewed for a sixth season. 20. Togetherness (HBO, January 11) The Duplass brothers take their talents to television for this warm dramedy about a pair of middle-aged couples attempting to put their lives in order. Unlike most of what ends up on television, there's no big hook for Togetherness; just a group of genial actors, including Mark Duplass and Amanda Peet, digging into their likably messy characters as they navigate life in Los Angeles. UPDATE: As Togetherness unrolled its narrative, it got darker, culminating in a cliffhanger that threatens the future of its central couple. Fortunately, viewers won't need to wait too long for resolution, as the series has been renewed for a second season. 21. Parks \u0026 Recreation (NBC, January 13) Following similarly beloved shows like 30 Rock and The Office into that good night, NBC's last truly brilliant sitcom ends its run with a final string of episodes that were teased in a flash-forward at the end of season six. Expect the show's final 13 episodes to serve as an extended love letter to the well-drawn characters and brilliant cast, from the relentlessly positive Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) to internet favorite Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) — as well as some intriguing new characters, like a hapless employee played by Jon Hamm. UPDATE: After seven seasons, Parks \u0026 Recreation ended its run with a string of terrific episodes, culminating in a series of flash-forwards revealing what happens to the characters years (and sometimes decades) after the series ends. 22. Broad City (Comedy Central, January 14) Comedy Central's wonderfully loopy series returns for a second season, as Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson navigate the travails of living in New York in your twenties. Aside from its two enormously appealing leads, Broad City's brilliance is in its elasticity; the series has no problem diverting from reality for any number of fantastical asides, offering scene after scene full of hilarious and unexpected turns. UPDATE: Broad City was even stronger in its sophomore season, netting universally positive reviews and an ever-growing roster of devoted viewers. The series will return for a third season. 23. The Fall (Netflix, January 16) It's been a long, long wait to see the next chapter in the chilling serial killer drama, but The Fall is finally set to pick up at the end of the first season's cliffhanger. Gillian Anderson stars as a police inspector on the trail of a sociopathic killer (Jamie Dornan, soon to debut as Fifty Shades of Grey's Christian Grey). The entire second season drops on Netflix on January 16, so set your binge-watching schedules accordingly. UPDATE: The Fall's second season was a hit abroad, and Netflix's unquenchable thirst for exclusive programs means it will always have a home in the United States. The series will return for a third season. 24. 12 Monkeys (Syfy, January 16) Nearly 20 years after its premiere, Terry Gilliam's cultishly beloved sci-fi movie makes its way to the small screen, with X-Men alum Aaron Stanford stepping in for Bruce Willis in the main role. Stanford stars as James Cole, a time traveler sent back to prevent the terroristic release of a virus that will kill the vast majority of the world's population. It's going to be tough to live up to the dark vision of the original movie, but the basic premise of 12 Monkeys offers more than enough story for a TV series to expand upon. UPDATE: 12 Monkeys proved divisive with critics, but SyFy was confident enough about the series' long-term appeal to order a second season, set to air sometime in 2016. 25. The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore (Comedy Central, January 19) Occupying the post-Daily Show slot once held by The Colbert Report, The Nightly Show promotes The Daily Show's longstanding \"Senior Black Correspondent\" to the host of his own series. It's safe to expect The Nightly Show to have a format similar to its sister series, but Wilmore is as distinctive and promising a host as Stephen Colbert was when The Colbert Report premiered in 2005. UPDATE: The Nightly Show still has some kinks to work out, but Wilmore has proven himself a worthy successor to Colbert — and with Jon Stewart scheduled to retire from The Daily Show, Comedy Central is lucky to have an experienced and reliable anchor for its sister show. 26. Justified (FX, January 20) The books and stories of Elmore Leonard have long been among Hollywood's favorite sources of adaptation — but there's never been anything as impressive as Justified, which successfully improves upon Leonard's original conception of U.S. marshal Raylan Givens, who appeared in several of his novels. Timothy Olyphant gets top billing, but he's equaled by Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder, a grandiose, speechifying criminal who serves as Raylan's greatest threat and occasional ally. This is Justified's final season, and the series — which has never been afraid of a high body count — is likely to go out with a bang. UPDATE: Justified's final season has been one of its all-time best — a twisty, top-notch crime story bringing many of the show's most beloved characters back for one last goodbye. The series ends on April 14. 27. The Americans (FX, January 28) FX's thrilling Cold War drama, often described as the best show nobody's watching, deserves every bit of critical acclaim that's been thrown at it. Real-life couple Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as a pair of deeply embedded Russian spies living as a married couple just outside of Washington, D.C. The Americans has the darkness and moral complexity to stand up alongside TV's best dramas, and the nail-biting tension of its twisty narrative only stands to increase in its third season. UPDATE: The Americans' ratings haven't improved, but its critical accolades have never been higher. No word on a fourth season yet; if you're not already watching, tune in to help save one of the great dramas of the past few years from getting prematurely canceled. 28. Fortitude (Pivot, January 29) You can't change the channel without finding a grim drama focused on a murder mystery, but there are promising signs that Fortitude will be a cut above your standard entry in the genre. Stanley Tucci stars as a detective who travels to a tiny Arctic community to solve a vicious and mysterious murder, leading a cast that also includes English acting luminaries like Michael Gambon and Christopher Eccleston. UPDATE: Fortitude is weirder and more sprawling than its initial episodes might have indicated, using both Stanley Tucci and the frozen setting to hypnotic effect. No word on a second season yet. 29. Better Call Saul (AMC, February 8) It's been more than a year since Walter White cooked his last batch of crystal meth, and AMC is returning to the world of Breaking Bad with Better Call Saul, a prequel series following the shady lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk in the original series. Messing with the history of a show as revered as Breaking Bad is a tricky prospect, but it's also an intriguing one — and while Walter White and Jesse Pinkman aren't slated to appear, viewers will be thrilled to see the return of fan-favorite character Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks). UPDATE: Better Call Saul doesn't have the relentless narrative momentum of Breaking Bad, and the overarching story feels unfocused, but Bob Odenkirk's lead performance is more than enough reason to tune in. The series is a huge hit, boasting the highest-rated premiere for a scripted series in cable history, and a second season will air in 2016. 30. The Walking Dead (AMC, February 8) Coming off a half-season that finally — finally — lived up to The Walking Dead's promise, the zombie drama returns for another batch of episodes following Rick Grimes and Co. Picking up after a tragic death in the midseason finale, the survivors continue their desperate trek to safety. UPDATE: The Walking Dead's latest season continues, like its titular zombies, to lurch right along. The show's massive success meant that AMC renewed it for a sixth season all the way back in October 2014; a spin-off, set in Los Angeles, is also on the way. 31. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix, March 6) Tina Fey co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which tells the story of a young woman (Ellie Kemper) who leaves a doomsday cult to start a new life in New York City. It's an offbeat premise for a sitcom, which is part of the reason that Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has had an unusually bumpy path to its premiere. The series was originally supposed to debut a 13-episode first season on NBC this spring, but in a complex series of maneuvers, the network ceded the sitcom to Netflix, which picked up two full seasons on the spot. Let's hope it's a better fit for Kimmy Schmidt, which always seemed a little too quirky for NBC primetime. UPDATE: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is terrific — hilarious, unique, and compulsively binge-watchable. Netflix hasn't set a premiere date for the second season, but it can't come soon enough. 32. Community (Yahoo! Screen, March 17) It is almost unbelievable that Community has survived to its sixth season. The cultishly adored sitcom, which follows an offbeat group of students attending a community college, has weathered storm after storm: perpetually low ratings, the firing of its showrunner, the re-hiring of its showrunner, and the departures of numerous cast members (including three who were there from the pilot). Community's latest hurdle came last year, with an outright cancelation from NBC. It seemed like fans would be denied their often-cited wish for #sixseasonsandamovie when a last-minute reprieve came from an unlikely source: Yahoo! Screen, a fledgling video service that acquired that exclusive rights to the show's sixth season. To make up for cast departures, the new season of Community will introduce several new characters, including two new regulars played by Paget Brewster and Keith David. UPDATE: The move to Yahoo! Screen hasn't changed the basic tone and style of Community — if you liked the show's previous seasons, you'll feel right at home here. No word on the show's long-term future, but it's hard to imagine the show going six seasons without getting its movie. 33. iZombie (The CW, March 27) Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas returns to The CW with an even less conventional take on the murder mystery. Rose McIver stars as Liv Moore, a coroner who happens to be a zombie (albeit one who's mostly in control of her cravings). Liv discovers that by eating the brains of the murder victims that pass through her office, she can partially recall their memories, enabling her to help in solving crimes. The zombie genre may be overstuffed, but iZombie is certainly a unique take on the material, and Veronica Mars has earned Rob Thomas more than enough goodwill to roll the dice on his latest project. UPDATE: Just one episode has aired, but iZombie is a charmer, pivoting a unique hook and a likable lead actress into a successful launch. We'll see if the series can hold onto its audience in the weeks to come. 34. Bloodline (Netflix, March 20) The creators of FX's Damages take their twisty sensibilities to Netflix for Bloodline, which chronicles the rift that develops in a family when its prodigal son returns. Details about the series have been scarce, but the top-notch cast — including Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, and Sissy Spacek — is more than enough to make Bloodline worth a look. UPDATE: Only the most dedicated viewers will have binge-watched all 13 episodes of the Netflix drama over the weekend of its premiere, but reviews have been largely positive (if not a little muted). No word on a second season yet.",
    "LabBody": "August 17, 2015. Every year, the TV landscape gets a little more crowded. There's never been a better time to be a TV viewer, but with so many options, it can also get a little overwhelming. Which TV shows are worth your time? Let The Week be your guide. Read through our list of the most promising shows of the season, and add a few new names to your DVR lineup. (We're only including shows with a set release date, and will update the list as other great shows nail down their premiere dates.) 1. Show Me a Hero (HBO, August 16) David Simon — best known as the creator of The Wire and Treme — returns to HBO once again for the miniseries Show Me a Hero, which offers a fictionalized take on a real-life public housing dispute that began in Yonkers, New York, in the late 1980s. The cast, which includes Oscar Isaac, Alfred Molina, and Winona Ryder, is terrific, and no one is as adept at mining highly politicized issues for drama as Simon is. 2. Blunt Talk (Starz, August 22) More than 20 years after Star Trek: The Next Generation finished its run, Patrick Stewart is finally returning to headline another American TV series. Stewart plays Walter Blunt, a newscaster forced to rebuild his credibility after he's arrested while driving drunk with a prostitute. Created by Jonathan Ames, who previously ran HBO's Bored to Death, Blunt Talk offers the same distinctive mix of debauchery and pathos. 3. Fear the Walking Dead (AMC, August 23) How much Walking Dead is too much Walking Dead? AMC is gambling that the massive, loyal audience that has turned the zombie series into cable's biggest hit will be hungry for this \"companion series,\" which tells an all-new story within the same universe. In addition to a new cast and a Los Angeles setting, Fear the Walking Dead will take place at the beginning of the zombie outbreak, giving fans greater insight into the societal collapse that was merely implied in the original series. 4. Narcos (Netflix, August 28) Netflix's latest original drama offers a fictionalized take on the rise of Pablo Escobar's Medellin drug cartel, as told from the perspective of both Escobar (Elite Squad's Wagner Moura) and a DEA agent tasked with capturing him (Game of Thrones' Pedro Pascal). The story of Escobar's rise and fall is as bloody and dramatic as anything you'd find in fiction, and the 10-episode series will have the opportunity to chronicle it in painstaking detail. 5. Drunk History (Comedy Central, September 1) Comedy Central's unique cocktail of alcohol, comedy, and history goes down as smoothly as anything on television. The concept is simple: Host Derek Waters invites comedians to recount their favorite stories from American history, while gently goading them into drinking as much as possible. Their sloshed ramblings are then performed as historical re-enactions by a cast of big-name actors and comedians. The upcoming third season will highlight American cities like Las Vegas and New Orleans. 6. You're the Worst (FXX, September 2) Hailed by many critics as the best sitcom of 2014 — and without question the raunchiest — You're the Worst follows a pair of self-absorbed Angelenos (Aya Cash and Chris Geere) who begin a tumultuous relationship after a one-night stand. You're the Worst has earned praise and a devoted group of viewers by fearlessly relying on the inherent likability of its two leads while depicting them at, well, their worst. 7. Late Show with Stephen Colbert (CBS, September 8) The longtime host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report takes over the late-night chair that was vacated by David Letterman in May. There are a lot of questions left to be answered about Colbert's move to mainstream late-night: How much will he break from Late Show's conventional format? And how will viewers respond to seeing Colbert outside of the \"Stephen Colbert\" character he played so successfully? But whatever form the new Late Show takes, Colbert is a quick-thinking and engaging entertainer, and it'll be a blast to have him in a regular TV slot again. 8. The Mindy Project (Hulu, September 15) To the great relief of its small but passionate group of fans, Hulu swooped in to save this perennially low-rated sitcom just a week after Fox cancelled it. Though The Mindy Project will now be a streaming-only series, creator and star Mindy Kaling has promised a relatively seamless transition: The all-new fourth season will consist of 26 episodes, parceled out once a week, just as they would be on a conventional network. 9. The Bastard Executioner (FX, September 15) FX takes a crack at its very own Game of Thrones with The Bastard Executioner, a medieval-themed series from Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter, starring newcomer Lee Jones as the titular knight-turned-executioner. Sutter has a well-earned reputation for excess, but his over-the-top style might well prove to be a perfect fit for this brutal, blood-drenched take on life in the 14th century. 10. Blindspot (NBC, September 21) NBC's new action/drama is as high-concept as it gets: A woman (Jaimie Alexander) wakes up nude, covered in tattoos, in the middle of Times Square, with no idea who she is or how she got there. Series creators Martin Gero and Greg Berlanti have invited comparisons to The Bourne Identity, which offered similar spy-fi thrills, and Alexander is a magnetic actress who's long overdue for a mainstream breakthrough. 11. The Muppets (ABC, September 22) After the terrific success of the 2011 film The Muppets (and the relative disappoint of its sequel, Muppets Most Wanted), the Muppets are heading back to primetime. The new TV series takes a novel approach to the familiar characters, aping the mockumentary style of The Office and Parks \u0026 Recreation to offer a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at the lives of Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and the rest. 12. Limitless (CBS, September 22) A kind of small-screen sequel to the 2011 thriller of the same name, Limitless stars American Sniper's James McDorman as a regular joe whose life is upended when he takes the miracle drug NZT, which allows its users to unlock the full potential of their brains. Bradley Cooper, who starred in the original Limitless, is slated to make occasional appearances, and the dumb-but-fun premise should offer a unique wrinkle on the well-worn genre. 13. black-ish (ABC, September 23) Kenya Barris' acclaimed sitcom, which follows a wealthy black family navigating the racial, cultural, and political lines of modern-day America, returns for a second season. There are few shows that tackle these issues in any way — let alone with so much humor — and black-ish's talented cast, which includes Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Laurence Fishburne, pulls it off with depth and style. 14. Empire (Fox, September 23) Terrence Howard leads the gleefully soapy Empire as Lucious Lyon, a hip-hop mogul who must decide how to dispose of his vast fortune when he's diagnosed with ALS. Riffing on both King Lear and The Lion in Winter, Empire proudly wears its serialized ambitions on its sleeve, from an unusually large cast for a network drama (including a scene-stealing role from Taraji P. Henson) to a series of new songs from Timbaland. The second season ups the count from 12 episodes to 18, offering even more chances to pile on soapy twists. 15. Heroes Reborn (NBC, September 24) After briefly capturing the zeitgeist with its buzzy first season in 2006, NBC's Heroes crashed hard with goofy, convoluted plotting and needlessly grim characters. But the core concept, which follows a group of people across the world who discover they have superpowers, is still compelling — and this 13-episode sequel series promises to return to the roots of what made Heroes such an out-of-the-box success in the first place. 16. The Last Man on Earth (Fox, September 27) Even the best sitcoms tend to obsess over the same basic subjects — work, friends, family, and dating. That's why the first season of The Last Man on Earth was such a breath of fresh air: By following Phil Miller (Will Forte), one of the only survivors of a post-apocalyptic event, the series grounded its character-driven comedy in a truly unique situation. The second season picks up where the first left off, as Phil contends with the irritations of daily life in an increasingly crowded post-apocalypse. 17. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah (Comedy Central, September 28) South African comedian Trevor Noah takes over the Daily Show anchor chair previously occupied by Jon Stewart — and given the cultish devotion Stewart amassed during his 16 years on The Daily Show, Noah has a big job ahead of him. The scrutiny brought on by the new gig has already led to controversy over Noah's old jokes, but it's not like Jon Stewart emerged fully-formed, either, and Noah's unique perspective on American culture offers plenty of opportunity for a fresh spin on The Daily Show's well-worn format. 18. The Grinder (Fox, September 29) In a meta tweak on his real-life persona, Rob Lowe stars in The Grinder as Dean Sanderson, an actor best known for playing a hotshot lawyer on a TV series titled The Grinder. When the series ends, Sanderson returns to his hometown and joins his family's actual law firm — to the chagrin of his lawyer brother Stewart (Fred Savage), whose actual legal career has been overshadowed by his famous brother's fictional one. 19. The Leftovers (HBO, October 4) HBO's polarizing drama — which takes place in a world reeling from a rapture-like event that saw the inexplicable disappearance of two percent of the world's population — returns for its sophomore run. Showrunner Damon Lindelof has promised a more streamlined and plot-driven second season, as the Garvey family heads to a Texas suburb that was inexplicably spared from the sudden disappearance of its citizens. 20. Homeland (Showtime, October 4) It's been a rough few years for Homeland, which has seen steady erosion from the massive critical acclaim of its first season after misguided creative choices and goofy plot twists. Still, Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin's performances remain as impressive as ever, and the new season — which jumps ahead two years and moves the story to Berlin — is a chance for a quasi-reboot that could bring Homeland back to previous glories. 21. iZombie (The CW, October 6) Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas' iZombie offers an even less conventional take on the murder mystery. Rose McIver stars as Liv Moore, a coroner who happens to be a zombie (albeit one who's mostly in control of her cravings). Liv discovers that by eating the brains of the murder victims that pass through her office, she can partially recall their memories, enabling her to help in solving crimes. The zombie genre may be overstuffed, but iZombie is one of the most unique and engaging evolutions yet. 22. Red Oaks (Amazon, October 9) Amazon's promising new comedy series riffs on the coming-of-age comedies of the '80s with the story of a college kid (Submarine's Craig Roberts) who spends his summer working at a country club in 1985. Directed by Pineapple Express' David Gordon Green and featuring talented, underutilized actors like Paul Reiser and Jennifer Grey, Red Oaks is one of the stronger pilots to emerge from Amazon's ongoing attempt to launch a full slate of original shows. 23. American Horror Story: Hotel (FX, October 10) Like pretty much anything by Glee creator Ryan Murphy, American Horror Story is maddeningly inconsistent — but even at its worst, there's nothing else that's quite like it. For its fifth season, Murphy has promised more actual horror than last year's campy Freak Show, with a slew of returning cast members and an extremely buzzy new role for Lady Gaga, playing the owner of the titular hotel. 24. The Walking Dead (AMC, October 11) The Walking Dead continues, like its titular zombies, to lurch right along; the show's massive ratings scored it a sixth-season renewal all the way back in October 2014. The new season will follow the survivors as they settle into Alexandria, a \"safe zone\" in Virginia, with new allies and enemies on the horizon. 25. Fargo (FX, October 12) For its second season, FX's terrific anthology drama rewinds the clock to 1979, delving into the \"Sioux Falls massacre\" that was briefly teased in conversation in season one. The all-new cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Ted Danson, and Patrick Wilson, playing the younger version of the character originated by Keith Carradine in season one. 26. Manhattan (WGN America, October 13) Following a stellar first season, Manhattan — which follows the group of Los Alamos scientists tasked with building the atomic bomb at the height of World War II — returns for its sophomore season. Gorgeous, complex, and beautifully acted, this period drama cements WGN America as a go-to channel for fans of top-tier original dramas. 27. The Knick (Cinemax, October 16) Steven Soderbergh's eccentric period drama, which follows a brilliant surgeon (Clive Owen) at a New York hospital in 1900, returns for another year. Bleak, grisly, and brutal, The Knick can be a hard show to watch, but its exploration of a little-discussed time and place in American history remains darkly mesmerizing. 28. Supergirl (CBS, October 26) Superman's cousin Kara (Glee's Melissa Benoist) dons her own red cape in Supergirl. It would be an understatement to say that superheroes haven't always worked on the small screen, but Benoist is perfectly suited for the role, and creator Greg Berlanti — whose other shows include the CW's Arrow and The Flash — has certainly proven adept at this kind of material before. 29. Ash vs. Evil Dead (Starz, October 31) More than 20 years after Army of Darkness, Bruce Campbell picks up his boomstick again for Ash vs. Evil Dead, the first TV installment in Sam Raimi's beloved horror-comedy series. The presence of Raimi and Campbell — as well as the anything-goes approach offered by a premium network like Starz — offer more than enough reasons to watch, but Ash vs. Evil Dead also offers a pair of intriguing new sidekicks in Jill Marie Jones and Ray Santiago. 30. Flesh and Bone (Starz, November 8) Breaking Bad alum Moira Walley-Beckett launches her own series with Flesh and Bone, a harrowing drama set in the world of ballet. Relying on professional dancers like Irina Dvorovenko and Sascha Radetsky for maximum authenticity, Flesh and Bone promises to do for dancing ballet what Breaking Bad did for cooking meth. 31. Into the Badlands (AMC, November 15) With its premiere months away, AMC's martial arts drama is still largely shrouded in mystery — but the ambition and scope is certainly intriguing. Danny Wu stars as Sunny, a warrior escorting a young boy across dangerous territory, in a story loosely based on the 1592 novel Journey to the West, which is widely regarded as one of China's greatest novels. 32. The Man in the High Castle (Amazon, November 20) Amazon's bold and ambitious alternate history series, which is based on the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name, is set in a world where the Axis won World War II, dividing the United States into two large territories controlled by Germany and Japan. It's an unsettling, enormously elastic premise that allows for essentially infinite stories, exploring the full ramifications of a vastly different world. TV shows that have already premiered: (Our original previews for each of these shows were published earlier this year. We've left those curtain-raisers untouched, but appended updates to each item.) 33. Agent Carter (ABC, January 6) After successfully reinvigorating its sophomore drama Agents of S.H.I.E.LD., Marvel is delving into its past with the limited series Agent Carter. The story picks up in the mid-1940s, shortly after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, as Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) embarks on a series of top-secret missions while combating the sexism of the era. This is Marvel's first project centered on a female protagonist, and a look back at the events that set up for blockbusters like Iron Man and The Avengers should provide a fresh and intriguing take on the Marvel universe. UPDATE: Agent Carter's brief run was praised by fans and critics alike, and despite so-so ratings, ABC is bringing it back for a second season, to premiere in 2016. 34. Babylon (SundanceTV, January 8) Danny Boyle's dark satire follows an American public relations whiz (Brit Marling) hired to improve the sagging public image of London's Metropolitan Police Department. It's edgy, well-timed material, and the series wears its ambition on its sleeve, with a massive ensemble cast splitting perspectives between the PR team and the cops. UPDATE: Babylon was a solid performer in the U.K., but never caught on stateside. It will not return for a second season. 35. Girls (HBO, January 11) Girls' cultural footprint may be larger than its actual viewership, but there's still plenty to admire about Lena Dunham's unique depiction of life and love in your twenties. Season four takes a bold step by shifting the narrative away from Brooklyn, as Hannah Horvath (Dunham) begins a program at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. (Don't worry — the rest of the cast, including Adam Driver and Allison Williams, are staying put.) UPDATE: Girls' ratings have more or less plateaued — after four seasons, you probably know if you're a fan or not. The fourth season made bold choices by splitting up its protagonists into distinct narratives, and a flash-forward in the finale indicates that the schism will continue. The series will return for a fifth season in 2016. 36. Shameless (Showtime, January 11) For four seasons, Showtime's underappreciated dramedy has followed the ups and downs of the blue-collar Gallagher family, led by the deadbeat patriarch Frank (William H. Macy). Season five picks up shortly after Fiona (Emmy Rossum), the most responsible member of the family, is released from prison, getting back to life as usual as she sorts through her family's various dysfunctions. UPDATE: Shameless continues to quietly amass buzz and acclaim, with William H. Macy's lead performance winning a Screen Actors Guild Award in January. The series will return for a sixth season, to premiere in January 2016. 37. Togetherness (HBO, January 11) The Duplass brothers take their talents to television for this warm dramedy about a pair of middle-aged couples attempting to put their lives in order. Unlike most of what ends up on television, there's no big hook for Togetherness; just a group of genial actors, including Mark Duplass and Amanda Peet, digging into their likably messy characters as they navigate life in Los Angeles. UPDATE: As Togetherness unrolled its narrative, it got darker, culminating in a cliffhanger that threatens the future of its central couple. Fortunately, viewers won't need to wait too long for resolution, as the series has been renewed for a second season (though a premiere date hasn't been set). 38. Parks \u0026 Recreation (NBC, January 13) Following similarly beloved shows like 30 Rock and The Office into that good night, NBC's last truly brilliant sitcom ends its run with a final string of episodes that were teased in a flash-forward at the end of season six. Expect the show's final 13 episodes to serve as an extended love letter to the well-drawn characters and brilliant cast, from the relentlessly positive Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) to internet favorite Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) — as well as some intriguing new characters, like a hapless employee played by Jon Hamm. UPDATE: After seven seasons, Parks \u0026 Recreation ended its run with a string of terrific episodes, culminating in a series of flash-forwards revealing the ultimate fates of its characters. 39. Broad City (Comedy Central, January 14) Comedy Central's wonderfully loopy series returns for a second season, as Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson navigate the travails of living in New York in your twenties. Aside from its two enormously appealing leads, Broad City's brilliance is in its elasticity; the series has no problem diverting from reality for any number of fantastical asides, offering scene after scene full of hilarious and unexpected turns. UPDATE: Broad City was even stronger in its sophomore season, netting universally positive reviews and an ever-growing roster of devoted viewers. The series will return for a third season, set to premiere in 2016. 40. The Fall (Netflix, January 16) It's been a long, long wait to see the next chapter in the chilling serial killer drama, but The Fall is finally set to pick up at the end of the first season's cliffhanger. Gillian Anderson stars as a police inspector on the trail of a sociopathic killer (Jamie Dornan, soon to debut as Fifty Shades of Grey's Christian Grey). The entire second season drops on Netflix on January 16, so set your binge-watching schedules accordingly. UPDATE: The Fall's second season was a hit abroad, and Netflix's unquenchable thirst for exclusive programs means it will always have a home in the United States. The series will return for a third and final season, set to air sometime in 2016. 41. 12 Monkeys (Syfy, January 16) Nearly 20 years after its premiere, Terry Gilliam's cultishly beloved sci-fi movie makes its way to the small screen, with X-Men alum Aaron Stanford stepping in for Bruce Willis in the main role. Stanford stars as James Cole, a time traveler sent back to prevent the terroristic release of a virus that will kill the vast majority of the world's population. It's going to be tough to live up to the dark vision of the original movie, but the basic premise of 12 Monkeys offers more than enough story for a TV series to expand upon. UPDATE: 12 Monkeys proved divisive with critics, but SyFy was confident enough about the series' long-term appeal to order a second season, set to air sometime in 2016. 42. The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore (Comedy Central, January 19) Occupying the post-Daily Show slot once held by The Colbert Report, The Nightly Show promotes The Daily Show's longstanding \"Senior Black Correspondent\" to the host of his own series. It's safe to expect The Nightly Show to have a format similar to its sister series, but Wilmore is as distinctive and promising a host as Stephen Colbert was when The Colbert Report premiered in 2005. UPDATE: The Nightly Show still has some kinks to work out, but Wilmore has proven himself a worthy successor to Colbert — and with Jon Stewart retiring from The Daily Show, Comedy Central is lucky to have an experienced and reliable anchor for its sister show. 43. Justified (FX, January 20) The books and stories of Elmore Leonard have long been among Hollywood's favorite sources of adaptation — but there's never been anything as impressive as Justified, which successfully improves upon Leonard's original conception of U.S. marshal Raylan Givens, who appeared in several of his novels. Timothy Olyphant gets top billing, but he's equaled by Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder, a grandiose, speechifying criminal who serves as Raylan's greatest threat and occasional ally. This is Justified's final season, and the series — which has never been afraid of a high body count — is likely to go out with a bang. UPDATE: Justified's final season was one of its all-time best — a twisty, top-notch crime story bringing many of the show's most beloved characters back for one last goodbye. The series ended with a pitch-perfect finale on April 14, 2015. 44. The Americans (FX, January 28) FX's thrilling Cold War drama, often described as the best show nobody's watching, deserves every bit of critical acclaim that's been thrown at it. Real-life couple Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys star as a pair of deeply embedded Russian spies living as a married couple just outside of Washington, D.C. The Americans has the darkness and moral complexity to stand up alongside TV's best dramas, and the nail-biting tension of its twisty narrative only stands to increase in its third season. UPDATE: The Americans' ratings haven't improved, but its critical accolades have never been higher. The series will return for a fourth season in 2016. 45. Fortitude (Pivot, January 29) You can't change the channel without finding a grim drama focused on a murder mystery, but there are promising signs that Fortitude will be a cut above your standard entry in the genre. Stanley Tucci stars as a detective who travels to a tiny Arctic community to solve a vicious and mysterious murder, leading a cast that also includes English acting luminaries like Michael Gambon and Christopher Eccleston. UPDATE: Fortitude was weirder and more sprawling than its initial episodes might have indicated, using its frozen setting to hypnotic effect. A second season has been ordered, though no premiere date has been set. 46. Better Call Saul (AMC, February 8) It's been more than a year since Walter White cooked his last batch of crystal meth, and AMC is returning to the world of Breaking Bad with Better Call Saul, a prequel series following the shady lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk in the original series. Messing with the history of a show as revered as Breaking Bad is a tricky prospect, but it's also an intriguing one — and while Walter White and Jesse Pinkman aren't slated to appear, viewers will be thrilled to see the return of fan-favorite character Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks). UPDATE: Better Call Saul didn't have the relentless narrative momentum of Breaking Bad, and the overarching story felt unfocused, but Bob Odenkirk's lead performance was more than enough reason to tune in. The series is a huge hit, boasting the highest-rated premiere for a scripted series in cable history, and a second season will air in 2016. 47. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix, March 6) Tina Fey co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which tells the story of a young woman (Ellie Kemper) who leaves a doomsday cult to start a new life in New York City. It's an offbeat premise for a sitcom, which is part of the reason that Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has had an unusually bumpy path to its premiere. The series was originally supposed to debut a 13-episode first season on NBC this spring, but in a complex series of maneuvers, the network ceded the sitcom to Netflix, which picked up two full seasons on the spot. Let's hope it's a better fit for Kimmy Schmidt, which always seemed a little too quirky for NBC primetime. UPDATE: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was terrific — hilarious, unique, and compulsively binge-watchable. Netflix hasn't set a premiere date for the second season, but it can't come soon enough. 48. Community (Yahoo! Screen, March 17) It is almost unbelievable that Community has survived to its sixth season. The cultishly adored sitcom, which follows an offbeat group of students attending a community college, has weathered storm after storm: perpetually low ratings, the firing of its showrunner, the re-hiring of its showrunner, and the departures of numerous cast members (including three who were there from the pilot). Community's latest hurdle came last year, with an outright cancelation from NBC. It seemed like fans would be denied their often-cited wish for #sixseasonsandamovie when a last-minute reprieve came from an unlikely source: Yahoo! Screen, a fledgling video service that acquired that exclusive rights to the show's sixth season. To make up for cast departures, the new season of Community will introduce several new characters, including two new regulars played by Paget Brewster and Keith David. UPDATE: The move to Yahoo! Screen didn't change the basic tone and style of Community — if you liked the show's previous seasons, you'll like this too. The series won't return for a seventh season, but it's hard to imagine Community going six seasons without getting its movie. 49. Bloodline (Netflix, March 20) The creators of FX's Damages take their twisty sensibilities to Netflix for Bloodline, which chronicles the rift that develops in a family when its prodigal son returns. Details about the series have been scarce, but the top-notch cast — including Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, and Sissy Spacek — is more than enough to make Bloodline worth a look. UPDATE: Dedicated viewers who binge-watched all 13 episodes of the well-received Netflix drama will have another season to devour; Bloodline will return for a second outing in 2016. 50. Outlander (Starz, April 4) After several misbegotten stabs at period dramas, Starz scored with this buzzy adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's series of historical fantasy novels. Caitriona Balfe stars as a World War II combat nurse who travels back in time to Scotland's civil war in 1743. It might sound a little goofy, but Outlander sells the premise with style, leaping deftly from genre to genre for a story that's not quite like anything else on television. UPDATE: The back half of Outlander's first season didn't live up to the initial run of episodes, but the show's fans remain as loyal as ever. A second season has been ordered, though no premiere date has been set. 51. Wolf Hall (PBS, April 5) Hilary Mantel's brilliant novel about the court of King Henry VIII — told from the perspective of his often-maligned advisor Thomas Cromwell — gets a lavish small-screen adaptation. Tony-winning stage actor Mark Rylance stars as Cromwell, leading a cast that includes Homeland's Damian Lewis as King Henry. Wolf Hall's dense reappraisal of British history packs in all the political intrigue of Game of Thrones, and a faithful adaptation should prove no less addictive or hypnotic. UPDATE: Between a deep, talented cast and an intelligently streamlined take on the story, Wolf Hall offered a top-notch take on Mantel's novels. The only complaint is that the series spanned just six episodes. With any luck, when Mantel publishes her third and final Cromwell novel, The Mirror and the Light, Wolf Hall's cast will reassemble to complete the story. 52. Mad Men (AMC, April 5) What's left to be said about Mad Men? AMC's brilliant drama, which centers on a Manhattan advertising firm in the 1960s, has already secured its place among the great shows in television history. Last year's set of episodes, which made up the first half of Mad Men's final season, were some of the best in the show's entire run, and the show's sprawling ensemble cast is as deep (and uniformly excellent) as ever. With just seven episodes left, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to Mad Men, but that's no reason to miss a single second of the show's final hours. UPDATE: Mad Men's final batch of episodes didn't miss a step, offering a moving and fitting end to the show's many stories. And the instantly iconic final shot of Don Draper offered an intriguing kind of television Rorschach Test, ensuring that viewers will continue to debate Mad Men's ultimate message for years to come. 53. Louie (FX, April 9) A justified critical darling, Louie C.K.'s experimental sitcom is one of TV's most unpredictable shows; by playing freely with form and style, C.K. ensures that viewers never know what they're going to see when they tune in. With Louie C.K. serving as creator, writer, director, and star — as well as a host of other jobs — Louie is one of TV's few true auteur projects. Watching an episode is like getting a glimpse into the acerbic comedian's brain. UPDATE: Unfortunately, C.K.'s overstuffed schedule means that we many not get any more Louie for a while; though the series will eventually return for another season, C.K. has announced an indefinite hiatus while he focuses on other projects. 54. Daredevil (Netflix, April 10) Marvel extends its superheroic empire with the first of four Netflix-exclusive dramas. Charlie Cox stars as Daredevil, a blind superhero who fights crime using his enhanced other senses. (The remaining three shows — centered on Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage — will premiere later, with a miniseries combining all four characters to follow.) Daredevil has a fiercely loyal following among comics fans, but the first major adaptation of his story, which starred Ben Affleck, failed to connect with audiences in 2003. Since then, Marvel has essentially rewritten the book on superhero adaptations, and it's hard to imagine it will botch the opportunity to reintroduce a character with so much potential to mainstream audiences. UPDATE: Daredevil thrilled comic fans with a darker, tighter story than Marvel has ever told on the big screen. The second season, slated to premiere sometime in 2016, will up the ante by introducing The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal as fan-favorite antihero The Punisher. 55. Game of Thrones (HBO, April 12) Over four seasons, HBO's fantasy drama has achieved the kind of buzz most networks can only dream about, turning once-obscure phrases like \"Winter is Coming\" and \"Red Wedding\" into entrenched cultural catchphrases. Though many of the best moments from George R.R. Martin's novels have already occurred in the TV series, the fifth season of Game of Thrones is likely to be the most sprawling, with fan-favorite characters like Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark scattered across the world. TV shows rarely come more ambitious, or more compulsively watchable, than this. UPDATE: In its fifth season, Game of Thrones showed no signs of slowing down, ending on a brutal cliffhanger that has fans poring over set reports to try to guess its resolution. A sixth season will premiere in 2016. 56. Veep (HBO, April 12) Building on a third season that was easily the show's best, HBO's scathing political satire returns as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Selina Meyer — thrust into the nation's highest office after the unexpected resignation of the president — battles to keep her role in a contentious election. Veep is the ideal political satire for our time: hilarious, profane, and unfailingly committed to the idea that politicians on both sides of the aisle are petty, self-absorbed idiots. UPDATE: Veep's fourth season upped the stakes for every existing character while introducing some terrific new ones (played by actors like Patton Oswalt and Hugh Laurie). Veep will return for a fifth season, though creator Armando Ianucci has left the series. 57. Orphan Black (BBC America, April 18) The second season of Orphan Black was a step down from the addictive, propulsive first, but no matter how much it went off the rails, the sci-fi head-scratcher would be worth watching solely on the basis of its star. Over the course of the series, Tatiana Maslany has successfully played more than a dozen separate characters (all clones), and the third season adds a new adversary in a set of male clones (Ari Millen). UPDATE: Orphan Black is still pretty convoluted, but Maslany — finally nominated for a Best Actress Emmy — continues to anchor the series. A fourth season will premiere in 2016. 58. Happyish (Showtime, April 26) The genesis of Happyish is a sad story: the dramedy originally starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had already filmed the pilot before his sudden death. Those who have seen the originally Happyish pilot have testified to Hoffman's brilliance in the lead role, and while it's a shame that viewers will never get to see him in a recurring TV role, the new version of Happyish — which replaces Hoffman with Steve Coogan — still has plenty of promise. Happyish follows Thom Payne, a middle-aged ad executive who pushes back against a youth-driven culture as he staves off his own sense of irrelevance. UPDATE: Unfortunately, Happyish turned out to be a dud, held back by a smug and inconsistent tone despite the strong performances of its lead actors. Showtime cancelled the series after single season. 59. Penny Dreadful (Showtime, May 3) Forget Homeland and The Affair — the best series on Showtime is Penny Dreadful. This wonderfully morbid period horror-drama packs in all the best elements of gothic fiction: ornate dialogue, gorgeous locales, a lavish orchestral score, and a never-ending stream of creepy, otherworldly creatures to tempt our heroes into succumbing to their darker sides. Anchored by an unmissable performance from Eva Green and an impressive comeback role for Josh Hartnett, Penny Dreadful is TV's most compelling horror show. UPDATE: True to form, Penny Dreadful returned in all its bloody, gonzo glory, with a terrifying villain to match (Helen McRory). The series will return for a third season, though no premiere date has been set. 60. Wayward Pines (Fox, May 14) M. Night Shyamalan's offbeat thriller series is so clearly inspired by Twin Peaks that it almost borders on plagiarism — but if you're going to crib, you might as well crib from the best. Matt Dillon stars as a Secret Service agent sent to investigate the disappearance of two fellow agents in a small Idaho town, only to discover that the entire town is a bizarre slice of Americana filled with strange secrets. Based on Shyamalan's recent pedigree and the ludicrous teaser video, Wayward Pines could easily turn out to be a fiasco — but it definitely doesn't look boring. UPDATE: Wayward Pines turned out to be bonkers — but if bonkers was what you were looking for, it certainly delivered. No further installments have been announced, 61. Hannibal (NBC, June 4) Bryan Fuller's arty, gory take on the fictional killer is one of network TV's most unjustly overlooked dramas: gorgeous, strange, and embedded with a tense psychological depth. As Hannibal, Mads Mikkelsen is good enough to make you forget about Anthony Hopkins, and Hugh Dancy is every bit his equal as Will Graham, the troubled FBI profiler whose pursuit of Hannibal brought him to the brink of insanity. UPDATE: Despite a third season that brought Hannibal to new and terrifying heights, NBC has pulled the plug on the series. If you're behind, catch up and enjoy it while we still have it. 62. Sense8 (Netflix, June 5) The Wachowskis have never equaled the towering, genre-expanding success of The Matrix, but no one can deny the ambition of their follow-up projects. Sense8, their first TV series (in a partnership with Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski), follows eight strangers from across the world who suddenly, inexplicably become mentally and emotionally linked. UPDATE: Sense8 was extremely uneven, but it's hard to be overly frustrated by any series that works this hard to break from TV norms. A second season has been ordered, though no premiere date has been set. 63. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (Netflix, July 31) The cultishly adored comedic film — which follows a group of counselors through a surreal series of misadventures at a summer camp — is finally getting its long-discussed prequel in the form of a Netflix limited series. Impressively, the series has managed to assemble pretty much everybody from the movie's insanely stacked cast, including Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Paul Rudd, and Elizabeth Banks. UPDATE: Wet Hot American Summer was an absolute blast — a silly, uber-watchable series that perfectly matched the tone of the movie while introducing a series of new revelations that make it even more fun to watch. No word on another season, and the schedules of the cast might make one impossible — but fans should be thrilled they got this one. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.",

This pregnant mare has decided that playing with her own species isn’t quite as exciting as spending time with another animal. On the farm, the horses and the beloved family dogs love to play together in the pasture and even get into a rousing game of tag. “Here is my pregnant mare Velvet and 2-year-old April playing with my collie, Angel, and Great Pyrenees, Lady, out in the pasture just having fun,” their owner wrote on YouTube. In the video, the two horses and two pups waste no time playing together and really seem to be enjoying the beautiful weather. There are plenty of amazing interspecies friendships, like this dog and orangutan who make for an unlikely duo, but there’s nothing sweeter than watching these horses and dogs play. Judging from the video below, their owner did a fabulous job at raising these animals. They just get along so well together. And for those wondering, this pregnant mare has since given birth to a healthy little foal! Aww! If you love dogs and horses, you will love these guys as much or more.

    "DiffbotBody": "What Does Blowing Glass Smell Like? Diffusion Stations As Art in New Exhibition The multi-sensory, rainbow-infused exhibit at Heller Gallery is Katharine Gray’s first solo show in the Chelsea space. The art of glass blowing is alive and well in a most curious, colorful and scented sort of way—and in New York. This Makes Me Think of That is a multi-sensory, rainbow-infused exhibit at Heller Gallery, Katharine Gray’s first solo show in the Chelsea space. The artist said she designed the exhibition “to create some kind of simulated experience for those who will never enter a ‘hot shop’ or step foot on a glassblowing pad.” First, there’s perfume. The Los Angeles based glass artist, in a stroke of pure poetic genius, has collaborated with Opus Oils perfumer Kedra Hart to create four scents that capture the fragrances wafting about a glass studio. Visitors are invited to place their faces over four tall elegant funnel-like flacons, which are essentially diffusing stations, and take a whiff. “As soon as you walk in the hot shop {glass studio}, you get a blast of heat scented with beeswax,” said perfumer Ms. Hart who hung out in a hot box for a few hours for inspiration. She made “Wax,” the most conventionally pleasant scent, with honeyed, smoky materials including beeswax absolute and the very pricey choya nakh, distilled from crushed dry roasted seashells which gave a smoldering sensation. “Paper,” another scent, mimics the odor of the damp newspaper that’s used wet and folded as a shaping tool. “You can’t ever touch the hot glass with your hands directly, it’s too hot,” she said. “I loved that you could faintly smell the ink,” said Ms. Hart who based the wet newspaper scent around oak moss, with a little bit of oud, which she said has the beautiful decay of dampness. A new form of kava kava added the kick of the ink. A third perfume, “Block” replicates the charred cherry wood shaping tool the glass artist dips in water to put a cooling “skin” on glass while working. Seaweed absolute is one of the surprising ingredients, along with vetivert, patchouli and carrot seed. Finally, there is the musty, funky scent of the warm glove used to protect the glass blower from the intense heat when they are actually heating the glass in the furnace or glory hole. It is called “Sleeve,” named after the protective Kevlar sleeve worn by glassblowers, and as expected, had a peculiar olfactory charm lost on most visitors who sniffed it at the gallery. “It was basically a sweaty glove,” said Ms. Hart, who said she went through all the sweat molecules in her database seeking ingredients. “I have smelled fresh sweat that smells good but this glove had been used for a long time. It was the most challenging of all.” Was Ms. Gray at all concerned with putting people off? “No, not really,” she mused. “I found that when I would visit Kedra to smell what she was working on, even with the most off-putting smells, I would want to keep smelling. There was something still vaguely attractive in each one.” For A Rainbow Like You, the title of the visual stunner of the show, Ms. Gray used bright theatrical spotlights to heighten and project the colorful effects of the glasses she made, elevating the prosaic to the celestial. Ms. Gray said she was inspired by stained-glass windows but she was going for a more utilitarian sort of rapture. Ms. Gray had never seen any famed Murano glass from Venice when she blew her “first glass blob” in art school in Toronto when she was 19, but watching that glass magically transform through heat and breath was all it took for her to be hooked on glassblowing— heat, sweat and all. In the show she also shares the auditory experience—put your ear up to a hand-blown drinking glass and hear a recording of glass blowing. But despite the table of glorious, colorful hand-blown glassware dazzling in the reflective light it’s the quirky perfumes that secretly steal the show. If you’re bored with your Chanel No 5, Flower Bomb or L’Eau d’Issey, you can always take the olfactory experience of the hot box home with you, and though it’s a lot pricier than anything you’ll find at Sephora, it’s much more unique. Price, by the way, was no object in creating these perfumes. The gallery is selling limited-edition sets of the artistic scents—tiny vials in a gold leaf box —for $900 but Ms. Gray said they are more to “consult,” to remember the hot shop experience than to wear. Ms. Hart, however, does create seductive, heady, whimsical scents with enchanting names such as Pan, Absinthia and Babylon Noir. The show runs through July 31st. Katherine Gray",
    "LabBody": "If for nothing else, Omar Sharif should be commemorated and celebrated for his role in Doctor Zhivago. Alongside Julie Christie, his portrayal of the dashing hero became the 1960s’ most prolific movie-screen lover proto-type. In fact, it is hard to think of a rival since, who has equally and adequately portrayed a role filled with so much romance, drama and tenderness. Mr. Sharif played other heroes, too. As the charismatic and inspirational leader Sherif Ali, he played the foil to Peter O’Toole’s Lawrence of Arabia. Mr. Sharif’s Fidel Castro slipped under the radar great performances radar but marked a moment in time. It is as a romantic lead that Mr. Sharif will be so heartbrokenly remembered though. In Europe, this was tempered by a great sense of humor. During the 1970s the actor frequently played the fall guy to classic British comedians Morecambe and Wise on their weekly TV show. He was a private man with a big heart and a huge movie presence. We salute him here.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Tweet © Reprints Email Thirteen years ago, following a string of scandals that included Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers to reward big donors, Congress banned lawmakers from raising the unlimited campaign checks known as soft money. Now, soft money is back with a vengeance, just in a different guise. Back then, elected officials scooped up hundreds of millions directly from corporate and labor titans for their parties, often in exchange for special access and legislative favors. Then- Sen. Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who co-authored the soft-money ban with Arizona Republican John McCain, called it “legalized bribery.” Today, lawmakers are once again raising six-figure checks for the political parties — this time for special new accounts that pay for conventions, recounts and buildings. In just the first three months of the year, close to $13 million flowed into this new funding stream — mostly for the GOP. Checks as big as $600,000 and $700,000 are coming in from the likes of hedge fund manager Paul E. Singer, investment banker Warren A. Stephens and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Even bigger donations are fattening super PACs that ostensibly must keep candidates at arm’s length, but which increasingly operate as an appendage of politicians’ campaigns. The upshot is a fundraising bonanza reminiscent of the soft-money era, and even of Watergate. It’s too early to say what rewards big donors will enjoy in exchange for the unrestricted money they’re lavishing on parties and super PACs. But to the authors of the soft-money ban best known as the McCain-Feingold law, the return of high-dollar fundraising by members of Congress spells trouble. “I predict there will be a major scandal because there is too much money washing around,” McCain said at a Harvard University forum last year. The new party rules allow a single donor who gives the maximum to every one of a given party’s special accounts to max out at a whopping $801,600 a year — or $1.6 million per election cycle. That’s a far cry from the individual contribution limits of $2,700 per election to a candidate and $33,400 annually to a party committee — caps that technically still stand but that look increasingly quaint. The Supreme Court has relaxed limits all around. In 2010, the court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling overturned all limits on independent political spending. And last year, in McCutcheon v. FEC, the court struck aggregate limits on how much one donor could give to parties and candidates collectively in an election cycle. The legal firewall between super PACs and the candidates they back is breaking down. By law, candidates may ask super PAC donors for $5,000 in so-called hard, or regulated, money. So White House hopefuls, including five sitting senators, are asking billionaire donors for $5,000 — but the super PACs that back the candidates are pocketing checks in the millions with a wink and a nod. comments powered by Disqus Tweet © Reprints Email “The campaign finance laws prohibit federal office holders from soliciting or raising unlimited contributions,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the watchdog group Democracy 21, which has asked the Justice Department to investigate. “And that is precisely what the federal office holders who are running for president now feel free to do.” Back to the Future First Amendment champions blame McCain-Feingold for weakening the political parties, and applaud Citizens United for enhancing competition. Party leaders, too, have chafed at the soft-money ban. That helps explain why, in a rare show of bipartisanship, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada and GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tucked a measure that blew the lid off party fundraising limits into last year’s omnibus spending deal. But Democrats have collected barely $800,000 for their new special party accounts, while Republicans pulled in a cool $12 million for them in the first six months of this year. “It’s long been true that Democrats raise more money from low-dollar donors and the grass roots, and the GOP relies on wealthy millionaires and billionaires like the Kochs,” said Justin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “I’ve seen nothing that shows that’s going to change any time soon.” Party officials won’t say how they are filling these new coffers. But public records show that Republicans, at least, are relying in part on GOP leaders to solicit the money. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and his top two lieutenants — Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana — have collectively raised $7.3 million in the first quarter of this year for their respective joint fundraising committees from CEOs, lobbyists and financiers. Some of the money going into those joint committees, which divvy up their receipts between multiple accounts, has gone to the new political party funds. “We don’t know enough yet about how the parties are raising money for these new accounts,” said Trevor Potter, a former Federal Election Commission chairman and general counsel to the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “But people don’t just sit down and say: ‘Gosh, I think I’ve got to write a check to the convention account today.’ So who is asking for what? What is being promised? What are people gaining for giving this?” Super Solicitations Super PAC solicitations raise even bigger questions, said Potter, whose institute is also asking the Justice Department to investigate. Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican and White House hopeful, ostensibly did not ask his pal Norman Braman, the billionaire car dealer, for more than $5,000. But Braman is expected to give as much as $10 million to the super PAC backing Rubio, known as Conservative Solutions. Likewise Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, another White House aspirant, has made no bones about meeting with donors eager to underwrite a network of four super PACs backing him with variations on the name Keep the Promise. The PACs are said to have received as much as $31 million from hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer, already a Cruz campaign donor. All told they’ve pulled in $37 million. “We feel very confident that we are operating within the law and what we are allowed to do,” said Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier. comments powered by Disqus Tweet © Reprints Email If unfettered campaign spending has rendered contribution limits all but meaningless, conservatives say the solution is to simply eliminate them. “Our view is that they should take the contribution limits off altogether, and the candidates should be able to ask for money for their own campaigns,” said David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics. “That’s publicly reported, they’re responsible for the messaging in the campaign and also being identified with the donors directly.” Advocates of campaign restrictions have countered with a long list of bills that have gone nowhere on Capitol Hill. Feingold, who lost his 2010 re-election bid to Republican Ron Johnson but is seeking a rematch, all but admits the law he co-authored with McCain is no longer working. “People tell me all the time that our politics in Washington are broken and that multimillionaires and big corporations are calling all the shots,” Feingold said in May as he announced his candidacy. “They say this especially about the U.S. Senate, and it’s hard not to agree.” comments powered by Disqus",

The molding I added and it gives the room more character. Biggest Challenge: Working with the living room's triangle shape, making it a square. What Friends Say: They always comment how cozy it feels and on the eggplant color. Biggest Embarrassment: The chandelier in the living room is a vintage piece from Sweden so the fit is not flush to the ceiling.. you can see the small hole around the chandelier top. Proudest DIY: Bookcases! I purchased from West Elm on sale and re-painted them. Also knocked out some of the back which was extremely hard because the backs were made from pressed wood. So as you can imagine the wood just crumbled in small pieces. Biggest Indulgence: Wallpaper! Ordered from Domino home. It is hand painted and by far my biggest indulgence. It gives the room some texture and dimension. Best Advice: Put dimmers on lights! It sets the mood and makes a space cozy.

Doug Engle/Ocala Star-Banner Published: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 7:31 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, July 10, 2015 at 7:31 p.m. A group of 11- and 12-year-olds from Jacksonville were in Ocala this week spending part of their summer vacation helping others. The children were with Highlands Presbyterian Church and were at the Ocala Wildlife Sanctuary, or OWLS, on Friday afternoon. OWLS is a nonprofit rehabilitation and education center that houses more than 100 animals. The animals at the sanctuary include owls, but there are also ducks, chickens, parrots and even a deer named Buttercup. \"These children are performing a selfless act. Most people during summer are on vacation. Hopefully, it will be an inspiration for others,\" said Kenny Lane, vice president of the organization. During their time at the sanctuary, the group helped weed a garden and cleaned fountains used by the birds. About an hour into the visit, the skies opened up thanks to the familiar afternoon storms. The rain, however, did little to dampen the children's enthusiasm. \"I loved the rain. I like to play in the rain when it's not lightning out,\" said Nicole Kleppen, who will enter the seventh grade in the fall. The brief soaking did help take the bite out of the day's high temperatures. \"It's not 120 degrees anymore, so it could be worse,\" said Heather Mauney, one of the group's chaperones. Keith Belisle, OWLS' founder, was taken with the children's attitudes. \"Their personalities are wonderful. Even though it was raining, they were out there laughing and having a good time,\" Belisle said. The sanctuary was the group's last stop and they planned to head back to Jacksonville on Saturday. They arrived on Wednesday and started work on Thursday. They volunteered at Brother's Keeper soup kitchen, a nursing home and at Ocala Equine Rescue. \"The kids have really been excited to give back and serve. They have been learning about different things and how their actions impact more than their little bubble,\" Mauney said. The trip didn't come without a small tragedy or two. Tianna Kleppen's glasses were stepped on and broken. \"It was raining. I wanted to go clean them and they dropped. Then Tiffany, not on purpose, stepped on them and they broke,\" Tianna said. For OWLS, the help came at the perfect time. They are stretched thinly since another area sanctuary closed recently. \"It was a blessing at a time when we needed that extra help,\" Belisle said. Lane agreed. \"They don't realize how much of a difference they are making,\" he said. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition. All rights reserved.

July 10, 2015 7:31 PM. \u003cp\u003eA group of 11- and 12-year-olds from Jacksonville were in Ocala this week spending part of their summer vacation helping others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe children were with Highlands Presbyterian Church and were at the Ocala Wildlife Sanctuary, or OWLS, on Friday afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOWLS is a nonprofit rehabilitation and education center that houses more than 100 animals. The animals at the sanctuary include owls, but there are also ducks, chickens, parrots and even a deer named Buttercup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"These children are performing a selfless act. Most people during summer are on vacation. Hopefully, it will be an inspiration for others,\" said Kenny Lane, vice president of the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring their time at the sanctuary, the group helped weed a garden and cleaned fountains used by the birds. About an hour into the visit, the skies opened up thanks to the familiar afternoon storms. The rain, however, did little to dampen the children's enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I loved the rain. I like to play in the rain when it's not lightning out,\" said Nicole Kleppen, who will enter the seventh grade in the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe brief soaking did help take the bite out of the day's high temperatures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"It's not 120 degrees anymore, so it could be worse,\" said Heather Mauney, one of the group's chaperones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeith Belisle, OWLS' founder, was taken with the children's attitudes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Their personalities are wonderful. Even though it was raining, they were out there laughing and having a good time,\" Belisle said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sanctuary was the group's last stop and they planned to head back to Jacksonville on Saturday. They arrived on Wednesday and started work on Thursday. They volunteered at Brother's Keeper soup kitchen, a nursing home and at Ocala Equine Rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"The kids have really been excited to give back and serve.

    "DiffbotBody": "In his first book, author Jason Smith explores the depravity and desperation required to maintain an opiate addiction so fierce, he finds himself jumping continents to avoid jail time and learns the hard way that some demons cannot be outrun. While teaching in Europe, he meets a prostitute who secures drugs for him at the dangerous price of helping out the Russian mafia; in China, he gets his Percocet and Xanax fix but terrifies a crowd of children and parents at his job in the process; and in Mexico, Smith thought a Tijuana jail cell would be the perfect place to kick his Fentanyl habit, but soon realizes that the power of addiction is stronger than his desire to escape it. The Bitter Taste of Dying paints a portrait of the modern day drug addict with clarity and refreshing honesty. With a gritty mixture of self-deprecation and light-hearted confessional, Smith’s memoir deftly describes the journey into the harrowing depths of addiction and demonstrates the experience of finally being released from it.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Pottstown, PA Pottstown residents may soon be calling the Chestnut Street Park the Newstell Marable Park. Newstell Marable Sr., longtime president of the Pottstown Chapter of the NAACP, died at the age of 84 in January, two days after Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Over the past few months borough council has discussed naming something in his honor. It will make a decision in August about naming the half-acre park at Chestnut and North Washington streets after conferring with Marable's widow, Millicent. Councilwoman Sheryl A. Miller suggested the park at Monday's meeting, at which Mayor Sharon Valentine-Thomas also read a proclamation honoring Marable's work advocating fair labor and housing, among other social justice causes. Marable's sister, Margaret Seltmann, and other family members attended the meeting to receive the written recognition. \"Until his passing, he was still trying to say we must find something in this community to provide jobs for our adults and keep them in this town,\" Seltmann said. Councilman Joseph L. Kirkland said Marable was a mentor to him. \"I always appreciated his input and followed his advice,\" Kirkland said, adding that the biggest lesson he learned was to always listen to opposing viewpoints. Bishop Everett V. Debnam, senior pastor at Invictus Church on Hanover Street, said Marable was one of the first people he met when he moved to Pottstown 28 years ago. \"He had the same goals I had,\" Debnam said. Debnam, Marable and about 300 others visited the Pottsgrove and Boyertown school districts at various times as advocates for integration and equality. Debnam said the 1990s were a particularly difficult time in Boyertown because the Ku Klux Klan was still active in the area. But, he said, Marable was never intimidated. \"He stood for people of color,\" Debnam said. \"And don't get offended. White is a color, too. He stood for people. He stood for humanity.\" Contact Paige Cooperstein: 610-371-5021 or pcooperstein@readingeagle.com.",

    "LabBody": "Dog Abandoned at Train Station with His Suitcase. Tuesday, a picture of dog in Scotland went viral. He had been tied to a railing at Ayr station, and was found with a small suitcase containing his belongings: a food dish, a pillow, a dog toy, and some dog food. The dog, a mixed breed resembling a shar-pei, was taken to the SSPCA. Officials there found a microchip, but the last record said the dog named Kai had been sold on the internet site Gumtree in 2013, but not to whom. Today, the Daily Record identified the woman who left the dog at the station as Fin Rayner. Rayner said she met a man to buy a dog through Gumtree, but the dog was not as advertised and the man fled with a £150 deposit, leaving her with Kai. Rayner does not believe she did anything wrong by leaving the dog at the station. Meanwhile, the SSPCA has received many calls from people who want Kai. Turn Signal Removed from Arm 51 Years After Wreck. Arthur Lampitt of Granite City, Illinois, wrecked his new Thunderbird. He suffered multiple injuries, the worst of which was a shattered hip. That was in 1963. A few years ago, Lampitt set off a metal detector that indicated there was metal embedded in his arm, although it didn’t bother him. Recently, the arm began to bulge and hurt, so he decided to have the metal removed. He thought that it might have been a surgical instrument left from 1963. When the operation was done, doctors removed a 7-inch piece of metal that was identified as a Thunderbird turn signal handle! Doctors were surprised that the arm never became infected. They say Lampitt’s body grew a protective pouch around the metal all those years ago. Surgery for Constipated Goldfish. A devoted pet owner in North Walsham, Norfolk, UK, took his goldfish to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre because the fish was constipated. The only way to save the fish was with surgery, which cost £300 ($454). After a few minutes consideration, the owner opted for the surgery. Veterinarian Faye Bethell performed the procedure, which involved removing lumps from two places in the fish. Each cut was covered with three stitches and sealed with waterproof glue. Bethell said, \"The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anesthetic is quite complicated. \"The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died. \"There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.\" Mrs. Doubtfire House a Victim of Arson. The house in San Francisco where the film Mrs. Doubtfire was filmed was converted into a makeshift shrine when star Robin Williams died in August. Then on Monday evening, two fires were set on the porch. The current homeowner, Dr. Douglas K. Ousterhout, is a renowned craniofacial surgeon. Ousterhout put out the fires himself and called police. On Wednesday, police arrested one of Ousterhout’s former patients, 25-year-old Tyqwon Eugenen Welch. The arrest should extinguish rumors of a large elderly woman starting a fire while trying to cook. Boa Constrictor Emerges From Toilet. Stephanie Lacsa runs a business in downtown San Diego. When a toilet appeared to be stopped up, she took a plunger to it. She was astonished to find that the stoppage was caused by a 5-foot boa constrictor. When she removed the plunger, the snake came slithering out, flicking its tongue at her! Lacsa and her business partner climbed atop their desks to avoid the snake. Animal control responded and identified the snake as a Colombian rainbow boa constrictor. According to the news video, the building’s landlord found out that the snake belonged to another tenant. Minivan Dragged 16 Miles by Truck. Matt and Pamela Menz were traveling in their minivan with their two children during the snowstorm Wednesday morning on I-75 in Michigan when they slid into a tractor-trailer. The minivan became wedged under the back end of the truck, which the truck driver did not notice. The minivan lost power, so Menz could not blow the horn, flash the lights, or even see where they were going. Pamela Menz called 911 and told the Roscommon County dispatcher what had happened, but they could not see the mile markers to give a location. The truck driver eventually left the interstate, and Matt Menz was able to identify the exit. Police pulled the truck driver over, still unaware that he’d been towing the minivan. They had covered 16 miles over the 25-minute ride. The Menz family was uninjured, but were taken to a local hospital to be checked out. You can hear portions of the 911 call in a video at WOOD.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Africa's elephants are at risk of going extinct in large part because of poaching for the ivory, and advocates are hopeful that the U.S. government can stop the crisis with new rules at home. But there's a diverse and fierce lobbying coalition against the proposed rules barring the trade of ivory, and a House vote this week shows that it's going to be an uphill battle to protect them. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected this summer to propose rules banning the commercial trade of elephant ivory in the U.S. unless a product is shown to be in compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The rules wouldn't directly affect elephant poaching in Africa, but supporters say they will help turn the market against illegal ivory and put a dent in poaching, which has doubled since 2007. The U.S. is the second-largest market for illegal wildlife products, trailing only China. As many as 35,000 elephants were killed by poachers in 2012, according to the Interior Department, and their numbers are now below a half million in Africa. The Obama administration has made a crackdown on illegal wildlife trade a priority, highlighted by a spectacular crushing of a ton of illegal ivory in Times Square last month. \"The U.S. is a stunningly large black market for illegal wildlife products and most Americans don't realize it,\" said Don Barry, senior vice president of conservation programs for Defenders of Wildlife. \"A huge amount of illegal ivory is pouring in here that's smuggled, and then it's very difficult to keep it away from the ivory that's here legally. And trying to regulate it is like wrapping your lips around a fire hose.\" But the rule has found an unusual set of opponents. There's not a collaborative effort, but several parties are raising their own concerns. Hunting groups have said the rule is an overreach, while antiques dealers claim it would hurt their dealings. The National Rifle Association has said it would trample gun owners' rights to have guns with ivory handles. Even musicians, including the League of American Orchestras, have raised concerns with the rules, saying they would make it impossible to move pianos with ivory keys across international borders (FWS says there will be flexibilities in the proposed rule to address those concerns and last year built in allowances for musical instruments and museum specimens). Although the LAO has raised concerns about international travel, in a statement the group said it did not have a position on the broader Interior bill and was awaiting the rules on interstate commerce before taking a policy stance. Republicans, thus, have vowed to fight the rules, saying there are less-intrusive ways to protect the endangered elephant population. Their first strike came Tuesday over the debate on the Interior Department's fiscal 2016 appropriations bill, which contained a rider that would scrap the rules. Democrats, led by Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, offered up an amendment to remove the rider, which was seen as a trial balloon to gauge congressional support for protecting the FWS rules. In a sign of its importance, the NRA even scored the vote, putting pressure on the Republican base to stick together. Explaining its decision, the NRA said the regulations would be \"disastrous\" for sportsmen and gun owners, making \"American owners of legal ivory potential criminals overnight.\" The end result? It failed 183-244 largely along party lines. (The underlying spending bill was pulled Thursday due to controversy over the Confederate flag.) But it won't be the last attempt to attack the ivory rules, and it's possible that future vehicles will be tougher for Democrats to turn down. Chip Burkhalter, director of government relations for Safari Club International, said he was encouraged to see the Republican majority block the rules, saying it was an \"effective\" message. Similar language ditching the rules is included in a package from Republican Rep. Robert Wittman of Virginia that wraps up several measures to open up land for hunters and sportsmen. Traditionally the sportsmen's packages have attracted bipartisan support, and Wittman's bill has three Democratic cosponsors. A similar package in the Senate from Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski and New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich does not include the ivory language, although in previous sessions, lawmakers included it as an amendment. Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said he's planning to introduce legislation soon that would address the interstate regulations, adding that a sportsmen's package could be a possible vehicle. To be sure, nobody's trying to reopen illegal ivory trading and put elephants back at risk. The opponents just see the FWS rules as too heavy-handed and harmful for Americans. \"We want to promote conservation and protection in Africa, but ensure we protect the rights of those who have antique musical instruments and antique firearms,\" Daines said, adding that he'd like to see closer work with legal hunting groups. \"Hunters are the best conservationists, because they believe in the conservation of the species.\" Conservation groups, however, say the regulations are a necessary step that shifts the burden of proof away from the overtaxed Fish and Wildlife Service and onto owners and dealers. Beyond addressing the import and export of ivory, the FWS has also clarified the definition of \"antique,\" requiring an owner to certify that an item is more than 100 years old to qualify. Before the amendment vote, Grijalva had said he'd feel good if he was able to get just 140 members to vote for it, a target he cleared. Still, he said, there's been \"intense\" lobbying that has targeted Democrats, and nine members did cross over to vote in favor of the rider. Six Republicans, including Rep. Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, voted for Grijalva's amendment and in favor of the federal rules. \"Overall, getting a rule that works towards a ban while still allowing those legitimate functions to occur is a good idea,\" Grijalva said. He said the hope was that Democrats could hold off further attacks until the rule is published, which would allow opponents to see what sort of exemptions the government would allow. Barry said the rider was like \"trying to kill a mosquito with a shotgun\" because it was using slivers of opposition to try to defeat the entire effort. It is important, he added, to act quickly and convince members that the rule won't be as painful as critics say, before a stronger effort came forth. \"I've seen few issues that had a compelling reason for tougher regulatory control and restriction than to protect elephants,\" Barry said. \"Elephants are the symbol of the Republican Party and they're dying. If this isn't a crisis, I don't know what is.\" CORRECTION: The original version of this article said there were concerns about the rules affect transport of instruments across state lines rather than international borders. This article has also been updated to clarify the position of the League of American Orchestras.",
    "LabBody": "July 9, 2015 Africa’s ele­phants are at risk of go­ing ex­tinct in large part be­cause of poach­ing for the ivory, and ad­voc­ates are hope­ful that the U.S. gov­ern­ment can stop the crisis with new rules at home. But there’s a di­verse and fierce lob­by­ing co­ali­tion against the pro­posed rules bar­ring the trade of ivory, and a House vote this week shows that it’s go­ing to be an up­hill battle to pro­tect them. The U.S. Fish and Wild­life Ser­vice is ex­pec­ted this sum­mer to pro­pose rules ban­ning the com­mer­cial trade of ele­phant ivory in the U.S. un­less a product is shown to be in com­pli­ance with the En­dangered Spe­cies Act. The rules wouldn’t dir­ectly af­fect ele­phant poach­ing in Africa, but sup­port­ers say they will help turn the mar­ket against il­leg­al ivory and put a dent in poach­ing, which has doubled since 2007. The U.S. is the second-largest mar­ket for il­leg­al wild­life products, trail­ing only China. As many as 35,000 ele­phants were killed by poach­ers in 2012, ac­cord­ing to the In­teri­or De­part­ment, and their num­bers are now be­low a half mil­lion in Africa. The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion has made a crack­down on il­leg­al wild­life trade a pri­or­ity, high­lighted by a spec­tac­u­lar crush­ing of a ton of il­leg­al ivory in Times Square last month. “The U.S. is a stun­ningly large black mar­ket for il­leg­al wild­life products and most Amer­ic­ans don’t real­ize it,” said Don Barry, seni­or vice pres­id­ent of con­ser­va­tion pro­grams for De­fend­ers of Wild­life. “A huge amount of il­leg­al ivory is pour­ing in here that’s smuggled, and then it’s very dif­fi­cult to keep it away from the ivory that’s here leg­ally. And try­ing to reg­u­late it is like wrap­ping your lips around a fire hose.” But the rule has found an un­usu­al set of op­pon­ents. There’s not a col­lab­or­at­ive ef­fort, but sev­er­al parties are rais­ing their own con­cerns. Hunt­ing groups have said the rule is an over­reach, while an­tiques deal­ers claim it would hurt their deal­ings. The Na­tion­al Rifle As­so­ci­ation has said it would trample gun own­ers’ rights to have guns with ivory handles. Even mu­si­cians, in­clud­ing the League of Amer­ic­an Or­ches­tras, have raised con­cerns with the rules, say­ing they would make it im­possible to move pi­anos with ivory keys across in­ter­na­tion­al bor­ders (FWS says there will be flex­ib­il­it­ies in the pro­posed rule to ad­dress those con­cerns and last year built in al­low­ances for mu­sic­al in­stru­ments and mu­seum spe­ci­mens). Al­though the LAO has raised con­cerns about in­ter­na­tion­al travel, in a state­ment the group said it did not have a po­s­i­tion on the broad­er In­teri­or bill and was await­ing the rules on in­ter­state com­merce be­fore tak­ing a policy stance. Re­pub­lic­ans, thus, have vowed to fight the rules, say­ing there are less-in­trus­ive ways to pro­tect the en­dangered ele­phant pop­u­la­tion. Their first strike came Tues­day over the de­bate on the In­teri­or De­part­ment’s fisc­al 2016 ap­pro­pri­ations bill, which con­tained a rider that would scrap the rules. Demo­crats, led by Rep. Raul Gri­jalva of Ari­zona, offered up an amend­ment to re­move the rider, which was seen as a tri­al bal­loon to gauge con­gres­sion­al sup­port for pro­tect­ing the FWS rules. In a sign of its im­port­ance, the NRA even scored the vote, put­ting pres­sure on the Re­pub­lic­an base to stick to­geth­er. Ex­plain­ing its de­cision, the NRA said the reg­u­la­tions would be “dis­astrous” for sports­men and gun own­ers, mak­ing “Amer­ic­an own­ers of leg­al ivory po­ten­tial crim­in­als overnight.” The end res­ult? It failed 183-244 largely along party lines. (The un­der­ly­ing spend­ing bill was pulled Thursday due to con­tro­versy over the Con­fed­er­ate flag.) But it won’t be the last at­tempt to at­tack the ivory rules, and it’s pos­sible that fu­ture vehicles will be tough­er for Demo­crats to turn down. Chip Burkhal­ter, dir­ect­or of gov­ern­ment re­la­tions for Sa­fari Club In­ter­na­tion­al, said he was en­cour­aged to see the Re­pub­lic­an ma­jor­ity block the rules, say­ing it was an “ef­fect­ive” mes­sage. Sim­il­ar lan­guage ditch­ing the rules is in­cluded in a pack­age from Re­pub­lic­an Rep. Robert Wittman of Vir­gin­ia that wraps up sev­er­al meas­ures to open up land for hunters and sports­men. Tra­di­tion­ally the sports­men’s pack­ages have at­trac­ted bi­par­tis­an sup­port, and Wittman’s bill has three Demo­crat­ic co­spon­sors. A sim­il­ar pack­age in the Sen­ate from Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski and New Mex­ico Demo­crat­ic Sen. Mar­tin Hein­rich does not in­clude the ivory lan­guage, al­though in pre­vi­ous ses­sions, law­makers in­cluded it as an amend­ment. Montana Re­pub­lic­an Sen. Steve Daines said he’s plan­ning to in­tro­duce le­gis­la­tion soon that would ad­dress the in­ter­state reg­u­la­tions, adding that a sports­men’s pack­age could be a pos­sible vehicle. Most Read. 1 2 3 4 5 To be sure, nobody’s try­ing to re­open il­leg­al ivory trad­ing and put ele­phants back at risk. The op­pon­ents just see the FWS rules as too heavy-handed and harm­ful for Amer­ic­ans. “We want to pro­mote con­ser­va­tion and pro­tec­tion in Africa, but en­sure we pro­tect the rights of those who have an­tique mu­sic­al in­stru­ments and an­tique fire­arms,” Daines said, adding that he’d like to see closer work with leg­al hunt­ing groups. “Hunters are the best con­ser­va­tion­ists, be­cause they be­lieve in the con­ser­va­tion of the spe­cies.” Con­ser­va­tion groups, however, say the reg­u­la­tions are a ne­ces­sary step that shifts the bur­den of proof away from the over­taxed Fish and Wild­life Ser­vice and onto own­ers and deal­ers. Bey­ond ad­dress­ing the im­port and ex­port of ivory, the FWS has also cla­ri­fied the defin­i­tion of “an­tique,” re­quir­ing an own­er to cer­ti­fy that an item is more than 100 years old to qual­i­fy. Be­fore the amend­ment vote, Gri­jalva had said he’d feel good if he was able to get just 140 mem­bers to vote for it, a tar­get he cleared. Still, he said, there’s been “in­tense” lob­by­ing that has tar­geted Demo­crats, and nine mem­bers did cross over to vote in fa­vor of the rider. Six Re­pub­lic­ans, in­clud­ing Rep. Ed Whit­field of Ken­tucky, voted for Gri­jalva’s amend­ment and in fa­vor of the fed­er­al rules. “Over­all, get­ting a rule that works to­wards a ban while still al­low­ing those le­git­im­ate func­tions to oc­cur is a good idea,” Gri­jalva said. He said the hope was that Demo­crats could hold off fur­ther at­tacks un­til the rule is pub­lished, which would al­low op­pon­ents to see what sort of ex­emp­tions the gov­ern­ment would al­low. Barry said the rider was like “try­ing to kill a mos­quito with a shot­gun” be­cause it was us­ing sliv­ers of op­pos­i­tion to try to de­feat the en­tire ef­fort. It is im­port­ant, he ad­ded, to act quickly and con­vince mem­bers that the rule won’t be as pain­ful as crit­ics say, be­fore a stronger ef­fort came forth. “I’ve seen few is­sues that had a com­pel­ling reas­on for tough­er reg­u­lat­ory con­trol and re­stric­tion than to pro­tect ele­phants,” Barry said. “Ele­phants are the sym­bol of the Re­pub­lic­an Party and they’re dy­ing. If this isn’t a crisis, I don’t know what is.” COR­REC­TION: The ori­gin­al ver­sion of this art­icle said there were con­cerns about the rules af­fect trans­port of in­stru­ments across state lines rather than in­ter­na­tion­al bor­ders.

    "DiffbotBody": "HAVANA— European officials and businesses are visiting Cuba in unprecedented numbers, attracted by its market-oriented reforms and hastened to act by Havana's improved relations with the United States. Seventy-five companies accompanied Jose Manuel Soria, Spain's minister of industry, energy and tourism, during his visit this week, and 140 Italian firms also visited with Italy's deputy minister for economic development, Carlo Calenda. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was also scheduled to lead a delegation of 100 businesses to Cuba, but that trip was postponed because of ongoing talks with Iran and the crisis in Greece. Similar delegations from France, Britain and the Netherlands have arrived in recent weeks. \"No one wants to miss the train,\" said Herman Portocarero, the European Union's ambassador to Cuba. Since President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro announced last December they would restore diplomatic ties, scores of U.S. businesses have come calling, including conglomerates such as Johnson \u0026 Johnson, Dow Chemical , Microsoft, Google, Dell and U.S. airlines. They remain largely shut out by a U.S. economic embargo, which Obama is asking Congress to lift, so the Europeans are attempting to seize the moment while they still have an advantage. \"The crowning glory was when President Raul Castro visited Rome [in May]. He told us to hurry up and come with our companies, and we did so quickly,\" Mario Giro, Italy's undersecretary for foreign affairs, told reporters in Havana late Wednesday. Italian companies have 14 projects planned for Cuba's Chinese-style special development zone around the newly built container port at Mariel, he said. Spain is Cuba's third-largest economic partner after Venezuela and China, and its hospitality companies led by Sol Melia manage dozens of hotels on the island. \"For the government of Spain and the majority of Spanish companies, a new moment full of opportunity has begun,\" Soria, the Spanish industry, energy and tourism minister, said. The Mariel economic zone was especially attractive for investors, because it allows wholly owned foreign companies to repatriate profits under a favorable tax regime, he added.",

The exemption from property taxes would allow the company to save $1.2 million this fiscal year and $2.3 million in the next fiscal year, according to documents. Walmart will create at least 300 and up to 625 jobs with an average annual wage of $42,087, according to county documents. Construction costs and equipment for the new center is expected to generate $206.8 million in capital investment. Construction will begin in the third quarter of 2015, with Walmart to close to on the property in the second quarter of 2016. The facility is set to begin operating by the third or fourth quarter of 2016. It will be built adjacent to FedEx Ground Shipping Services new 300,000-square-foot distribution center, which is under construction. A Walmart spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday morning. The Tampa Bay Business Journal first reported in November 2014 that Walmart was looking for a site for an ecommerce distribution center in Polk County. In February, TBBJ learned that the company had zeroed in on two sites: the Davenport property and CSX Corp.'s Central Florida Intermodal Logistics Center in Winter Haven.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Republican 2016 presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush is catching flak for saying Americans need to “work longer hours” in order to improve the economy. But was his statement really so outlandish? Bush, the former governor of Florida, made the comment at a meeting with the editorial board of the New Hampshire Union Leader on Wednesday. MSNBC quickly went for Bush’s throat, asking if there was anything else Bush could say to “put him at odds with U.S. workers.” Quartz published a piece belaboring the fact that Americans already work very long hours when compared to the rest of the world, titled “Hey Jeb Bush: Americans already work longer hours than anyone in the developed world (except South Koreans).” And multiple outlets ran headlines that imply that Bush wants you to work yourself to death. Bush's statement, however, has been taken out of context. Here’s the full quote: \"My aspiration for the country, and I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see,\" Bush said. \"Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.\" In other words, Bush is actually pushing for more full-time workers and higher workforce participation, an idea often shared by those on the left. Responding to attacks from Democrats, Bush quickly clarified the quote to it’s actual meaning. \"If we’re going to grow the economy, people need to stop being part-time workers, they need to be having access to greater opportunities to work,” Bush later told reporters. Bush wasn’t suggesting that American who already have full-time jobs need to work longer than the typical 9-to-5 workday. Rather, he's saying more Americans need more than just part-time gigs. That didn’t stop the press from taking Bush’s out-of-context quote and running wild. Democratic rival Hillary Clinton also hopped on the train of taking Bush’s quote out of context. Bush quickly shot back, implying Clinton “hasn’t listened” to American workers. Bush is right, too. Some 18.6 percent of the U.S. workforce—more than 27.6 million Americans ages 16 and over—work fewer than 35 hours per week, the government's threshold for full-time employment, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's only a 1.5 percent drop from a high of 20.1 percent in January 2010 and higher than at any point between 2000 and 2009, the height of the Great Recession.

    "DiffbotBody": "Her sister recently just became a single mother-of-three since splitting from longtime boyfriend Scott Disick. And on Thursday, Kim Kardashian continued to rally around her older sibling Kourtney Kardashian by showing some sisterly support on her Instagram page with a throwback photo from 2008. The pregnant 34-year-old reality star has been there for her 36-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians co-star in the last few days following Scott's reportedly wild behavior of partying and flirting with rumoured ex Chloe Bartoli. Scroll down for video Kim shared an old photo of the siblings having fun in a photobooth complete with playful props and a red curtain backdrop. In the snap, Mrs Kanye West is pictured on the right wearing a purple satin dress showing off her toned arm with her hand on her hip. The mother-of-one donned a white glove on her right hand and covered her eyes with her husband's signature music video glasses even noting: '#KanyeStrongerGlasses.' Meanwhile Kourtney wore a strapless scarlet mini dress and was dressed in a costume of blue feather boa, rose coloured sunglasses and fake flowers. Kim's TBT photo comes days after Kourtney and Scott reportedly ended their near decade romance. The parents-of-three have been leading separate lives since their split, with the eldest Kardashian sister even moving her ex's belongings out of their shared Calabasas home. In the midst of his cheating scandal, Scott has postponed a previously scheduled nightclub appearance at his go-to spot 1OAK in Las Vegas. On the same day, it was claimed that the reality star went in and out of rehab in Florida. Us Weekly reported that the troubled star spent just a few hours in the centre, which is believed to be near where he is staying with rumoured ex-girlfriend Chloe. It's unclear if the reality star cancelled his club appearance in a bid to show his ex-girlfriend that he is trying to reform his bad boy ways, or if he wants to avoid being grilled about the split on the red carpet. Scott broke his silence to dedicate a birthday post to daughter Penelope on her birthday: '1 of the only things I'm proud off [sic] about myself. Happybdayp.' Kourtney celebrated the former couple's only daughter's third birthday on July 9 at the Disneyland Resort without Scott, as aunt Kim was in attendance to help commemorate the special day. Since the split, Kourtney has continued to post photos on her social media pages including a selfie from Disneyland writing: 'MVP goes to @kimkardashian for hanging with my crazy Disney obsessed self for 12 hours of major madness. #Disneyland.' On Wednesday, momager Kris Jenner gave an update on her newly single child saying: 'Kourtney's good. Kourtney's hanging in there. We're [all] kind of on lockdown right now. We're filming season 11 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.' Kourtney and Scott have three children together, Mason, five, Penelope, three, and six-month-old Reign.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The “Me” of the title is Greg, through whom the story is told. As played by Thomas Mann, Greg is a fascinating mix — witty and clever, with a subterranean self-esteem and an elaborate strategy for surviving high school in spite of it. His idea is to be mildly friendly to everyone and engage with no one, except Earl (RJ Cyler), with whom he makes a series of short films. He never refers to Earl as his friend but as his business partner. The friendship with Rachel is forced on him. His mother is friends with her mother, and when the word comes that Rachel is sick, his mother insists that he go to see her. Rachel doesn’t want to be visited, and Greg has nothing to say to her, but gradually they find they have things in common — an arch sense of humor, an appreciation of art, an outsider’s angle on things.

    "DiffbotBody": "Though Sleeper is a gentler record than any other in Ty Segall’s catalogue, the title track does have a specific precursor: 2011’s “Goodbye Bread”, another album opener, was an annunciation of sorts, a broadening of the range we’d come to expect from one of California’s leading garage rockers. It was the prettiest thing Segall had done up to that point, and the saddest. And with “Sleeper”, he makes good on that promise of depth, channeling pain and anger into one of his most poignant songs. Segall both writes and plays with a sincerity that never devolves into sentimentality, but his voice is strained, his guitar is heavy and loose, and there’s a subtle otherworldliness, an ethereal lilting feedback buried within that’s only revealed once the song’s reached its end. —Jonah Bromwich Con · trolled – verb Definition: The act of decimating rivals to inflict public humiliation. Characterized by exhibition of no mercy or sympathy for perceived weaknesses in an opponent. Etymology: The verb first came to usage on August 12, 2013, when G.O.O.D. Music stocking stuffer Big Sean dropped “Control” on Twitter. The seven-and-a-half minute song featured the ghost of Jay Electronica and Kendrick Lamar, with the latter name-checking his peers with the scorched earth purism of Edward Snowden. Within three hours of it leaking, edits had been made to expunge any trace of Sean or Electronica. Within several days, Tumblr had been converted into an infinite “Control” meme. Kendrick’s “King of New York” line prompted responses from New York rappers as futile as attacking Gozer with blades of grass. It sparked a beef between Kendrick and Drake, “the soft rapper he tucked into his pajama clothes.” LeBron James tweeted: \"This is real hip hop at his best! We going crazy over here people!!” Phil Jackson even took a break from meditating atop a totem pole to gently lecture about the value of mentorship. This wasn’t the best Kendrick Lamar-featured song of 2013. That would be “Jealous” with Fredo Santana or “Nosetalgia” with Pusha T. But it had the most impact—effectively ending the rap “Super Friends” era and ensuring that being “Controlled” replaced “Renegaded” and “Ethered” in the lexicon of verbs of mass destruction. You can’t inherit the rap throne; it’s something you have to usurp. And this was the sound of King Kendrick annexing new lands, sticking his flag into the hearts of men. —Jeff Weiss Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories succeeded because it was both a little bit of everything and a unified album statement. They picked up Paul Williams for theatrical bombast (\"Touch\"), Julian Casablancas for robo-cool (\"Instant Crush\"), and Todd Edwards for yacht rock (\"Fragments of Time\"). To get some indie pop into the mix they called upon Animal Collective’s Panda Bear, whose previous guest spots usually sounded much better in concept than execution. Not this time, though. The track Daft Punk built around him plays perfectly to his strengths, taking his genius with short, catchy, and repetitive melodic phrases and building a hooky mid-tempo electro-pop tune out of them. A little bit of joy, a little bit of yearning, a whole lot of simplicity: night, right, magic, and everybody’s dancing. \"Doin’ It Right\" is the album’s best example of machine precision grafted onto gentle human warmth. —Mark Richardson The title track of an album named after single-minded focus turned out to be a magicianly exercise in distraction. When Deerhunter debuted \"Monomania\" on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, the sleight of hand was almost literal: Wigged frontman Bradford Cox's fingers were disturbingly bandaged, and the camera followed him as he walked offstage, snatched someone's water, and waited for an elevator rather than finish out his vocals. On Monomania, too, the insistent repetitions, white noise, and motorcycle sound effects at the end of the song could turn attention away from the rest of its Bible-belted longing, ostensibly for another man. And just what was Cox being so monomaniacal about, anyway? Wasn't this a sloppy, tossed-off return to some garage-punk ideal? True enough, the song has a scabrous bloodthirstiness not heard from the Atlanta band since 2009 bonus album Weird Era Cont. But often overlooked is how it carries out that record's vision of a \"cassette cathedral.\" Not your fact-checking older cuz's lo-fi, \"Monomania\" epitomizes the way Deerhunter \"strung together a bunch of eight-tracks so they were like microphones\" for Monomania, building a magnificently detailed sonic edifice without losing that grainy demo-lover's aesthetic. Pals the Black Keys called this approach \"transcend-fi,\" but that too potentially distracts. And that's just it: Refusing to distinguish romantic obsession from musical fixation, provocation from hooks, and finally (\"mono, monomania...\") sense from nonsense, \"Monomania\" is where Deerhunter make a junkyard-art point so undeniable they had to point away from it for it to be understood. —Marc Hogan FKA twigs told an interviewer earlier this year that she dashed off the lyrics and melody to \"Water Me\", the eeriest ballad of 2013, \"in about seven minutes,\" just double the length of the song itself. On one hand, this feat is totally comprehensible; plenty of iconic songs were written quickly, and \"Water Me\" is filled with cavernous space, thanks in large part to twigs' now-Yeezus-credentialed collaborator Arca. On the other, considering how potent the song's simple lyrics actually are, that she flung them on a page in just minutes seems almost too good to be true. Haunting and heartbroken, \"Water Me\" is abandonment embodied; it floats detached and orbiting in space, frozen, yet perpetually falling. The devastation is palpable, but so is the despairing realism, the one that made the song strike home this year, amidst myriad defeats concerning sexuality and rights: there is no vindication here, nor may there be tomorrow. Twigs' pain is small and guarded, but it is direct, and it echoes. In the song's video, she sheds a solitary thick, plasmic tear as she sings, \"I promise I can grow tall/ When making love is free.\" Such a deeply rooted, elemental sentiment hints that perhaps \"Water Me\" wasn't such a difficult song to write after all. —Devon Maloney Just to fuck with you, Kanye West capped off the barbed-wire Yeezus with soulful outlier “Bound 2”, a taste of what Yeezus could’ve been or maybe was at one point in time but now will never be. To make things worse, he then performed the song on \"Jimmy Fallon\" and took it into an even livelier place—what we thought was a single underground tunnel to sunlight might have actually been an entire underground network of fluorescent caves that not even James Turrell could dream up. But, because he’s never done, Yeezus then threw the eephus, gifting the world the bizarre and uncanny “Bound 2” video which, whatever you think of it, and thanks to a little outside help, is a lock to be the most memorable visual of this year or next. On an album that takes itself awful seriously throughout, “Bound 2” is something that recontextualizes the entire affair, leaving more questions than answers. Is there a backlog of similarly-angled, soul-dappled B-sides sitting in a studio (or penthouse suite) somewhere? Is Charlie Wilson the secret weapon of the year? What would Jeromey Rome think? Did Kanye just make an album about his penis? “Bound 2” is Kanye’s last laugh. We ain’t got the answers. —Corban Goble",
    "LabBody": "93. David Bowie announced the release of The Next Day, the album he’d spent three years shaping in secrecy, on his 66th birthday, only two weeks into this year. The record’s continued rollout throughout 2013 suggested that, despite his age, Bowie was an old legend interested in new tricks. Chief among them was a 3xCD collector’s version. It followed much later in the year, keying on new songs and, most saliently, a 10-minute remix of The Next Day’s coming-of-age terror tale, “Love Is Lost”, by Bowie acolyte James Murphy. With the single and its edit, Bowie effectively joined the remix and YouTube masses. Murphy’s longest remix in a decade, his rendering is both reverent and revisionist. (He references composer Steve Reich in the title, largely because he turns the sound of a crowd clapping into a rhythm that shifts in phase against the rest of the music at the start. That idea comes from the minimalist’s own “Clapping Music”). He uses every verse and refrain here, and he repurposes the tune’s anxious organ. But Bowie’s rock original gives way to Murphy’s vivified disco, as he rearranges the song’s order entirely and leans more heavily on its central lament than its actual narrative: “Oh what have you done?” he implores Bowie to repeat above colorful keyboard splashes and a springy beat that builds up only for its own comedown. It’s posed less as a question of blame and less as one of general despair: What are you going to leave behind, exactly? —Grayson Haver Currin.

Their response? Putin and chums decided to introduce a “straight” flag. Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia, but Putin introduced a law in 2013 that bans symbols which promote “non-traditional” values. So, to fight back against the LGBT movement’s flag, the United Russia Party unveiled a banner celebrating the so-called traditional, nuclear Russian family. The flag depicts two parents – a woman and a man – holding hands with three children. It was unveiled at a party rally in Moscow’s Sokolniki park on the Day of Family, Love and Fidelity, an annual country-wide celebration held on July 8. The flag was launched alongside the hashtag #realfamily. Speaking to the Izvestia newspaper, Andrei Lisovenko, deputy head of the United Russia branch in Moscow, said: This is our response to same-sex marriage, to this mockery of the concept of the family.

    "DiffbotBody": "Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. And with that, here is how I view the first round. 1. Tampa Bay Bucs - QB Jameis Winston, FSU - I still think Marcus Mariota has a chance to be selected here, much more than given credit for. As Yahoo's Charles Robinson reported, the Glazers have final say in signing off on Winston. But mocks are for what I think will happen, and most signs still point to Jameis. Winston can be a quality starter in the NFL. 2. Tennessee Titans - WR Amari Cooper, Alabama - A shocker, I know. No QB, no trade - I think the connection between Jacksonville and Cooper is permeating to push the move into fruition. My twitter friend Thomas Gower thinks Cooper would be the receiver pick over Kevin White. From a receiver style this does not make a ton of sense, but from a “safe” and projectable traits stance it does. 3. Jacksonville Jaguars - DL Leonard Williams, USC - Everyone is mocking an edge rusher here. I bet the Jaguars think they can get their edge rusher, for the role he will play, in the second round (Eli Harold, for example). Yes, the team signed Jared Odrick to play either the big end or 3 technique. I think the team is concerned with Sen’Derrick Marks’ availability early in the season. Marks’ contract is also very easy to move on from, if necessary. Adding another versatile piece up front that could be viewed as “safe” makes sense. 4. Cleveland Browns (via Oakland Raiders) - QB Marcus Mariota, Oregon - This one is going to get a bit complicated, but stay with me. The first part of the deal is obvious. Here is the hypothetical trade, via Alan Dandar: Yes, I know the Jimmy Johnson chart is outdated. But for this purpose, let's use it. Some teams still refer to it as a comparable. For the Browns: After the GM and owner made the wrong quarterback choice last year, there is pressure to make the decision right. Mariota will do just that. 5. Washington Redskins - OL Brandon Scherff, Iowa - Mimicking the recent approach of a division rival. I bet many teams will think Scherff is this year’s Zack Martin. Some might think this is early for a guard. Maybe, but acquiring prospects with traits that translate is paramount. 6. New York Jets - T Andrus Peat, Stanford - Links have sprouted in recent days placing Peat to the Jets as a long term replacement for D’Brickashaw Ferguson. It makes sense. The question is where Peat plays in 2015 before moving to left tackle in 2016. The Jets have had guard issues. 7. Oakland Raiders (via Chicago Bears) - EDGE Alvin Dupree, Kentucky - After trading down, the Raiders trade back up to land their target. Again, via Alan Dandar, here is the second hypothetical trade: This leaves the Raiders with picks 7, 19 and 71 in the first three rounds, basically converting a second round pick into pick No. 19 by just moving down a few slots. Dupree’s play on the field does not warrant a selection this early, but due to the “upside” I would be surprised if Bud isn’t a top three edge rusher selected. 8. Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Dante Fowler, Florida - There are plenty of connections here. Namely, the position need and Dan Quinn’s history with Fowler. Fowler is very active with his hand and length use to create separation. I bet he is the standard top edge rusher on most teams’ boards. 9. New York Giants - WR Kevin White, WVU - Another WR for the Giants? It seems the team focuses on OL, WR and pass rushers early on. The prospects left at two of those positions do not fit the Giants’ types.Rueben Randle is average and has one year left. Victor Cruz is coming off injury. The team did give a large contract to Dwayne Harris, but he would be best inside. White and OBJ would be quite a tandem. 10. St. Louis Rams - OL La’El Collins, LSU - I have no idea how to approach La’El’s projection. So, I will just keep it where it is. If the Rams select Collins, who plays LT? Either way, you have two powerful blockers along the offensive line in an offense that will need to keep its quarterback clean in the pocket and open running lanes. 11. Minnesota Vikings - CB Trae Waynes, Michigan State - Everything points to the Vikings selecting a cornerback. So will it happen? I could see one of three names: Waynes, Byron Jones and Kevin Johnson. Waynes is a press corner (or man in his zone) who uses length and frame to stick with receivers and combat the catch point. 12. Chicago Bears (via Raiders and Browns) - DT Danny Shelton, Washington - The Bears drop down only a few spots and exchange a third for a second and a six for a five. Look at pick No. 7 for more details. The team does not have a natural fit at nose tackle, and Shelton has consistently said the Bears have Browns have displayed the most interest in him. 13. New Orleans Saints - EDGE Vic Beasley, Clemson - My buddy Tony Pauline recently stated the Saints are very interested in Beasley. Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16. Houston Texans - CB Byron Jones, UConn - When I look at the Texans I see a glaring need at corner with Johnathan Joseph likely entering his last year with the team. But why is it not frequently mocked in the first round. The NFL like Jones more than I do. continue story » Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. 17. San Diego Chargers - RB Melvin Gordon III, Wisconsin - Two running backs in the top 20? Let’s destroy the narrative, NFL. Again, I’ll bring back the “foundation piece” logic. A team could look at other non-RB talents in this class and view them as role players. Then they could look at a ball carrier 18. Kansas City Chiefs - LB Eric Kendricks, UCLA - The Chiefs have to improve their inside linebackers. With so much talent up front, Kendricks would thrive in Kansas City. Add in the fact Derrick Johnson is in a contract year coming off injury, and it makes a lot of sense. 19. Oakland Raiders (via Cleveland Browns) - WR Breshad Perriman, UCF - Receiver is still a need for the Raiders. If they want Derek Carr to stretch the field more this year, they need a receiver with those intermediate and downfield skills. Perriman has them. 20. Philadelphia Eagles - OL Donovan Smith, Penn State - Surprise? Smith checks all the boxes the Eagles (apparently) look for: Senior Bowler, athletic and visited the team’s facility. I don’t love Smith’s game, but teams who do likely think he can play guard and tackle. They must be able to unpack the traits he offers. 21. Cincinnati Bengals - T D.J. Humphries, Florida - I don’t love this fit. However, both of the Bengals’ tackles are entering contract years. Humphries, Cedric Ogbuehi, Ereck Flowers, etc. are all options. Humphries has added weight during the draft process and now sits above 300 pounds. 22. Pittsburgh Steelers - CB Kevin Johnson, Wake Forest - Kevin Johnson could be selected much earlier. The Wake Forest corner has awareness and finds the football in both man and zone situations. There is little wasted movement to his game and he attacks the catch point. 23. Detroit Lions - DT Grady Jarrett, Clemson - Grady is not just a 1 technique. Yes, he can play it in the NFL and di at Clemson, but expect him to play a lot of 3 technique in the NFL. He will be an upfield disruptor from either spot while also holding his own against the run. He should be a first round pick, and the Lions have a need now and in the future. 24. Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Shane Ray, Missouri - This is a tough call, as Ray could easily land in the second round. He tested as a bad athlete (in the 22nd percentile for his position) but does maximize it on the field and possesses a great motor. Does that tape compensate for poor athleticism, a toe injury which might need surgery and a recent marijuana citation? I think Preston Smith and Owamagbe Odighizuwa are more talented prospects, but this isn’t an exercise in what I would do. 25. Carolina Panthers - LB Shaq Thompson, Washington - I know, where is the tackle? Cedric Ogbuehi makes a lot of sense. So does an edge rusher like Owa or Preston Smith. But Shaq’s comparison has been Thomas Davis all along, and the team needs TD’s long term replacement. Shaq can fill a coverage role early on in high percentage passing situations. 26. Baltimore Ravens - DL Arik Armstead, Oregon - Personally, I think Ozzie gets another great talent here. CB Marcus Peters is an obvious possibility. Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith.",

For the Browns: After the GM and owner made the wrong quarterback choice last year, there is pressure to make the decision right. Mariota will do just that. 5. Washington Redskins - OL Brandon Scherff, Iowa - Mimicking the recent approach of a division rival. I bet many teams will think Scherff is this year’s Zack Martin. Some might think this is early for a guard. Maybe, but acquiring prospects with traits that translate is paramount. 6. New York Jets - T Andrus Peat, Stanford - Links have sprouted in recent days placing Peat to the Jets as a long term replacement for D’Brickashaw Ferguson. It makes sense. The question is where Peat plays in 2015 before moving to left tackle in 2016. The Jets have had guard issues. 7. Oakland Raiders (via Chicago Bears) - EDGE Alvin Dupree, Kentucky - After trading down, the Raiders trade back up to land their target. Again, via Alan Dandar, here is the second hypothetical trade: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. This leaves the Raiders with picks 7, 19 and 71 in the first three rounds, basically converting a second round pick into pick No. 19 by just moving down a few slots. Dupree’s play on the field does not warrant a selection this early, but due to the “upside” I would be surprised if Bud isn’t a top three edge rusher selected. 8. Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Dante Fowler, Florida - There are plenty of connections here. Namely, the position need and Dan Quinn’s history with Fowler. Fowler is very active with his hand and length use to create separation. I bet he is the standard top edge rusher on most teams’ boards. 9. New York Giants - WR Kevin White, WVU - Another WR for the Giants? It seems the team focuses on OL, WR and pass rushers early on. The prospects left at two of those positions do not fit the Giants’ types.Rueben Randle is average and has one year left. Victor Cruz is coming off injury. The team did give a large contract to Dwayne Harris, but he would be best inside. White and OBJ would be quite a tandem. 10. St. Louis Rams - OL La’El Collins, LSU - I have no idea how to approach La’El’s projection. So, I will just keep it where it is. If the Rams select Collins, who plays LT? Either way, you have two powerful blockers along the offensive line in an offense that will need to keep its quarterback clean in the pocket and open running lanes. 11. Minnesota Vikings - CB Trae Waynes, Michigan State - Everything points to the Vikings selecting a cornerback. So will it happen? I could see one of three names: Waynes, Byron Jones and Kevin Johnson. Waynes is a press corner (or man in his zone) who uses length and frame to stick with receivers and combat the catch point. 12. Chicago Bears (via Raiders and Browns) - DT Danny Shelton, Washington - The Bears drop down only a few spots and exchange a third for a second and a six for a five. Look at pick No. 7 for more details. The team does not have a natural fit at nose tackle, and Shelton has consistently said the Bears have Browns have displayed the most interest in him. 13. New Orleans Saints - EDGE Vic Beasley, Clemson - My buddy Tony Pauline recently stated the Saints are very interested in Beasley. Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16. Houston Texans - CB Byron Jones, UConn - When I look at the Texans I see a glaring need at corner with Johnathan Joseph likely entering his last year with the team. But why is it not frequently mocked in the first round. The NFL like Jones more than I do. ~ Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. 17. San Diego Chargers - RB Melvin Gordon III, Wisconsin - Two running backs in the top 20? Let’s destroy the narrative, NFL. Again, I’ll bring back the “foundation piece” logic. A team could look at other non-RB talents in this class and view them as role players. Then they could look at a ball carrier. 18. Kansas City Chiefs - LB Eric Kendricks, UCLA - The Chiefs have to improve their inside linebackers. With so much talent up front, Kendricks would thrive in Kansas City. Add in the fact Derrick Johnson is in a contract year coming off injury, and it makes a lot of sense. 19. Oakland Raiders (via Cleveland Browns) - WR Breshad Perriman, UCF - Receiver is still a need for the Raiders. If they want Derek Carr to stretch the field more this year, they need a receiver with those intermediate and downfield skills. Perriman has them. 20. Philadelphia Eagles - OL Donovan Smith, Penn State - Surprise? Smith checks all the boxes the Eagles (apparently) look for: Senior Bowler, athletic and visited the team’s facility. I don’t love Smith’s game, but teams who do likely think he can play guard and tackle. They must be able to unpack the traits he offers. 21. Cincinnati Bengals - T D.J. Humphries, Florida - I don’t love this fit. However, both of the Bengals’ tackles are entering contract years. Humphries, Cedric Ogbuehi, Ereck Flowers, etc. are all options. Humphries has added weight during the draft process and now sits above 300 pounds. 22. Pittsburgh Steelers - CB Kevin Johnson, Wake Forest - Kevin Johnson could be selected much earlier. The Wake Forest corner has awareness and finds the football in both man and zone situations. There is little wasted movement to his game and he attacks the catch point. 23. Detroit Lions - DT Grady Jarrett, Clemson - Grady is not just a 1 technique. Yes, he can play it in the NFL and di at Clemson, but expect him to play a lot of 3 technique in the NFL. He will be an upfield disruptor from either spot while also holding his own against the run. He should be a first round pick, and the Lions have a need now and in the future. 24. Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Shane Ray, Missouri - This is a tough call, as Ray could easily land in the second round. He tested as a bad athlete (in the 22nd percentile for his position) but does maximize it on the field and possesses a great motor. Does that tape compensate for poor athleticism, a toe injury which might need surgery and a recent marijuana citation? I think Preston Smith and Owamagbe Odighizuwa are more talented prospects, but this isn’t an exercise in what I would do. 25. Carolina Panthers - LB Shaq Thompson, Washington - I know, where is the tackle? Cedric Ogbuehi makes a lot of sense. So does an edge rusher like Owa or Preston Smith. But Shaq’s comparison has been Thomas Davis all along, and the team needs TD’s long term replacement. Shaq can fill a coverage role early on in high percentage passing situations. 26. Baltimore Ravens - DL Arik Armstead, Oregon - Personally, I think Ozzie gets another great talent here. CB Marcus Peters is an obvious possibility. Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith. continue story » Josh Norris is an NFL Draft Analyst for Rotoworld and contributed to the Rams scouting department during training camp of 2010 and the 2011 NFL Draft.

This is a story about one media company branching out into the digital world by developing and marketing its own CMS (content management system), responsive Web sites, and apps. If content is king, than entire business should be aligned to ensure seamless content delivery to readers. What does that mean? It means that you need to establish simple yet solid infrastructure and processes that guides staff’s content to the market. The problem here is finding a good CMS that helps facilitate that. Sure, there are some great solutions for soccer moms blogging about their muffin recipes and products that are too complex for their own good. But that’s not what you need in the newsroom. That is your new revenue opportunity. So ... Define the problem: Lack of great CMS solutions for media companies available on the market.

Multi-site and multi-platform management that allows journalists to share content easily. Reader behaviour analytics that help editors make better content related decisions. It’s a good idea to test and pilot products internally on a smaller scale before going to the market. Our challenge was to design interface with (almost) no learning curve, since a big portion of our content creators aren’t tech-savy.

Do you have some specific examples? Also, you might be interested in what our Founding Fathers had to say about separation of Church and State: “If I could conceive that the general government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.” - George Washing...See More Richard Boyle · San Francisco, California Nelda White White: Those rights are \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

    "DiffbotBody": "The rules changed when the Reserve Bank cut rates in May. The impact of that cut will be significant in the next round of bank earnings and executives are already spending a lot of time strategising around their response to the next reduction in official rates that economists are tipping for the second half. ANZ Banking Group threw everyone out by moving first with the decision to pass on in full the RBA's interest rate cut in May. That abruptly ended a move 2½ years earlier to break with tradition and take a more independent approach by reviewing rates on the second Friday of each month. Customer feedback prompts decision Times have changed since then and funding markets are no longer as tough. ANZ also said it made the decision in response to customer feedback. National Australia Bank's chief Andrew Thorburn has also chosen not to adopt his predecessor's approach to undercutting the other banks by offering the best interest rate. ANZ's standard variable rate of 5.38 per cent is currently the lowest of the four banks. Low interest rates cost the banks a lot of money and they have to provision for the impact. The next cut will come at time the banks are implementing new funding requirements and trying to meet the banking regulator's push to slow investor loan growth. It is unlikely they will pass on further cuts, even if that risks attracting another telling off by Treasurer Joe Hockey. JPMorgan says banks must be careful in the way they manage competition, warning against a blanket repricing of the mortgage portfolio. \"Blanket repricing of the mortgage portfolio, [such as] out-of-cycle rate rises during the GFC, is a lazy response and may be detrimental to longer-run return prospects for the portfolio,\" JPMorgan analyst Scott Manning says. The more pressing issue for banking executives is how to respond to regulatory pressure to manage the boom in housing prices and curb investor lending. Home buyers are already noticing the difference as discounts and promotions for investor loans dry up, while the conditions for owner-occupier loans are sweetened. Banks curb investor loans Banks are in the odd position of curbing their investor loans books following a push by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) to keep investor loan growth under 10 per cent. There are early signs it is working, although there are questions about whether targeting people buying investment properties is really taking the risk out of the market. First home owners who do not have existing properties to use as collateral will face the biggest challenge. Mortgage brokers also believe the current sharemarket rout in China will see more foreign investors parking their money into the Australian housing market. Figures out on Friday showed the number of home loan approvals fell 6.1 per cent in May. Investment lending on a seasonally adjusted basis fell by 3.2 per cent. These numbers do not reflect the drastic move announced by Westpac this week to introduce an 80 per cent loan-to-valuation cap on investor loans. This means people wanting to borrow money from the bank for an investment property will have to pay a 20 per cent deposit. That could amount to as much as $200,000 for a home in Sydney, where the median price is approaching a ludicrous $1 million. The deposit required is 10 per cent for ANZ and Westpac compared with 5 per cent previously. Broker Mortgage Choice has data showing investment loan approvals fell from 33 per cent 29 per cent to June but overall lending is not coming off. Packer plays odds While odds are in favour of Echo Entertainment winning its latest stoush with James Packer in Brisbane, there are whispers the Crown Resorts camp has some last-minute tricks up its sleeve. One carrot being offered to the Queensland government is a proposal to abolish the existing buyback arrangement for poker machine licences, which has been in place since 2001. Casino operators, clubs, pubs and hotels are not allowed to buy licences off each other at the moment, although there is a tender process for each industry group to sell to each other. While hotels are paying as much as $130,000 per licence, prices are volatile and the clubs are more strapped for cash and are offering a lot less than that. The industry associations do not want Crown to win, fearing it will lead to an influx of new competition that will hurt their businesses. Crown will try and sell the buyback idea as a solution for struggling pubs or clubs who can make some money and get rid of the dusty poker machine sitting in the corner without increasing the overall number of licences in the state. It is only one factor in the high-stakes game that will be played out in Brisbane this week, although some believe the decision has already been made. Taxes, employment opportunities, reputations and benefits to the community are all issues the working panel assessing the bids will have to look at. As Echo knows, Crown is a formidable opponent and it could still go either way. But if I had to put money on an outcome I would pick Echo. Twitter @MikeSmithAFR",

Big banks have been juggling the need to protect profit margins, winning new customers and government pressure to curb investor lending; first home buyers feel the pinch. The banks have been a little cheeky in the way they quietly unwound a bump-up in deposit account interest rates offered to consumers earlier this year. The May decision to lift rates on some deposit accounts was a trade-off from a public relations perspective for not passing on the latest official interest rate cuts in full. It emerged this week that both Commonwealth Bank and Westpac were no longer offering those promotional discounts. But times are tougher than usual for the banks and both CBA and Westpac can argue those discounts were only ever going to be in place for a short time. The promotional offer simply expired and the banks chose not to renew them. Lifting deposit rates for a limited time is one of the strategies the big banks have been deploying as they juggle the need to protect profit margins against winning new customers.

    "LabBody": "A new Change.org petition is adding a little fuel to the fire and stirring controversy on the conversation of race relations in America. The petition, started by Ryan Koch of Des Moines, Iowa, asks “us European Americans” to protest Cracker Barrel because it claims the restaurant known for its savory southern cuisine and country store “uses an offensive slur” and “is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage.” “The name is offensive,” the petition which currently has nearly 8,000 signers says. Koch says he started the satirical petition in response to “media reports of various groups and organizations constantly wanting to change things throughout the country because they claim they are offended.” He says the petition was meant to shed light on what he sees as political correctness in America. Koch feels there are more important issues the media should focus on such as crime, unemployment, veteran suicide, and corruption in politics. To be clear, Koch says the petition “is strictly for satirical and comedic purposes\" and “to show how ridiculous political correctness is getting in America.” Why is there a petition for Cracker Barrel to change their name because white people are offended. I'm literally screaming.— C. Lauren (@CarleyIauren_) July 10, 2015. Cracker Barrel responded to our request for comment on the petition with this statement: \"Cracker Barrel is aware of this satirical petition and recognizes that individuals have the right to express their opinion on all types of things. At Cracker Barrel, our mission is Pleasing People. While we respect the opinions of these individuals, our brand is well-known as a home away from home so we have no plans to change our name as it is synonymous with great food and great service.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "GC: You won't be surprised to hear I've yet to find it given the amount of choice on offer. All I can do is sit on the fence as I go through the formbook ahead of a bumper day tomorrow, but I'll have to get off it in the morning as I'm on the Morning Line with Frankie Dettori and Brazen Beau's trainer Chris Waller, two excellent guests. Have a great weekend folks, thanks for all your questions. All the best, GC. GC: A tricky one, Pete. I've never quite gone along with the notion that he's a real crackerjack sprinter but there's always a chance that will be wrong. William Haggas seems to be concerned about the undulations, but overall I wonder whether his close third in that King's Stand was quite good enough to win a race like this. Paul Hanagan has understandably looked elsewhere with Muhaarar and it looks a good decision. GC: There's every chance at least one longshot will hit the frame but it's tough to say which one that might be. I can't back Sole Power given he's 0 from 10 over six furlongs and Anthem Alexander shouldn't be able to beat Muhaarar on Ascot running. G Force has plenty to prove and it wouldn't surprise me if Astaire showed up really well at a big price. I realise he's just under two lengths to find with Brazen Beau on Diamond Jubilee form but he showed excellent speed and that might be seen to better advantage given the way this track seems to be riding at the moment. GC: It's really tough, but I think I have to just edge towards Muhaarar. Everything about his Commonwealth Cup romp suggests he's thriving at the moment and he also receives 6lb in weight-for-age from Brazen Beau even though he's just a half year rather than full year younger than the Aussie who was foaled in the southern hemisphere. He'd be my tentative choice to beat the star Aussie raider in exactly the same way his sire Oasis Dream did against Choisir all the way back in 2003. GC: He's drawn 15 of 15 for the second time in a row. Like you, I can't be sure that racing alone cost him at Ascot, but it's clear he ran an excellent race and once again all the vibes from connections have been very positive. You have to wonder if the shape of the race will be against him. He's clearly fast and capable of going his own way, but the stalls are towards the stands' rail tomorrow which means he will be right out in the centre with the other speed horses Danzeno and Astaire drawn well inside him in stalls four and eight respectively. I'd love to see him win as the sport in general benefits from big time International competition but my confidence hasn't increased with the news he's out on a limb again. James: Hi, How much of an impact do you feel the ride Brazen Beau received at Ascot actually had? The trainer said it didn't, I personally agree with that thought. He did race away from the rest of the pack down the near side but if anything he didn't have a troubled passage like he may have done more centrally. James Doyle takes over the ride and his style should suit this racecourse, any thoughts GC? GC: I've had a pretty good look at the race and Bronze Angel each-way is my pick. Firm Decisions is sure to be bang there for a long way towards the stands' rail but Bronze Angel has a tremendous record in these major handicaps and he ran a screamer in the Hunt Cup, travelling powerfully behind a strong gallop and that bodes well. I've no idea whether his outside draw in stall 20 will be a problem, but I'm confident he's fully effective at seven furlongs and he's just 2lb higher than the mark he won off at Ascot last season. GC: And to you, Chris B. The draw really shouldn't be a major concern at York nowadays. The issue of too many good meetings on one day is a more contentious one and I think my ideal choice would be for the July Festival to move back to Weds-Fri. That said people in racing really do seem able to make a negative out of a positive. We'll have ten terrific live races on C4 tomorrow with about £1.2million in prize-money and 100,000 people likely to be in attendance at York, Chester, Ascot and HQ. That's something to be proud of for the sport as a whole so I'll focus on that and let the bureaucrats decide if and when to shift Newmarket back to its former slot. Chris B: Good morning Graham. Packed programme tomorrow and exciting racing but Imo there are too many big meetings in one day. I am at York for the John smiths cup but because of the July cup the limelight has been taken away from York a little bit. I think it should be a standalone meeting. What are your thoughts? Anyway onto the John smiths do you have a strong fancy for the race? I like look of Arab dawn. Is stall 13 ideal or a little wide. I would have preferred a slightly lower draw. good luck to all tomorrow GC: You've summed it up very neatly Mick. So many of these have taken each other on on a regular basis and with so little to choose between so many runners a bit of luck here and there could be very important. However, I would be inclined to turn a blind eye if people start bashing on about the draw. Loads of horses have won from high draws on the round course in recent times and this race last year saw stall 22 beat stall 18 in a surprisingly steadily run race where very little got into it from off the pace. I hope we don't see a similarly tactical race tomorrow and the stronger they go the keener I'll be on Ajman Bridge. GC: Hope so Harry, but not necessarily with Mount Logan. He could be well-handicapped but I'm hoping Ajman Bridge is set for a big run. I am slightly concerned his coming back in trip a little, but he's well-handicapped racing from the same perch as when pipped by Aran Dawn racing over 1m4f at Ascot. It's clearly just too tough to have a major bet, but it looks like Kirby has chosen Ajman Bridge over Mount Logan and I hope he's right. GC: This looks a really tough race but it's also a cracker and we should get a good gallop with Arabian Queen, Euro Charline and Fintry in there. I've nothing negative to say about Lucida. She was slightly unlucky in both the Guineas and Coronation Stakes for different reasons. That said, the French look very powerful here and I'm drawn towards Avenir Certain at a slightly bigger price. She's a dual Classic winner with a really good turn of foot when she's on song and she stayed on powerfully under a very tender ride at Chantilly last time. Faster ground here poses a new question but they have watered overnight and with Soumillon replacing Benoit she should go well. GC: Hope so Ji. I was really impressed by her Queen Mary performance and she acted like a filly who should be effective over six. Fellow Ascot filly Illuminate is clearly the danger, but she's worth watching beforehand given that Richard Hannon has suggested she could get lit up (pardon the pun) in the preliminaries. EA holds several of these on Ascot form and if she reaches the same level today she'll be very hard to beat. GC: They certainly are flying. Resonant showed yesterday that the Braveheart horses just bounce back and bounce back. That said, Rah Rah might be in a bit deep here. The winner Acapulco wasn't drawn far away from her in the Queen Mary and on that line of form she's plenty on to reverse form with Easton Angel. GC: You won't be the only one Tony. That maiden came after C4 had gone off air but this Braveheart filly came with a major reputation and lived up to it and then some. She powered clear with precious little assistance needed from William Buick. Her final time was six lengths slower than Shalaa in the July Stakes, but she recorded by far the fastest final two furlong split of the day in a performance described by Timeform's Simon Rowlands as 'mustard or possibly even hot mustard.' In short, she looks a Pattern race winner waiting to happen and she will have no problem getting further down the line. GC: Good question, Ian. The July Stakes has been won by plenty of horses that have gone on to win more good races, often at Glorious Goodwood, and it's also worth remembering last year's renewal saw Dewhurst winner Belardo and Commonwealth Cup hero Muhaarar get turned over by Ivawood. I'm sure there's plenty of room at the top for more changes among the 2yo colts and Shalaa is bang up there. It was the second best juvenile Timeform time figure (115) behind the Queen Mary winner Acapulco. I'm pretty sure there are a few big stables with good colts that haven't shown their hand yet but Shalaa has the potential to win another big one over six or possibly seven furlongs. GC: I certainly couldn't have found him. As regards Spencer's ride, it was clearly nicely judged but the times certainly don't suggest that he nicked the race in any way in fact, Big Orange went faster than Mr Singh at practically every split until the closing stages and I just think that the winner belatedly blossomed on the sort of wide-galloping course that suits his style perfectly. GC: Depends completely on what turns up, Phil. John Gosden has the best 3yos around but half of them won't be going anywhere near Town Moor. Storm The Stars heads the market at the moment based on his Epsom third and Curragh second. Aidan O'Brien has a posse of possible contenders who could improve before September too, so at this stage Mr Singh should be considered as a smart colt with room for more improvement. But it's hard to argue what he achieved at Newmarket against 90-odd rated horses yesterday marked him out as a potential Classic winner. GC: I think a lot will depend on how he fares if he goes to the Arc. I must admit I haven't taken too much notice of the ratings debate. I saw Frankel had the same rating at the same stage but that side of things make less appeal then they used to. The main thing is we see him as often as possible before he does retire and if he does win a King George and an Arc then he's going to compare favourably with the rest... barring Frankel as a 4yo of course. GC: I'm pretty sure he'll be fully effective over both distances after last week. A bigger field would clearly have been ideal but it was great to see him beat The Grey Gatsby so convincingly in the end and to have an unbeaten Derby winner is a terrific boost to any Flat season. It's a bit depressing to hear his owner making retirement plans already but he clearly sets the bar very high for the King George providing he stays on top of his game. If Jack Hobbs does too we're in for a very special Arc indeed.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Presidential aspirant and billionaire businessman Donald Trump, whose message on immigration is resonating among mainstream Americans – despite the fury of fellow Republicans, the press and Mexico – expressed doubts once again about the site of President Obama’s birth, while answering a question from a CNN reported. “I don’t know. I really don’t know,” Trump said, when asked by CNN if he thought Obama had been born in America. “I don’t know why he wouldn’t release his records.” At the same time, Trump said he didn’t want to make Obama’s birth the focus of his presidential campaign.

I’m about doing the right thing for this country.” Trump has been outspoken in the past about his doubts over Obama’s place of birth – but he’s hardly the only one. Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio said in a radio interview just a few days ago he doubted the validity of Obama’s birth certificate, released under pressure in 2011. As WND reported, Arpaio said on a Sunday chat on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio” on New York’s AM 970: “I’ve been in law enforcement 55 years. I think I know a fraudulent, fake document. I’m not a computer expert, I rely on my people. But I’m pretty well convinced it’s a fake document.” The matter of Obama’s birth surfaced generated more questions in late 2013, after a key official who provided a copy of the document Obama presented as his birth certificate – a document seen by some as fake – was killed in a plane crash. Hawaii’s state Health Department chief Loretta Fuddy, who waived state prohibitions and turned over a copy of the document Obama released to the public, was killed in December 2013, as WND previously reported. Just a few months before that crash, Trump had been pressing hard for proof of Obama’s birth. In an August 2013 interview on “This Week” on ABC, he told host Jonathan Karl: “Was there a birth certificate? You tell me. Some people say that was not his birth certificate. I’m saying I don’t know. Nobody knows.” Polls show many in the public still have doubts about Obama’s birth. In February 2014, an Economist/YouGov poll showed 61 percent of those asked if “Obama was born in the United States” expressed doubts. And 15 percent in the same poll outright said they’re positive Obama wasn’t born in the country. The significance is that the Constitution requires a president to be a “natural-born citizen,” and there are those who say that would exclude someone who was born overseas. The Constitution itself does not define “natural-born citizen,” but writings from the era when the Constitution was written suggest it would be the child of two citizen parents born in the country.",

Less than a week after urging his country to reject milder cuts in a referendum, the Greek Prime Minister is now asking his hard left Syriza party to effectively sign off on a dramatic U-turn. If backed by the party and accepted by creditors, the reforms would raise corporate and shipping tax, increase the country's 'luxury' tax and implement a levy on TV advertisements immediately. It pledged to complete the tender process for the privatisation of its regional airports, as well as ports in Piraeus, Thessaloniki and Hellinikon. The Government would also transfer its remaining shares in Greek telecoms companies into private hands. All of this comes just 10 days after 60 per cent of Greek voters said they opposed further austerity measures in the July 5 referendum - a position the country's hard left government supported. Scroll down for video The proposals were sent to rescue creditors for approval at emergency meetings of European Union leaders and finance ministers over the weekend. The proposed new bailout worth nearly €53.5 billion would be Greece's third since it lost market access in 2010. But in an unusual procedure, Tsipras is first seeking authorization from parliament to negotiate with the creditors based on the proposal in a vote Friday. He is essentially asking his Syriza party to sign off on the U-turn despite more than 60 percent of voters opposing more austerity in the July 5 referendum. Tsipras was convening his party's lawmakers for discussions Friday morning before the parliamentary debate. The coalition government has 162 seats in the 300-member parliament and pledged backing on a deal from a large section of opposition lawmakers. But failure to deliver votes from his own government would likely topple his coalition. A prominent dissenter, Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, urged the government not to sign a third bailout. 'The choices we have are tough ... but the worst, the most humiliating and unbearable choice is an agreement that will surrender, loot and subjugate our people and this country,' he told a business conference on Thursday, before the Greek proposal was finalized. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou said the austerity climb-down was the only way Greece could survive the current economic crisis. 'I think we have no other option (than to accept the creditors' claims). The other is to exit the eurozone but neither the society or the administration is prepared to do so. If you don't have a plan B then you have the accept the (stronger) force,' he said. Asked what the point in the holding a referendum was when the government U-turned on the terms only days later, Kouloglou said: 'The creditors wanted it in the first place. There's also a culture of reprisals here, people will be punished because they voted no to the creditors.' Speaking of Greece's proposal, the MEP said he thought the request to restructure Greece's debt repayments was key to the agreement, branding the current arrangement 'unsustainable'. Michael Fuchs, Germany deputy chairman of CDU told the programme: 'At the moment we are just studying it (the proposals) and we really have to make sure the debt sustainability is now served, if that is not functioning (then) it doesn't make sense.' 'We have to check whether these measures, these new rules which they have proposed, are capable to really serve that idea. It's very important that we go forward but it's not our mistake or our fault. The Greeks have been waiting days to come up with proposals and now we have to check it.' I have a problem to trust it. What's the difference between Sunday and today? On Sunday the Greek people voted against these measurements, and against all these kinds of increases of VAT and (things like) all this. Now what is the situation? I'm sorry,' Beating a midnight deadline by almost two hours, the spokesman for Dutch eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem tweeted that the proposals were received and that it was 'important for institutions to consider these in their assessment' of the Greek situation. News the plans have been finalised comes as the country's Prime minister Alexis Tsipras met with finance ministry officials a day after the government requested a new three-year aid programme from Europe's bailout funds - and promised to immediately enact reforms, including to taxes and pensions, in return. Earlier yesterday, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici had warned it was a 'decisive' day for Europe. He had stated he was hopeful a new Greek bailout deal was possible, in exchange for 'concrete, complete' reform proposals. 'I have the sense that the dialogue is established, or restored, and that there is a way out,' Mr Moscovici said. Failure to reach a deal could be the first step towards Greece leaving the shared euro currency. The last-minute negotiations come amid bank closures in Greece, where capital controls have been imposed that restrict Greeks to cash withdrawals of 60 euro (£43) per day. The closures have been extended through to Monday. Pensioners without bank cards have been particularly hard hit as they have struggled to access their accounts. Certain bank branches opened last week to allow them to withdraw a weekly allowance of 120 euro each. The government announced on Wednesday this was being renewed so they could withdraw the same sum. Hundreds of elderly Greeks lined up outside banks yesterday morning. Hopes for a deal rose after Donald Tusk, who chairs the EU summits, said that Greece's plan would have to be matched by creditors' suggestions on how to make the country's debt manageable in the longer term. 'The realistic proposal from Greece will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,' Mr Tusk said. Easing the terms of Greece's existing bailout loans has been a key dividing issue in the bailout talks for months - with Greece and the International Monetary Fund pressing in favour and key European states like Germany resisting the idea. Greece's proposals will now be examined by the 'troika' of creditor institutions - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and IMF - before going on to political leaders. Mr Tusk, the former Polish premier, has set a special summit of all 28 European Union members on Sunday as the final deadline for a deal to bail out Greece and keep it in the European single currency. Greece's Leftist premier Tsipras has called for a reduction of Greece's massive €320 billion debt mountain to be part of any deal for its third international bailout since 2010. But Germany and many other eurozone nations reject any move to write off Greek debts, especially after Greeks in a referendum last weekend backed Tsipras's decision to reject the creditors' demands for further austerity. A spokesman for the European Commission said Wednesday that its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had called earlier this week for debt sustainability to be part of a Greek deal 'under the understanding that that would come later in October, provided that the other conditions would have been met.' IMF chief Christine Lagarde said Wednesday that a new programme to prop up Greece's finances would require creditors to restructure debt in addition to the reforms Athens must make. 'The other leg is debt restructuring, which we believe is needed in the case of Greece for it to have debt sustainability,' she told a conference in Washington. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew made similar comments, saying the IMF was right to focus on the issue and that Greece's debt 'is not sustainable.' But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after an emergency summit of the 19 nations that use the single currency on Tuesday that debt relief would be illegal under the EU's treaties. 'A haircut is out of question,' she said when asked about the possibility of restructuring Greek debt.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Four years ago, Cait Flanders, a personal finance writer in Vancouver who turns 30 tomorrow, pulled out her credit cards and faced the truth she had been avoiding for years: She was $25,000 CAD ($19,800 USD) in debt, and most of it had been frittered away. Student loans accounted for $4,500 CAD ($3,600 USD), but as for the rest? “I don’t have a great answer for it. I just lived a lifestyle I couldn’t afford,” she says. She wasn’t even a big shopper, and her rent, at $1,100 CAD ($870 USD), is below average for her city. It was mostly just inattention to her finances: “If my friends were going to dinner, I never wanted to say no. So even if that meant going out to dinner every day of the week, I said yes.” She started a blog, Blonde on a Budget, which now gets about 30,000 readers monthly, and after two years of scrimping — one haircut, no travel, no dining out, putting as much as 55% of her monthly income toward her debt — she was debt-free. Crush Credit Card Debt: An eBook From Forbes If running from the collection agencies isn’t your exercise of choice, read this book for tips and tricks on how to crush credit card debt. But afterward, she relaxed her budget. Though she didn’t fall back into debt, she would only save 8% of her monthly income even when she intended to put away 20%. She did hit that goal a few times that first year out of debt, but “considering I had once been doing without up to 55% of my income, that’s somewhat underwhelming,” she says. Then she saw a blog post by Mr. Money Mustache, a blogger who retired at age 30, in which he said that every permanent decrease in spending has a double benefit: it increases the amount of money you have each month to put into savings, plus it also lowers the amount you need every month for the rest of your life. Around the same time, her sister had boasted to her of saving 20% of her income. “I said, ‘Whoa whoa whoa — you live at home and are going to school. Do you need 80% of your income?’ And I thought, ‘Why don’t I give myself the same advice?’” she says. One day, not able to find little things — a can opener, a razor blade — in her one-bedroom apartment, she realized her cupboards were overflowing with junk. “I’m spending $5 here, $10 there … It’s nothing crazy — an extra lotion or shower gel — but then you have eight of them. I was consuming just for the sake of consuming. I thought, ‘I need to stop buying and just use up this stuff I already have.’” A month later (and a year ago today), she embarked upon a year-long shopping ban. Over the year, she got rid of 70% of her stuff, lived on just 51% of her income ($28,000 CAD, $22,000 USD), saved 31% (about $17,000 CAD, $13,500 USD) and traveled on the last 18%, with two trips to New York, one trip to New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and other trips to Portland, New Orleans, Denver and her hometown Victoria and Toronto several times each (total cost of travel: just under $10,000 CAD; $8,000 USD). Here’s how she did it. What were the rules of the shopping ban? There were two things I knew I had to stop buying. One was takeout coffee. When I was getting out of debt, I’d let myself have a small budget for coffee, but as soon as I was out of debt, I let myself get takeout coffee every single day. The other was books. I owned 50 books I hadn’t read, and yet I was constantly buying more of them. I also banned other mindless things — like, I used to buy a new nail polish but then actually wear it twice the entire year. I couldn’t buy candles, notebooks, magazines or electronics. I was not allowed to buy clothes, except for a couple things I realized at the beginning I would need. I did a massive declutter and realized how much stuff I never wore. I’ve always been someone who wear the same five things. So I challenged myself to live with a small number of items. What parts of the ban were most difficult? The first month was really tough because of the no coffee and the no books. It was fascinating to realize what my triggers were and the habits I’d built around both those things. With coffee, my habits were that if I was really tired in the morning, I’d tell myself it was OK to get takeout coffee. Not being able to do that was eye-opening, realizing how many times in the past I’d justified that purchase when it takes two minutes to make coffee. Also, if I was going to run errands, for some reason, I would always buy a latte beforehand. Buying books was a big one, because I’d want to buy a new book, but if you spend $25, you get free shipping, so I’d add extra books. It got worse when I got an e-reader because you don’t even swipe a card. Five months in, on black Friday, I almost broke my no new electronics rule. My e-reader is pretty busted. I have to use a pin to hit the reset button to turn it on. I saw the e-reader on sale for $40 or $50 and they’re only $100 so it was a huge discount, which never happens, so I convinced myself that I needed it. Within five seconds of purchasing it, I was like, what did you just do. Sure my e-reader is annoying, but it works. So I immediately canceled the order. And then I realized I barely use my e-reader. I didn’t use it for a month after that because I’d been borrowing books from the library. Why did you get rid of your stuff? One, I realized how much I already had. But also, I would see things I wasn’t wearing or all the books I hadn’t read yet, and it would make me feel bad. So I opened up every closet and drawer and pulled everything out and asked myself, ‘When was the last time I used this?’ ‘Am I actually going to use this in the next couple of months?’ If not, it had to go. Books were also interesting because I got rid of a bunch of books that I hadn’t read yet. I used to buy books because I wanted to portray a certain perception of myself, like I would be the kind of person who had read that book. But none of those actually interested me, so I got rid of those too. So, in the summer, I got rid of 43% of my stuff. How do you know it was 43%? I kept inventory. I’m not kidding — I actually wrote down how many things I kept and how many things I got rid of. I didn’t count things like 10 knives, but I did count things like pens. Pens are another thing you stockpile. I had 30-something pens, and I was like, I might run out of three a year, so I have 10 years’ worth of pens right now. So I donated the pens to one of the charities that gives to schools. I didn’t throw out very much unless it was socks that had holes in them or products that were used. I donated all my clothes to a store where the proceeds go to two charities in Vancouver. I donated all my books to the library. I sold a few things I knew I could get $100 for, like a juicer or an old camera. But about the 43% — that’s just how much I got rid of last summer. Throughout the entire year, I got rid of 70% of my stuff. I read a bunch of books on it, but they would talk about decluttering in the sense of organizing, so it would be like, declutter your home by buying storage solutions. But that’s not the problem — the problem is you have too much stuff. If you actually don’t use something, it takes up more mental clutter even than physical clutter. Before you started the blog, you went out to dinner all the time, but to pay off your debt, you stopped. Did that change your friendships? No — I didn’t have a problem saying to people, ‘Let’s do something at your house instead,’ or ‘Let’s have a barbecue.’ Once you suggest it, it’s surprising how many people will agree with you because, honestly, most people can’t go out as much as they think they can. They’re also thinking, yes, it would cost $5 or $10 instead of $30 to go out. It just changed the way I hung out with people — we’d go for coffee, walks or hikes. Once you started the ban, how did it affect your relationships if you were also no longer going out to get coffee with people? I never put a ban on going out for meals this year. The coffee ban was that I wasn’t allowed to get coffee by myself anymore to break a bad habit. I would still go out for meals, but only once a week, so maybe a couple dinners and a couple brunches in an entire month. I will say a lot of my friends think I’m crazy. Everyone is astounded I haven’t bought stuff for the year. They kind of think I’m a freak. The coolest thing is how many of my friends said, your shopping ban inspired me to not to make this impulse purchase. How much were you earning? When I started the blog, I was making about $50,000 CAD ($39,700 USD) and throughout this shopping ban, including freelancing, I’ve earned $73,000 CAD ($57,900 USD), though after taxes I took home $55,000 CAD ($43,700 USD). But as of yesterday, I’m a full-time freelancer. Wow! Congratulations! My leap into freelance has been a weird byproduct of this entire experience for the last year. I was always chasing career success, and I thought what I made annually would attach to that. Along with the shopping ban, I decided I wanted to live off 50% of my income, so I had this goal in mind and now I very comfortably live on $2,000 ($1,600 USD) a month — a very full and rich life. I realized it’s wonderful to earn money but my career success would be more dependent on whether or not I enjoyed what I was doing. Freelance is like the opposite of early retirement. I still have to work, I’m not living off savings, but when people retire early, it’s so they can work on the things they want to work on. Freelance is the same way. It’s a different kind of success, and one I’d rather go after. You decided to make the ban stricter halfway through the year. Why? When I started this job, I remember vividly saying, I was never going to become the kind of person who made their own cleaning products, I was just trying to spend less. But as time has gone on, the idea of making my own stuff interested me quite a bit, as does gardening and having vegetables and fruit I had grown myself. So I planted a garden and cut cleaning products in favor of creating my own from vinegar, lemon and baking soda. But since announcing that, I have been traveling a lot so I never ran out of the supplies I already had and never got to make my own cleaning stuff. And for that reason — I haven’t even announced this on my blog yet — I’m actually going to do the ban for two years. Really? Just so you can make your own cleaning supplies? Also because in the last few months, it almost became too easy. I don’t need anything. I never think about clothes or shoes or needing anything, so in some ways this will just be my lifestyle. But I just want to challenge myself again. So in the beginning, I’ll, again, create a short list of things I am allowed to buy throughout the year — like, since I wear the same clothes all the time, I do need more shirts. And more out of curiosity’s sake, I want to keep track of every single thing I buy — like every single toothpaste. I think it would be really eye-opening. You don’t need to buy a box of ten toothpastes. That’s probably a two-year supply. What intangible benefits did you get from the ban, whether psychological or spiritual or something else? I feel like the best version of myself right now. In getting rid of stuff and not being able to buy more, I’ve come to grips with who I am as a person. I’m very comfortable with myself. I don’t need to buy or own anything that will make me look or will make people think of me a certain way. I live a very good life with what I have. I don’t need more and don’t need the newest or latest of anything and don’t think it will make me feel better. Getting rid of stuff also gives you time back — I don’t spend my weekends cleaning because I can easily organize everything I own. It frees up time to focus on the things you do want to do. I’ve tackled more projects and gotten more writing done and been able to increase my freelancing and quit, because I don’t care about anything else. It’s shown me what’s mattered most to me. What I care about is having good relationships with my family and friends and accomplishing other goals like the writing and being able to quit my job and being able to travel more. Buying things is not important to me. Now it’s gotten to a weird place where I feel not only uncomfortable spending money but I had to go into a mall to buy a baby present in a mall recently, and I felt almost sick in there because I was surrounded by ads. I felt overstimulated from being inside the mall. I don’t like the energy in there. Any other plans for the second year of the ban? I want to focus a lot more on simple and sustainable living, and on being more resourceful in general. I think one thing I’ve noticed is how much we pay for convenience, whether it’s takeout food or buying products vs. just fixing them. Recently, a pair of my workout capris ripped. Previously, I would have thrown them out. Instead I learned how to sew, fixed them, and they are perfectly fine and will probably last another year. I’d like to travel a little less this second year and save more — partially because it’s my first year of freelance. I want to keep that buffer and not blow money. I’ve been thinking about things that might happen way in the future. Vancouver is Canada’s most expensive city — the average price to buy a home now is $1.5 million CAD ($1.2 million USD). I wouldn’t be able to buy the condo I rent for less than $350,000 CAD ($278,000 USD). The thought of spending that amount of money for a little box inside of a big building makes me a little bit sick. I’ve thought about buying some land and putting up a little house on it. Not 100 square feet, but a few hundred square feet. I don’t need a four-bedroom home. But, for the next year, I’ll focus on being more resourceful. Do you have any advice for others? That year after I paid my debt, I was letting my money do things that weren’t actually aligning with my goals. If you’re not getting anywhere with your goals, are there expenses you could cut out that don’t align with your long- or short-term goals? You don’t have to stop drinking coffee because it will save you $500 a year, but is it more important to you to save that $500 for a trip? I think, whenever you make a transaction, your gut instinct tells you everything. You could very easily figure out where you could cut back and create a budget that aligns with your goals. Saying ‘I want to save 20%’ doesn’t mean anything. Why do you want to save money? Make sure your entire budget is wrapped around your goals, not just what you think you should be doing.

Since we introduced a model for a paid Website, the focus of marketing is not so much on reach but on conversion, activation, and engagement. Our job as digital marketers is to bring as many people as possible to the paywall and convert them. But that’s not enough. Once readers take the step of paying for our content, we need to activate them as well. Many new members get a subscription because of a promotion (the iPad that goes with the subscription is quite often more important than the newspaper). Subscribers not only need to have a subscription, they must also use the subscription. The leaked New York Times memo put it this way: “We are putting less effort into reaching reader’s digital doorsteps than we ever did reaching their physical doorsteps.” At De Standaard, we are looking for ways to market and re-market the content to activate the digital reader as much as possible. That’s what we did with Tot aan de Ijzer. This is the first spread of Tot aan de Ijzer, which was debuted in the newspaper on July 28, 2014. That date was exactly 100 years after Austria declared war on Serbia, setting off World War I. This was the start of a series of articles in De Standaard that lasted for more than three months, discussing the German invasion of Belgium. Tot aan de Ijzer – “to the river de Ijzer” — is a detailed historic reconstruction of what happened when German soldiers invaded Belgium in August, took the major Belgian cities one by one, and were halted around Ypres. The series reported on the invasion, military movements, and political impact. De Standaard also published testimonials of civilians, soldiers, priests, nurses, writers, and the like, shedding a light on how the war was survived by the population. Much attention was paid to photography, drawings, cartoons, and infographics — a classic piece of journalism. We used to think our work was done after we put publish. Now we know it only starts after the publication. With the first publication, a promotional campaign drew the reader’s attention to the series. We communicate with in-newspaper ads, by mail, shared pieces on social media to give non-subscribers a taste. We bundled the series well, permitting the reader to easily find the articles. Three months later, a second cycle begins. We re-bundled the content into an ebook and promoted it through another channel. dS Avond is an app with evening news published at 5 p.m. Readers had to download dSA each day and start saving points from the edition. At the end of the week, a full saving card entitled you to an ebook-version of Tot aan de Ijzer (this was the first activation). And at the end of the year, we recycled the ebook and offered it with the print edition as a Christmas gift (voucher with unique download code inserted in the newspaper). By clicking on the box of the day, a coupon appears in the evening edition of dS (dS Avond). Every coupon counts for a downloaded issue of dS Avond. With the second activation, we offered the ebook with the newspaper and had extra newsstand sales of almost 3,000 copies during the weekend. Moreover, these buyers had to register so we collected extra data from an interesting group of non-subscribers. In terms of digital activation, it was a great tool: subscribers activated their digital account to read, and digital readership increased. As the content is the editors’ property, you don’t have any fee or royalty. So this is an extremely cheap way of marketing. A second example of this type of promotion is a photobook called Altijd Ergens — a bundle of pictures of Michiel Hendryckx, a famous Belgian photographer who published his photos in dS Weekblad, our weekend supplement. We also made an ebook of this album and promoted dS Avond by using the same mechanism of saving daily coupons. This was also a big success, but more interesting were the diagrams of both promotions. When you compared the readers of Tot aan de Ijzer with those of Altijd Ergens, we saw that there was only a small percentage of common readers. The target group of downloaders was a different set of people each time. An observation you might like to consider: don’t use the same type of content to promote or activate your brand.

    "DiffbotBody": "It has been a busy week in the fantasy Premier League universe. The PremierLeague.com site has launched for the 2015-16 season with a few new twists. Yahoo has provided some clarity on it's approach to Fantasy Premier League for the upcoming season as well as given a hint about where it is likely to be going in the future. Oh, and there's been a lot of exciting news from the transfer market too. It's a lot to get to so let's get started. PremierLeague.com Launch The granddaddy of them all is back for the 2015-16 season and, along with updated prices and new players entering the league, there are some new featuers that fantasy managers should be aware of. The game launched yesterday so everyone who has been tipped off to that fact has likely seen the three new \"boosts\" that managers will have at their disposal on a one-time basis throughout the season. The two original boosts, the transfer wildcard and the captain, are still around but those in charge of the PL.com game have added three new wrinkles for managers to deploy during the season in an attempt to gain an advantage - All Out Attack, Triple Captain, and Bench Boost. All Out Attack - This boost allows managers to deploy a 2-5-3 line-up in an effort to receive points from more attacking players for the week the boost is deployed. The value of this boost is at least somewhat dubious as the change you're being allowed to make - essentially substituting a forward for a defender compared to a 3-5-2 alignment - isn't clearly an advantage. If you have struck gold with a Harry Kane-like bargains at forward and in midfield with players you were expecting to have on the bench most weeks and want both counting at the expense of a defender then there is a clear value. Otherwise, at least based on last seasons' performances, outside of the top couple of forwards, defenders and forwards yield similar results meaning a 2-5-3 and a 3-5-2 aren't likely to produce markedly different results for most people who use this boost. In fact the greater depth and lower cost of defenders is such that you're probably better off going 3-5-2. Triple Captain - Your designated captain receives double points in a standard week and this boost sees that the captain's total tripled the week it is applied. The obvious time to use this boost is when a player worthy of being your captain - Hazard, Costa, Sanchez, etc. - plays two matches in a game week. Bench Boost - Likely the most valueable of the three new boosts, the Bench Boost gives you points for your entire squad for the week you play it instead of your team only receiving points for the players in the starting line-up. There are two criteria associated with when you are likely to want to use this boost. First, you want to use it at a time when you're feeling pretty good that everyone in your squad is healthy and going to start. Second, you want as many starts as possible over the 15 players in your squad. The schedule doesn't forecast weeks that include multiple matches yet but cup competitions and weather cancellations will inevitably produce a few and the key will be playing the schedule to get as many players as possible in your squad with two matches to get the most from this boost. It may well make sense to use this in conjunction with a wildcard unless you happen to be able to adjust your roster with the standard transfer allocation to get yourself ready for the optimal Bench Boost week. My Early PL.com Line-up After a very brief amount of time poking around through players and prices, here's what I've come up with for my initial squad. Please remember that we have just under a month of transfers and pre-season injuries to go before the Premier League actually kicks off so my actual season-starting line-up may or may not look much like this: GK: Boaz Myhill (4.5) - West Brom start off with Manchester City so I'm unlikely to have Myhill starting but at a price of 4.5 and based on how he performed last season after Ben Foster went down, he's got a place in my squad somewhere. GK: Jack Butland (4.5) - With Asmir Begovic looking unlikely to return, Butland should be a strong bargain in a Stoke City side that should be solid-but-not-spectacular again this season. D: Joleon Lescott (5.0) - A bummer to see his price go up and the early season schedule will likely see Lescott on the bench early but he's another who is highly likely to be a bargain over the course of the sesason. D: Patrick van Aanholt (5.0) - I was hoping he would come in at 4.5 but I'm bullish on his potential, especially if Sunderland improve to be the mid-table team that their budget implies they should be. D: Cedric (5.0) - Everything everyone wrote about Clyne/Bertrand going into last season applies to Cedric this season. He should be a significant bargain and he gets Newcastle to kick off the season. D: Branislav Ivanovic (7.0) - He's probably going to start declining at some point in the next couple of years as a player but we said the same thing about John Terry and look what the return of Mourinho did for his career, Ivanovic should be one of the top producers again this season. D: Hector Bellerin (5.5) - Not nearly the bargain he was over the second half of last season but still solid value assuming he keeps the starting spot over Mathieu Debuchy. M: Eden Hazard (11.5) - No reason to think his results will decline after a summer that saw him get some much needed rest. He's as good a candidate as anyone to be the highest point producer in the game again. M: Theo Walcott (9.0) - With Walcott healthy again and Alexis Sanchez unlikely to start Arsenal's first couple of matches after Copa America duty, it's hard to imagine that Walcott isn't a starter. Arsenal's early-season schedule is pretty light and Walcott seems like the best path to the resulting points. M: Christen Eriksen (8.5) - This would be Cesc Fabregas' spot but Sergio Aguero is unlikely to be ready to start the season after the Copa America which puts Diego Costa in my squad and maxing out my Chelsea contingent. I considered Eriksen, Cazorla, and Silva for this spot and went with Eriksen despite the season-opener at United. He's 1.5 cheaper than Silva and I'm still not sure what's going to happen with Santi Cazorla's playing time with Wilshere, Ramsey, and Oxlade-Chamberlain all healthy. He should start but I have this sneaking concern that, at some point this season, Cazorla becomes a reserve. M: Yannick Bolasie (6.5) - He has looked great under good managers - Pulis and Pardew - and has been overlooked by lesser ones. Pardew seems locked in for the coming season and the thought of Cabaye spraying passes to Bolasie and Puncheon is too much to pass up at 6.5. M: Matt Ritchie (6.0) - I haven't seen him play but the potential for a bargain is there if he can even produce a significant fraction of his Championship statistics from last season (15 goals, 17 assists). F: Diego Costa (11.0) - I explained my logic under the Eriksen note, he started off the season in fantastic form and assuming his hamstrings have returned to something like normal health over the summer he's a no-brainer as your lead forward with Aguero unavailable to start the season. F: Callum Wilson (5.5) - I'm all in trying to replicate the Charlie Austin/Danny Ings magic from last season with bargain forwards and I think Wilson has the best chance to be the guy based on his young age and rapid ascent through the professional ranks. F: Troy Deeney (5.5) - I'm a little less sure on Deeney since he has made it to 25-years-old without someone making a \"Godfather Offer\" to get him to the Premier League before this season. Still, he's not ancient by any stretch of the imagination and taking chances on he and Wilson give me lots of strength elsewhere in my squad. Yahoo Announcement #1 Yahoo yesterday confirmed what we have long suspected. There will not be a Premier League fantasy game from the Silicon Valley-based company for the 2015-16 season. You can read more about it from our old friends at NeverManageAlone.com or see the original Yahoo Help post on the topic here if you don't believe me. There is some reason to believe that the Yahoo season-long Premier League format isn't totally dead (queue Princess Bride quotes about it being only mostly dead here). You can see some of the reason for hope in this Tweet. The other reason for hope comes from Yahoo's second recent fantasy-related announcement. Yahoo Announcement #2 Earlier this week, Yahoo announced the launch of it's own Daily Fantasy Game platform to compete with FanDuel.com and DraftKings.com. They were vague in the video embedded on this page about exactly what would be rolled out and when but Major League Baseball Daily Games are already live. It is a 100% certainty that an NFL game will follow when the NFL season kicks off in September as well. There's just too much popularity associated with the NFL and fantasy for Yahoo to do this and not have NFL ready. The Premier League is a different story, my guess is that, like FanDuel.com, Premier League looks like a good idea for Yahoo but that it will be a secondary priority because the money in PL daily games just doesn't match the league's popularity right now for a variety of reasons that could probably spawn their own feature-length article. Now, I'm not just announcing an uncertain timeline for Yahoo Daily Fantasy for Premier League to put something vague out there, there is a potential positive impact on the Yahoo Season Long game even if it isn't going to come to fruition this season. Yahoo believes that their advantage in entering the Daily Fantasy Game market late is that they can create opportunities for players with teams in free season-long league to enter those season-long teams in Daily Games for money. For Yahoo to realize this advantage in the Premier League market it, of course, means that they'd have to actually have a Season-long Game available to boost trial and repeat usage of the Daily Game. My overall takeaway between these two announcements from Yahoo is that there is hope that we will see some version of Yahoo Season-long Fantasy for the Premier League as soon as the 2016-17 season. Fingers crossed that I'm reading the tea leaves correctly. The Transfer Market - Old Trafford Exits The obvious storyline here is that Manchester United are putting themselves in a very precarious position right now. I don't know that anyone would argue that the ideal scenario for the Red Devils includes selling off spare parts and even making some big moves to replace high profile players who just didn't work out. Falcao has already gone. Robin van Persie seems THISClose to joining him. Nani has been an afterthought for a couple of seasons now and has left for Turkey and Rafael seems likely to join him shortly. Certainly individually, none of those moves would be a concern and even collectively, they're not THAT concerning. The news today has Angel di Maria leaving Old Trafford for Paris Saint-Germain. Oh, and there's the David De Gea drama lurking in the background as well. So, what's the concern? That's a lot of inbound transfer work to be done with the selling clubs holding all the leverage with Manchester United having already sold the players being replaced. There is also the fact that United had some holes to fill already before they started selling. Assuming that di Maria and De Gea do leave as reported then the list for United looks something like this: Goalkeeper Right Back (although Darmian appears very close) Center Back Holding Midfielder Starting Forward Reserve Forward By waiting, United have seen Petr Cech (who, granted, didn't seem to want to leave London) and likely Asmir Begovic removed from the list of potentially available goalkeepers. If Hugo Lloris is serious in saying that he doesn't want to move and Spurs decide they won't be tempted then United's options within the Premier League are almost nil. Outside the Premier League, Ajax would have a ton of leverage to extract a huge transfer fee for Jasper Cillessen if he is the next option on United's list. The same holds true for other positions. Southampton don't seem to be feeling any pressure to sell Morgan Schneiderlin for anything less than what they deem maximum value. Assuming clubs with forwards that could interest United know that there is a big wad of cash sitting around the Old Trafford coffers after an Angel di Maria sale then there's no reason to think that United won't be held to ransom there as well. There is still plenty of time before the window closes at the end of August but United's summer is starting to look more like last summer where they waited to buy. They certainly managed to bring in big names late last summer but given that Luke Shaw was something of an early bust, Falcao is gone, di Maria looks set to follow, Rojo looks like a reserve, and Blind is the Dutch John O'Shea you'd think that they'd try a different approach this summer. Cabaye Arrives What a coup for Crystal Palace! Yohan Cabaye should be very well rested after not playing a lot for PSG for two seasons and he joins a team that needs exactly what he brings. Palace have grit at the back in the form of Scott Dann and Mile Jedinak. They have potent wing play and speed in the attack in the form of Bolasie, Puncheon and Zaha. What they need is a creator to bring it all together which is exactly what Cabaye offers. There is still work to do in the transfer market if the funds are available - a center forward (Charlie Austin has been rumored and would be a perfect foil for Cabaye and all that speed outside), better outside backs, and a younger starting goalkeeper would make for the perfect summer. That said, Palace had a strong second half of last season without any of those things and now they've added Cabaye to the mix. Things are looking up at Selhurst Park. An Underrated Departure Steven N'Zonzi doesn't get a lot of publicity. He plays perhaps the least glamorous position for an unfashionable club. Make no mistake, he is an excellent player and at the root of Stoke City's solidity under Mark Hughes. His departure to Sevilla this week is a massive hole that the Potters need to fill if they are to continue to build on Hughes' success in his first two seasons. I was hoping that Arsenal might pick up N'Zonzi as a partner/deputy for Francis Coquelin as a defensive midfielder but it's hard to deny N'Zonzi a starting spot on a Champions League club for the upcoming season. Smart buy for Sevilla and Hughes will be challenged to find a player of sufficient quality to replace N'Zonzi who wants to move to Stoke. That's a lot to digest for one day, we'll be back with more as the news continues to break.

    "LabBody": "Friday, July 10, 2015. It has been a busy week in the fantasy Premier League universe. The PremierLeague.com site has launched for the 2015-16 season with a few new twists. Yahoo has provided some clarity on it's approach to Fantasy Premier League for the upcoming season as well as given a hint about where it is likely to be going in the future. Oh, and there's been a lot of exciting news from the transfer market too. It's a lot to get to so let's get started. PremierLeague.com Launch. The granddaddy of them all is back for the 2015-16 season and, along with updated prices and new players entering the league, there are some new featuers that fantasy managers should be aware of. The game launched yesterday so everyone who has been tipped off to that fact has likely seen the three new \"boosts\" that managers will have at their disposal on a one-time basis throughout the season. The two original boosts, the transfer wildcard and the captain, are still around but those in charge of the PL.com game have added three new wrinkles for managers to deploy during the season in an attempt to gain an advantage - All Out Attack, Triple Captain, and Bench Boost. All Out Attack - This boost allows managers to deploy a 2-5-3 line-up in an effort to receive points from more attacking players for the week the boost is deployed. The value of this boost is at least somewhat dubious as the change you're being allowed to make - essentially substituting a forward for a defender compared to a 3-5-2 alignment - isn't clearly an advantage. If you have struck gold with a Harry Kane-like bargains at forward and in midfield with players you were expecting to have on the bench most weeks and want both counting at the expense of a defender then there is a clear value. Otherwise, at least based on last seasons' performances, outside of the top couple of forwards, defenders and forwards yield similar results meaning a 2-5-3 and a 3-5-2 aren't likely to produce markedly different results for most people who use this boost. In fact the greater depth and lower cost of defenders is such that you're probably better off going 3-5-2. Triple Captain - Your designated captain receives double points in a standard week and this boost sees that the captain's total tripled the week it is applied. The obvious time to use this boost is when a player worthy of being your captain - Hazard, Costa, Sanchez, etc. - plays two matches in a game week. Bench Boost - Likely the most valueable of the three new boosts, the Bench Boost gives you points for your entire squad for the week you play it instead of your team only receiving points for the players in the starting line-up. There are two criteria associated with when you are likely to want to use this boost. First, you want to use it at a time when you're feeling pretty good that everyone in your squad is healthy and going to start. Second, you want as many starts as possible over the 15 players in your squad. The schedule doesn't forecast weeks that include multiple matches yet but cup competitions and weather cancellations will inevitably produce a few and the key will be playing the schedule to get as many players as possible in your squad with two matches to get the most from this boost. It may well make sense to use this in conjunction with a wildcard unless you happen to be able to adjust your roster with the standard transfer allocation to get yourself ready for the optimal Bench Boost week. My Early PL.com Line-up After a very brief amount of time poking around through players and prices, here's what I've come up with for my initial squad. Please remember that we have just under a month of transfers and pre-season injuries to go before the Premier League actually kicks off so my actual season-starting line-up may or may not look much like this: GK: Boaz Myhill (4.5) - West Brom start off with Manchester City so I'm unlikely to have Myhill starting but at a price of 4.5 and based on how he performed last season after Ben Foster went down, he's got a place in my squad somewhere. GK: Jack Butland (4.5) - With Asmir Begovic looking unlikely to return, Butland should be a strong bargain in a Stoke City side that should be solid-but-not-spectacular again this season. D: Joleon Lescott (5.0) - A bummer to see his price go up and the early season schedule will likely see Lescott on the bench early but he's another who is highly likely to be a bargain over the course of the sesason. D: Patrick van Aanholt (5.0) - I was hoping he would come in at 4.5 but I'm bullish on his potential, especially if Sunderland improve to be the mid-table team that their budget implies they should be. D: Cedric (5.0) - Everything everyone wrote about Clyne/Bertrand going into last season applies to Cedric this season. He should be a significant bargain and he gets Newcastle to kick off the season. D: Branislav Ivanovic (7.0) - He's probably going to start declining at some point in the next couple of years as a player but we said the same thing about John Terry and look what the return of Mourinho did for his career, Ivanovic should be one of the top producers again this season. D: Hector Bellerin (5.5) - Not nearly the bargain he was over the second half of last season but still solid value assuming he keeps the starting spot over Mathieu Debuchy. M: Eden Hazard (11.5) - No reason to think his results will decline after a summer that saw him get some much needed rest. He's as good a candidate as anyone to be the highest point producer in the game again. M: Theo Walcott (9.0) - With Walcott healthy again and Alexis Sanchez unlikely to start Arsenal's first couple of matches after Copa America duty, it's hard to imagine that Walcott isn't a starter. Arsenal's early-season schedule is pretty light and Walcott seems like the best path to the resulting points. M: Christen Eriksen (8.5) - This would be Cesc Fabregas' spot but Sergio Aguero is unlikely to be ready to start the season after the Copa America which puts Diego Costa in my squad and maxing out my Chelsea contingent. I considered Eriksen, Cazorla, and Silva for this spot and went with Eriksen despite the season-opener at United. He's 1.5 cheaper than Silva and I'm still not sure what's going to happen with Santi Cazorla's playing time with Wilshere, Ramsey, and Oxlade-Chamberlain all healthy. He should start but I have this sneaking concern that, at some point this season, Cazorla becomes a reserve. M: Yannick Bolasie (6.5) - He has looked great under good managers - Pulis and Pardew - and has been overlooked by lesser ones. Pardew seems locked in for the coming season and the thought of Cabaye spraying passes to Bolasie and Puncheon is too much to pass up at 6.5. M: Matt Ritchie (6.0) - I haven't seen him play but the potential for a bargain is there if he can even produce a significant fraction of his Championship statistics from last season (15 goals, 17 assists). F: Diego Costa (11.0) - I explained my logic under the Eriksen note, he started off the season in fantastic form and assuming his hamstrings have returned to something like normal health over the summer he's a no-brainer as your lead forward with Aguero unavailable to start the season. F: Callum Wilson (5.5) - I'm all in trying to replicate the Charlie Austin/Danny Ings magic from last season with bargain forwards and I think Wilson has the best chance to be the guy based on his young age and rapid ascent through the professional ranks. F: Troy Deeney (5.5) - I'm a little less sure on Deeney since he has made it to 25-years-old without someone making a \"Godfather Offer\" to get him to the Premier League before this season. Still, he's not ancient by any stretch of the imagination and taking chances on he and Wilson give me lots of strength elsewhere in my squad. Yahoo Announcement #1. Yahoo yesterday confirmed what we have long suspected. There will not be a Premier League fantasy game from the Silicon Valley-based company for the 2015-16 season. You can read more about it from our old friends at NeverManageAlone.com or see the original Yahoo Help post on the topic here if you don't believe me. There is some reason to believe that the Yahoo season-long Premier League format isn't totally dead (queue Princess Bride quotes about it being only mostly dead here). You can see some of the reason for hope in this Tweet. The other reason for hope comes from Yahoo's second recent fantasy-related announcement. Yahoo Announcement #2. Earlier this week, Yahoo announced the launch of it's own Daily Fantasy Game platform to compete with FanDuel.com and DraftKings.com. They were vague in the video embedded on this page about exactly what would be rolled out and when but Major League Baseball Daily Games are already live. It is a 100% certainty that an NFL game will follow when the NFL season kicks off in September as well. There's just too much popularity associated with the NFL and fantasy for Yahoo to do this and not have NFL ready. The Premier League is a different story, my guess is that, like FanDuel.com, Premier League looks like a good idea for Yahoo but that it will be a secondary priority because the money in PL daily games just doesn't match the league's popularity right now for a variety of reasons that could probably spawn their own feature-length article. Now, I'm not just announcing an uncertain timeline for Yahoo Daily Fantasy for Premier League to put something vague out there, there is a potential positive impact on the Yahoo Season Long game even if it isn't going to come to fruition this season. Yahoo believes that their advantage in entering the Daily Fantasy Game market late is that they can create opportunities for players with teams in free season-long league to enter those season-long teams in Daily Games for money. For Yahoo to realize this advantage in the Premier League market it, of course, means that they'd have to actually have a Season-long Game available to boost trial and repeat usage of the Daily Game. My overall takeaway between these two announcements from Yahoo is that there is hope that we will see some version of Yahoo Season-long Fantasy for the Premier League as soon as the 2016-17 season. Fingers crossed that I'm reading the tea leaves correctly. The Transfer Market - Old Trafford Exits. The obvious storyline here is that Manchester United are putting themselves in a very precarious position right now. I don't know that anyone would argue that the ideal scenario for the Red Devils includes selling off spare parts and even making some big moves to replace high profile players who just didn't work out.

The treatments may take a bit of effort, but you'll save money and avoid time-consuming and possibly painful visits to the dermatologist. Lifestyle Changes MayoClinic.com states that smoking can create deep wrinkles around your mouth and speed up your skin's natural aging process. Stop smoking to prevent deep wrinkles from forming or getting worse. Sun exposure can also lead to wrinkles around your mouth. If you go out in the sun, apply sunblock to your face to prevent the sun's ultraviolet rays from worsening your wrinkles or creating new wrinkles around your mouth.",
    "LabBody": "Exercises. One of the most affordable ways to get rid of deep wrinkles around your mouth is to perform face-tightening exercises. The Genius Beauty website recommends standing in front of the mirror and performing facial exercises for 15 minutes every day to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Start by stretching your mouth as wide as you can, as if saying \"cheese.\" Hold the position for two seconds, then pucker your lips together tightly so that your lips almost touch your nose. Hold this pose for two seconds, then stretch your mouth back into the \"cheese\" position. After two seconds, stretch your lips forward and down, as if saying the word \"go.\" Hold for two seconds, then relax. Repeat the entire routine 20 times.",

PM @narendramodi meets PM Nawaz Sharif on sidelines of SCO Summit,\" tweeted ministry of external affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup.Modi and Sharif met informally and exchanged pleasantries on Thursday night at a dinner hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the BRICS-SCO summit delegates.India and Pakistan are set to be absorbed as full-fledged members of the China-led SCO on Friday.All issues, including terrorism and trade, are expected to be on the table during the around 30-minute talks.The constant firing on the border is likely to feature in the talks, especially as a BSF trooper was killed in cross-border firing.The release of 26/11 mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi is to be taken up too. India is expected to voice its concerns over Lakhvi's release by a Pakistani court.Ways of boosting cross-border trade are also likely to figure. Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Qazi Khalilullah had said in Islamabad on Thursday that the meeting between the two prime ministers is \"expected to have a positive impact on bilateral relations and regional and international levels\". Modi and Sharif met in November last year during the SAARC Summit in Kathmandu, but they did not hold any bilateral meeting.The two leaders had held a bilateral meeting on May 26 last year during the swearing-in of Modi.The meeting comes as both countries are set to be absorbed as permanent members into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation grouping.The US has welcomed the meeting between Modi and Sharif, saying the tension between the two South Asian neighbours is not in anyone's interest.\"We welcome the meeting between Indian and Pakistani leaders on the sidelines of this conference,\" State Department Spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday.\"We also welcome any steps that both countries can take to try to reduce the tensions. That's been our longstanding position,\" Kirby said.\"We want to see the tensions reduced, and we want to see these issues resolved bilaterally between the two countries. It's in nobody's interest for the tensions to rise and to increase, and for the tensions in the region to become less stable in many ways than they already are,\" he added.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Adding meal or snack entries was a cinch, with more than 5 million listed food items from the crowdsourced global database. Oddly there's no auto conversion from ounces to grams for entries from the US, but there's usually enough in metric measure to get by. Even a particularly uncommon restaurant creation will have some near-enough substitute entry, though I'm sure Anna Polyviou would weep knowing I reduced a slice of her award-winning, 35-step, MasterChef-featured carrot cake masterpiece to \"Carrot cake – Walmart Bakery\". Accomplishments celebrated Like activity tracker apps, MyFitnessPal acts like a tiny personal trainer by regularly celebrating healthy bites and nudging when you trip up. Each night, a simple MyFitnessPal screen informs you: \"If every day was like today ... you'd weigh xx kg in five weeks.\" which is hard to ignore. For individual food entries, a little coloured bubble rewarded my steak with \"This food is high in protein!\", while a \"Double whopper, no cheese, 3766 kJ\" got me \"Your fat goal for today is 72 grams, and this has 56 grams\". The bubbles don't always pop up, and MyFitnessPal's general philosophy seems to be that over nagging can be counterproductive, especially for those already a little sensitive. The developers must be either great managers or parents. If you're after a stricter digital dietitian, Jawbone's Up app is arguably the most vocal and judgmental, ruthlessly scoring each of your meals out of 10 for nutritional value. You don't need an actual Jawbone device and even better, it syncs with MyFitnessPal and its much bigger food database. Such handy app partnerships are bountiful with MyFitnessPal, including for activity trackers. Exercise makes a difference to weight control and in MyFitnessPal earns you more calories to \"spend\" that day. While you can quickly enter workouts manually, Fitbit steps automatically flowed through to give me more reliable kilojoule kudos, as did Endomondo and Strava bike rides, and even Pilates workouts with the Wahoo Fitness app and heart rate chest strap (using Apple's native Health app as a \"bridge\"). A 300 metre test walk in Strava didn't sync. MyFitnessPal might be too tactful to say why, but I bet it was because it was such a wimpy workout. While weight fluctuates daily, punching it in every morning updates both a numerical and graphical running total of kilos lost, which was surprisingly exciting. After I actually hit my first four-kilogram weight-loss target, I started another five-week session and hit that too, as I did the shops a few weeks later to get better fitting clothes. As they say in the ads, your results may vary, especially if you're not motivated by numbers. Weight isn't everything when it comes to staying in shape, but for many of us who love the foodie life, calorie consumption is the elephant in the room and MyFitnessPal is an impressive tamer.",

The MyFitnessPal calorie counter app uses a mix of friendly nagging and hard targets to fix problems activity trackers can't, writes Ky Chow. Many of us have a general idea that our toil at the gym burns a depressingly low amount of calories, but without those facts constantly in our face and delicious food to be had, we rely on boot camps and spin sessions to shed our excess kilos and inches. The MyFitnessPal app (iOS, Android, Windows and a very slow Blackberry version) is a well thought out, enormously popular calorie counter that blows this fantasy away with brutally specific numbers throughout your day. Without changing my exercise regime, I dropped eight kilos after just a few months. Simple to use. It's simple to set up: enter your current and target weights, and how quickly you want to get there. The app then gives you a daily calorie (or kilojoule) limit that it expects will make you hit that target weight. The accountability of constant hard numbers on my mobile device changed my eating habits surprisingly quickly, and it probably suits competitive corporate types. To stay below my 6700kJ daily limit, I found myself bypassing my once-automatic mid-afternoon \"Time Out (Cadbury), 32g, 732kJ\". If I enjoyed \"Eggs Benedict with Ham – Coffee Club, 3908 kJ\" for Saturday brunch, I'd pass on entrees at dinner (well, most of the time). Adding meal or snack entries was a cinch, with more than 5 million listed food items from the crowdsourced global database. Oddly there's no auto conversion from ounces to grams for entries from the US, but there's usually enough in metric measure to get by. Even a particularly uncommon restaurant creation will have some near-enough substitute entry, though I'm sure Anna Polyviou would weep knowing I reduced a slice of her award-winning, 35-step, MasterChef-featured carrot cake masterpiece to \"Carrot cake – Walmart Bakery\". Accomplishments celebrated. Like activity tracker apps, MyFitnessPal acts like a tiny personal trainer by regularly celebrating healthy bites and nudging when you trip up. Each night, a simple MyFitnessPal screen informs you: \"If every day was like today ... you'd weigh xx kg in five weeks.\" which is hard to ignore. For individual food entries, a little coloured bubble rewarded my steak with \"This food is high in protein!\", while a \"Double whopper, no cheese, 3766 kJ\" got me \"Your fat goal for today is 72 grams, and this has 56 grams\". The bubbles don't always pop up, and MyFitnessPal's general philosophy seems to be that over nagging can be counterproductive, especially for those already a little sensitive. The developers must be either great managers or parents. If you're after a stricter digital dietitian, Jawbone's Up app is arguably the most vocal and judgmental, ruthlessly scoring each of your meals out of 10 for nutritional value. You don't need an actual Jawbone device and even better, it syncs with MyFitnessPal and its much bigger food database. Such handy app partnerships are bountiful with MyFitnessPal, including for activity trackers. Exercise makes a difference to weight control and in MyFitnessPal earns you more calories to \"spend\" that day. While you can quickly enter workouts manually, Fitbit steps automatically flowed through to give me more reliable kilojoule kudos, as did Endomondo and Strava bike rides, and even Pilates workouts with the Wahoo Fitness app and heart rate chest strap (using Apple's native Health app as a \"bridge\"). A 300 metre test walk in Strava didn't sync. MyFitnessPal might be too tactful to say why, but I bet it was because it was such a wimpy workout. While weight fluctuates daily, punching it in every morning updates both a numerical and graphical running total of kilos lost, which was surprisingly exciting. After I actually hit my first four-kilogram weight-loss target, I started another five-week session and hit that too, as I did the shops a few weeks later to get better fitting clothes. As they say in the ads, your results may vary, especially if you're not motivated by numbers. Weight isn't everything when it comes to staying in shape, but for many of us who love the foodie life, calorie consumption is the elephant in the room and MyFitnessPal is an impressive tamer.",

    "DiffbotBody": "She may be a member of one of the country's most powerful families, but even Ivanka Trump's three-year-old daughter Arabella is powerless when it comes to the weather - even when she performs an adorable song and dance in the hopes of ensuring some sunshine. 33-year-old Ivanka shared a precious video of Arabella, dressed in a Snow White costume while standing on a children's table singing about the weather. As she waves her arms back and forth, she can be heard belting out: 'Oh Mr. Sun. Sun. Mr. Golden Sun. Please shine down on me,' while her one-year-old brother Joseph sings along in the background. 'Arabella, hoping for sunshine the best way she knows how - hamming it up for the camera,' Ivanka captioned the video, which she posted to her Instagram account on Thursday. Nearly 5,000 people have liked the video since it was posted, with many people praising Ivanka for being such a hands-on mother. 'Love when you share photos and videos of your kids! Business woman, mom and wife! Keep it up! #inspiration,' one commenter wrote, while another added: 'You are genuinely the epitome of a WORKING MOM. 'You are truly an inspiration to those of us, esp. In NYC who strive for that Balance. Kudos to YOU! [sic].' Meanwhile, others noted that Arabella, whose mom often snaps pictures of her playing dress up, has developed a particular penchant for emulating Disney princesses. 'I feel like Arabella lives in that dress,' one person noted of the little girls Snow White costume, while another added: 'She's always wearing a Disney gown lol. Cute [sic].' And while the weather in New York City has had its fair share of rain this summer, Arabella did manage to get a pool day in last week. Ivanka snapped a sweet picture of her daughter in a floral one piece and purple sunglasses as she lounged in shallow water, writing, '#poolparty' on the Instagram caption. The former model and her mini-me have been having a great summer so far. Arabella is a budding ballerina, and for their latest girls' night out last week the mother-of-two treated her eldest child to a night at the ballet. The mother-of-two, who took her daughter to see American Ballet Theatre's production of Cinderella at Lincoln Center in New York City, shared an adorable video of Arabella playing by the plaza's fountain before the show. In the clip, which was posted to Ivanka's Instagram account that night, a surprised Arabella can be seen gleefully running back and fourth every time the fountain's water shoots in the air. Ivanka's stylish eldest child looked right at home at the ballet, wearing a pale pink dress featuring white rosettes at the hem. Always one to accessorize, Arabella topped her look with glittery flats, a matching purse worn across her chest, and a bow in her hair, which was pulled back into a low ponytail. 'Night at the Ballet! #lincolncenter,' Ivanka captioned the video, which shared with her 553,000 Instagram followers. More than 10,000 people have liked the video, with many commenting on Arabella's picture perfect ensemble. 'Love that Arabella has her little crossbody happening. #alwaysaccessorize,' one wrote, while another added: 'She's such a beautiful young lady. Love the outfit.' The next morning, Ivanka also posted a photo of Arabella posing angelically by the fountain, writing: 'Last night at the ballet...' Ivanka's daughter and her son Joseph frequently star on her mother's social media accounts as the Celebrity Apprentice star often shares photos of her adventures with her children and husband Jared Kushner. Earlier this month, Ivanka helped Arabella set up her first lemonade stand, with the profits from the sale going to 'the hungry children of New York'. 'The sun is out and our lemonade stand is ready! #open4business,' she captioned the snapshot of the pink stand decorated with yellow balloons. Many commenters praised Ivanka for instilling a strong work ethic in Arabella at such a young age. 'Business 101 from young age. That's how you raise children to be successful. Well done Ivanka.' one person wrote, while another added: 'Now that's one awesome lemonade stand! I'd buy some!' But before Ivanka and her children opened their lemonade stand, it was a rainy Sunday, and the blond beauty snapped a precious picture of Arabella kissing her bunny lamp while her brother watched her every move. 'Baking brownies, playing Candy Land and kissing bunnies on this rainy Sunday morning!' Ivanka wrote. And the brownies that they made ended up being sold at their lemonade stand later in the day. Ivanka, who introduced her father Donald before he announced his presidential bid last month, is the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization. The proud mom has also recently shared photos of her husband enjoying Father's Day with their two children, as well as her son Joseph's visit to her office.

Although the four photos released includes a formal family portrait, the other three pictures feature the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in more relaxed, casual poses. In each one, they smile broadly, proudly showing off their young children. Celebrity photographer Mario Testino, a favorite of Charlotte's grandmother, Princess Diana, took the photos on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk, just outside of London. Testino also was the photographer who took the official engagement photos for Prince William and Duchess Kate. In the more formal portrait, Princess Charlotte sits on the lap of her mother, who sits on a parlor couch with her husband and her nearly 2-year-old son, Prince George, to her right. Queen Elizabeth sits to her left. Behind them are the members of the Middleton family — Duchess Kate's sister, brother and parents — and Prince William's family, his father Prince Charles with his wife, Duchess Camilla, and William's grandfather, Prince Phillip. The only significant omission is Prince Harry, who is currently working abroad in Africa. Kensington Palace released the photos through social media, initially sharing them on Twitter and Instagram as a way to thank the well wishes William and Kate have received over their newly-expanded family. Princess Charlotte was christened July 5 in a private ceremony at St. Mary Magdalene, the same countryside church where Princess Diana was baptized. \"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their whole family had a wonderful day on Sunday and were delighted to share the special occasion with the thousands of people who came to Sandringham,\" Kensington Palace said in a press release about the photos. \"They are very happy to share these photographs and hope that everyone enjoys them as much as they do.\"",

He's still working hard at 72, but someday he'll necessarily surrender his flesh, and we'll no longer have his fascinating films to experience every few years. The Yerba Buena Center for the Arts' Hardcore Cronenberg festival presents 10 of his films over 10 weeks (each with two screenings), some of which have not been served well on video and are being presented on rare 35mm prints. Not on 35mm but still vital is his first feature, the 1975 gorefest Shivers, a J.G. Ballard-esque tale of a high rise infested by a sexually transmitted parasite. Unmissable movies presented on film-film include Cronenberg's undeniable 1983 masterpiece Videodrome, in which television is reality and reality is less than television; his obvious 1986 masterpiece The Fly, still the gold standard for how to do a remake right; and his inarguable 1996 masterpiece Crash, a direct Ballard adaptation about automotive fetishists. And be sure to give lube up your game port for eXistenZ, which in a just world would be remembered as 1999's defining film about humanity's relationship with games and virtual reality, and without any eXistenZ Reloaded or eXistenZ Revolutions to muck things up. It›s also his sexiest film this side of Videodrome and even Crash — and that's pretty hardcore.",

A tough algebra lesson can result in an emotional outburst that causes the teacher to remove a teenager from the classroom. To give troubled children extra support as they work toward high school diplomas, the Florida United Methodist Children’s Home and Volusia County school district will partner starting this fall by providing classes for about 30 students on the nonprofit organization’s property. \"Our children, in many cases, have endured significant trauma, and as a result, it makes it difficult for them to learn in a traditional learning environment,\" said Elisabeth Gadd, the vice president of development for Florida United Methodist Children's Home. The Legacy Scholars Academy will serve students in kindergarten through 12th grade who live at the Enterprise residential facility. The Volusia school district will provide teachers for the school, and capture the state's dollars allocated to those students, according to a one-year contract recently approved by the School Board. Gadd said hosting classes in their own facilities will allow them to keep children with behavior problems on track academically. Some of their residents are missing too much class in traditional public schools because of behavior issues. The district expects to spend $450,000 annually to operate the program, and the state dollars allocated for those students will cover the cost. The children will be enrolled as exceptional students, so the district will receive more money per student than are allotted for general education students. The district will provide four teachers and four aides. This type of arrangement is not unique in Volusia: The district has a similar arrangement with Halifax Health Behavioral Services. The Florida United Methodist Children’s Home serves children who can’t live with their families due to wide-ranging circumstances including abuse, abandonment or the illness or death of a parent. Children often are referred to the home through clergy, schools or courts. Becky Dotson, the organization’s president and CEO, described them as “some of the most vulnerable children in the state of Florida,” during a recent board meeting. Most of the facility’s’ more than 100 residents will continue to attend traditional public schools. Only students with severe behavior problems will be kept on site, Gadd said. The school will provide traditional academics as well as social and emotional skills, but can’t provide religious instruction. It’s not the first time students will be able to attend classes at the residential home. The organization provided an on-site school for residents in middle and high school during the past school year at the organization’s expense, but the agreement with the school district will allow the school to receive public school dollars. Providing a school on site allows children “with huge potential,” Dotson said, to receive high school diplomas. “Their grades were not that bad — their academics were not that bad,” she said. “Their behaviors were causing them not to be successful in the school system.” Retired teacher Linda Cuthbert remembers balancing the needs of a roomful of children, including a few from the children's home. Now a board member, she said she thinks the partnership is a fitting way to meet the needs of students who have endured unusually stressful childhoods. \"They do need a little more reassurance of being loved, having a sense of belonging and having a home,\" Cuthbert said. Instead of suspending students who have outbursts, the center can direct them to a time-out area until they calm down. Children can often return to class within minutes, instead of missing a full day, Gadd said. In addition to academics, students at the Legacy Scholars Academy will learn to cope with their emotions in productive ways. Counselors and therapists will be on hand. \"It's a win-win in terms of both parties,\" Gadd said. \"We’re able to serve the students that have greatest needs and take the pressure off of the public school system.\" All rights reserved.

    "DiffbotBody": "Nobody seems all that upset about end-of-life counseling anymore. For all the talk of \"death panels\" six years ago, the news that Medicare intended to start paying doctors for counseling their patients on end-of-life care mustered little more than a whimper. In 2009, end-of-life counseling's presence in early drafts of the health care reform law led to fear-mongering (and a PolitiFact Lie of the Year award) about \"death panels.\" Now, it appears that rhetoric has gone quietly into the night. Some Republicans actually praised the Obama administration's decision announced Wednesday, saying that it should help Americans navigate a difficult time in their lives. And even opponents of the policy acknowledged that there might not be much that they could do to stop it. \"I like that. I do,\" said Tennessee Rep. Phil Roe, a stalwart conservative and cochair of the GOP Doctors Caucus, in an interview. Roe is a long-time supporter of end-of-life counseling and has cosponsored legislation in the past with Oregon Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer to have Medicare pay for it. He wasn't alone. \"This particular issue was one of the few things within the health care law that I thought was a good provision,\" said Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, another Republican doctor who is running for his state's open Senate seat next year. \"If you have somebody who's going to hospice or has a terminal illness, and a physician going to counsel them on their end-of-life issues ... the individual should be compensated or reimbursed, just like any other consultative service.\" \"It's something that is both professional and personal to me. I've had to do that myself and my own family,\" said Roe, whose wife died of cancer four months ago. \"It's something that nobody likes to talk about. This is not the fun part of medicine. \"But it's something everybody's going to do,\" he continued. \"It's something you should sit down and discuss with your doctor and your family, and this is just a way to reimburse the doctor a little bit for their time because otherwise we just took the time to do it.\" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule, which will be open to public comment for 60 days, to have Medicare reimburse doctors for conducting end-of-life counseling with their patients. (The New York Times reported that 80 percent of Americans who die every year are covered by the government insurance program). Doctors would be paid for 30-minute face-to-face sessions starting in January under the proposal. The exact payment amounts will be set after the public-comment period. \"Establishing separate payment for advance care planning codes provides beneficiaries and practitioners greater opportunity and flexibility to utilize these planning sessions at the most appropriate time for patients and their families,\" the agency said. Not everybody in Congress shares the administration's or Roe's outlook, however. Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, who cochairs the GOP Doctors Caucus with Roe, said the proposed Medicare rule was another example of \"wasteful Washington spending\" that could be prone to fraud. He gave the example of a patient coming in for a blood-pressure check but having it billed as an end-of-life counseling session. \"Since when does the government have to micromanage people to do what is best for them in their lives?\" said Fleming, who did say he supports doctors and patients talking about end-of-life care and doesn't mind public-awareness campaigns encouraging them to do so. Great news in short form along with much needed humor.\" Patrick, President of private healthcare consulting firm Informative and help[s] me stay on track. \" Director of Scientific Affairs, Non-profit medicial society However, he said, \"to prescribe into the law that we should pay specially just for that discussion I think is just again another example of wasteful Washington spending.\" But whether opponents are going to make much effort to publicly decry or stop the CMS rule is unclear. The National Right to Life Committee, which opposes the policy and said \"its pervasive focus is to 'nudge' patients to agree to forego life-saving treatment and even assisted feeding through the use of unbalanced, distorted, and even inaccurate information,\" said it was working with lawmakers on alternative proposals but declined to name names. Fleming seemed skeptical that they had many options to stop the administration's plan. \"If it's something that the president can do without a vote, there's not much we can say or do,\" he said. \"I wouldn't foresee there being a lot of controversy over it,\" Heck said, noting that, for many Obamacare opponents, a Medicare advisory board that was created by the law has since taken on the moniker of \"death panel\" or \"rationing board.\" The House voted to repeal the board last month. Roe does expect some charged rhetoric after the rule's release, but he also said when he has talked with other Republicans about why he supports the policy, they start to look at it differently. \"The reason I stepped up is I know what happened in 2009, and it's easy to demagogue,\" Roe said. \"When you get an issue that's easy to demagogue, you need to somebody that's actually been boots on the ground, that's actually dealt with this at 3 o'clock in the morning.\" \"You have to lower the temperature in the room,\" he said. \"Once you sat down and explain to them what it was, so that it wasn't demagogued, people were receptive to that because they understand that one of these days, everybody's going to have to make that decision.\"",
    "LabBody": "July 9, 2015 For all the talk of “death pan­els” six years ago, the news that Medi­care in­ten­ded to start pay­ing doc­tors for coun­sel­ing their pa­tients on end-of-life care mustered little more than a whim­per. In 2009, end-of-life coun­sel­ing’s pres­ence in early drafts of the health care re­form law led to fear-mon­ger­ing (and a Poli­ti­Fact Lie of the Year award) about “death pan­els.” Now, it ap­pears that rhet­or­ic has gone quietly in­to the night. Some Re­pub­lic­ans ac­tu­ally praised the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s de­cision an­nounced Wed­nes­day, say­ing that it should help Amer­ic­ans nav­ig­ate a dif­fi­cult time in their lives. And even op­pon­ents of the policy ac­know­ledged that there might not be much that they could do to stop it. “I like that. I do,” said Ten­ness­ee Rep. Phil Roe, a stal­wart con­ser­vat­ive and co­chair of the GOP Doc­tors Caucus, in an in­ter­view. Roe is a long-time sup­port­er of end-of-life coun­sel­ing and has co­sponsored le­gis­la­tion in the past with Ore­gon Demo­crat­ic Rep. Earl Blumenauer to have Medi­care pay for it. He wasn’t alone. “This par­tic­u­lar is­sue was one of the few things with­in the health care law that I thought was a good pro­vi­sion,” said Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, an­oth­er Re­pub­lic­an doc­tor who is run­ning for his state’s open Sen­ate seat next year. “If you have some­body who’s go­ing to hos­pice or has a ter­min­al ill­ness, and a phys­i­cian go­ing to coun­sel them on their end-of-life is­sues … the in­di­vidu­al should be com­pensated or re­im­bursed, just like any oth­er con­sultat­ive ser­vice.” “It’s something that is both pro­fes­sion­al and per­son­al to me. I’ve had to do that my­self and my own fam­ily,” said Roe, whose wife died of can­cer four months ago. “It’s something that nobody likes to talk about. This is not the fun part of medi­cine. “But it’s something every­body’s go­ing to do,” he con­tin­ued. “It’s something you should sit down and dis­cuss with your doc­tor and your fam­ily, and this is just a way to re­im­burse the doc­tor a little bit for their time be­cause oth­er­wise we just took the time to do it.” The Cen­ters for Medi­care and Medi­caid Ser­vices pro­posed a rule, which will be open to pub­lic com­ment for 60 days, to have Medi­care re­im­burse doc­tors for con­duct­ing end-of-life coun­sel­ing with their pa­tients. (The New York Times re­por­ted that 80 per­cent of Amer­ic­ans who die every year are covered by the gov­ern­ment in­sur­ance pro­gram). Doc­tors would be paid for 30-minute face-to-face ses­sions start­ing in Janu­ary un­der the pro­pos­al. The ex­act pay­ment amounts will be set after the pub­lic-com­ment peri­od. “Es­tab­lish­ing sep­ar­ate pay­ment for ad­vance care plan­ning codes provides be­ne­fi­ciar­ies and prac­ti­tion­ers great­er op­por­tun­ity and flex­ib­il­ity to util­ize these plan­ning ses­sions at the most ap­pro­pri­ate time for pa­tients and their fam­il­ies,” the agency said. Not every­body in Con­gress shares the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s or Roe’s out­look, however. Louisi­ana Rep. John Flem­ing, who co­chairs the GOP Doc­tors Caucus with Roe, said the pro­posed Medi­care rule was an­oth­er ex­ample of “waste­ful Wash­ing­ton spend­ing” that could be prone to fraud. He gave the ex­ample of a pa­tient com­ing in for a blood-pres­sure check but hav­ing it billed as an end-of-life coun­sel­ing ses­sion. “Since when does the gov­ern­ment have to mi­cro­man­age people to do what is best for them in their lives?” said Flem­ing, who did say he sup­ports doc­tors and pa­tients talk­ing about end-of-life care and doesn’t mind pub­lic-aware­ness cam­paigns en­cour­aging them to do so. However, he said, “to pre­scribe in­to the law that we should pay spe­cially just for that dis­cus­sion I think is just again an­oth­er ex­ample of waste­ful Wash­ing­ton spend­ing.” But wheth­er op­pon­ents are go­ing to make much ef­fort to pub­licly de­cry or stop the CMS rule is un­clear. The Na­tion­al Right to Life Com­mit­tee, which op­poses the policy and said “its per­vas­ive fo­cus is to ‘nudge’ pa­tients to agree to fore­go life-sav­ing treat­ment and even as­sisted feed­ing through the use of un­bal­anced, dis­tor­ted, and even in­ac­cur­ate in­form­a­tion,” said it was work­ing with law­makers on al­tern­at­ive pro­pos­als but de­clined to name names. Flem­ing seemed skep­tic­al that they had many op­tions to stop the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s plan. “If it’s something that the pres­id­ent can do without a vote, there’s not much we can say or do,” he said. “I wouldn’t fore­see there be­ing a lot of con­tro­versy over it,” Heck said, not­ing that, for many Obama­care op­pon­ents, a Medi­care ad­vis­ory board that was cre­ated by the law has since taken on the monik­er of “death pan­el” or “ra­tion­ing board.” The House voted to re­peal the board last month. Roe does ex­pect some charged rhet­or­ic after the rule’s re­lease, but he also said when he has talked with oth­er Re­pub­lic­ans about why he sup­ports the policy, they start to look at it dif­fer­ently. “The reas­on I stepped up is I know what happened in 2009, and it’s easy to dem­agogue,” Roe said. “When you get an is­sue that’s easy to dem­agogue, you need to some­body that’s ac­tu­ally been boots on the ground, that’s ac­tu­ally dealt with this at 3 o’clock in the morn­ing.” “You have to lower the tem­per­at­ure in the room,” he said. “Once you sat down and ex­plain to them what it was, so that it wasn’t dem­agogued, people were re­cept­ive to that be­cause they un­der­stand that one of these days, every­body’s go­ing to have to make that de­cision.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "About 15 to 20 residents crowded New Market’s town hall Thursday night to comment and question representatives about the planned development for the 262-acre property, which was annexed into the town in 2014. Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Google has released an Ethernet adapter to solve the issue of the Chromecast having connection issues. While the adapter will add to the wires behind the TV, it should ensure that as data transfers get more intense with things like gaming, the Chromecast is able to handle it. (Photo : Google) The Google Chromecast has been hailed as one of the easiest and most affordable ways to stream video content from mobile devices and computers to a TV, however, many users do experience one particular issue with it — dropped connections. Thankfully, for those who experience dropped connections often, Google has introduced a new Ethernet adapter for Chromecast that costs only $15. The Chromecast itself connects to 2.4 Ghz wireless networks, which are often crowded, meaning that finding a completely clear signal is very difficult. This can often cause significant interruptions to video using the Chromecast. While being able to connect to 5 Ghz networks would help the issue a lot, so far, Chromecasts cannot connect to them. This adapter, however, should be a good fix to those issues, at least in the meantime. The adapter is simply a power brick that plugs into the Chromecast, offering both power and data transfer at the same time. Then, the user simply needs to plug an Ethernet cable into the adapter from the Internet router, and users should have great quality, uninterrupted video streaming. The adapter supports data transfers of up to 100 Mbps, which should be more than enough for video streaming. Of course, it's likely that the next Chromecast will support 5 Ghz wireless networks, which should solve the issue for most users, however, for those who want to be extra sure or don't want to buy a new Chromecast when it finally comes out, the new adapter is a great option. It will be especially useful for individuals who have their wireless router near the TV, eliminating the need to run an Ethernet cable across the room. Users will be pleased to see the focus that Google has kept on the Chromecast. Only a few weeks ago, the company announced that Chromecast would support Google Slides, allowing users to easily cast their presentations from their smartphone. The company is also reportedly going to use Chromecast as more of a gaming device as time goes, on allowing users to stream games from their smartphones to their TV and use their phones as controllers for the games. Of course, this will require a good connection between devices, making it even more important that the Chromecast doesn't drop its connection to the Internet. Chromecast isn't the only streaming device that Google offers, with the company also offering a more fully-featured device called the Nexus Player. The Nexus Player has not been anywhere near as successful as the Chromecast, however, largely because of the price, with the Nexus Player coming in at $79, compared with the Chromecast's $35.

A simple concept (striped Madewell et Sézane tee, denim skirt, structured bag) gets taken to the next level with cool-girl touches like funky sunglasses and unexpected navy mules. Like many body-baring ensembles worn by J.Lo, we advise you to proceed with caution. But we can't help thinking that her cropped A.L.C. top, flirty ruffled Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent Exclusive for Intermix skirt and Barbara Bonner fringe bag are begging to be worn out at night somewhere tropical (or faux tropical – a tiki bar would do). A busy black-and-white print like the one on Lea's Zimmermann dress seems to call for a coordinating black or white pump. But how much more attention-getting is the look with a pair of strappy, multihued Jimmy Choo sandals? Wonder why we're always saying the combo of jeans and a great white T is the holy grail of outfits? Exhibit A: This photo of Beyoncé, whose perfectly-fitted look proves that all you need are red lips, red nails and some stylish sneakers (like her custom python pair from Taxidermy) for a look that's both chic and completely effortless. You can fight the '90s resurgence all you want, but Rachel is here to say it's here, it's happening, and it's time to get out your print babydoll dresses and chunky clogs (hers are Tory Burch). And maybe some brick-colored lipstick, while you're at it. Yes, the star's Elle Sasson chambray dress is super-charming, and yes, her Gucci bag should have been in our closet, like, yesterday, but at the moment, it's her whimsical Jason Polan for Soludos \"Burger and Fries\" smoking slippers that are giving us particular outfit envy. Your outfit inspiration awaits, courtesy of Jessica Alba, Jamie Chung, Jennifer Lopez and more stylish celebs The model's matched set from Twenty is the perfect blank canvas for any look, but we love her \"dressed down\" approach with her stacked Ash sneakers and Miu Miu glasses, plus a denim jacket for cooler temps. When we say \"double denim,\" you immediately think \"jean jacket and skinnies,\" right? But Emmy's evolving the look by topping a pair of J Brand boyfriend jeans with a chambray Gap halter, then adding classic CH Carolina Herrera accessories to balance out the tomboy effect. A summer sandal in basic black would be the obvious choice to go with Naomie's pretty print Burberry dress, which is why it's so noteworthy that she gave the whole look a twist with mirrored silver loafers and a matching Jimmy Choo clutch.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Born: April 14, 1931 Died: April 15, 2015 Family: He is survived by his wife, Doris Ann (Bourguignon); and three children, six grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, two brothers and a sister. Personal: Lucy Brubaker, a member of Bethany Children's Home Ladies Auxiliary, said she still attends Faith United Church of Christ, Grantville, Dauphin County, one of two churches where Henning was the pastor before serving at Bethany. A Henning legacy from that pastorate was years of camping trips with six or eight church families to Maine or Myrtle Beach, S.C., she said. The camping trips continue and the participant numbers have grown to 35 or 40 people, spanning generations. Susan Schmehl tells the story of one of the teens at Bethany's Children's Home, Womelsdorf, climbing a tree and refusing to come down. \"No one could get him out of the tree, so they finally went to 'Rev.' (the Rev. Dr. Harold A. Henning, longtime executive director of the home) for a solution,\" said Schmehl, 69, of Wyomissing, who worked as development director at Bethany for many years. Henning, seldom at a loss for a creative solution, had one for the tree-boy. He ordered the boy to get his backside out of the tree right away. \"OK,\" said the kid, complying respectfully. So, what does that anecdote say about Henning? It says he was direct and plain-spoken when conveying his feelings. It also demonstrates he was well-respected. And that was because he was honest, hardworking, creative and perhaps, just like most any other kid at heart, he loved baseball, fishing and camping. And children and adults ultimately loved him for all of that. At his core, Henning believed in lasting relationships and was committed to taking the time to make them. \"He was a wonderful father figure to hundreds of children,'' said his oldest son, Jon Henning of Robesonia, who worked with his father as a social worker for years. \"One employee once said of him, 'He could step on your toes and not scuff your shoes.' \" That's an outstanding human art. Henning of South Heidelberg Township died in April at age 84. He was assistant to the superintendent at Bethany from 1966 until 1985 and executive director from 1985 to 2000. He was named Executive Director of the Year for 1993 by the Council for Health and Welfare Services of the United Church of Christ. \"He was an excellent administrator and loved the kids,\" said his successor, the Rev. Alan Miller, 63, of Schnecksville, Lehigh County, United Church of Christ Penn Northeast Conference minister. \"After he retired from Bethany, he was the interim minister here before I came,\" Miller said. \"He had a wonderful sense of humor and when he laughed his whole body laughed.\" Miller praised Henning's positive vision and people skills that allowed him to get things done. \"I don't know what initially drew him to children,\" said Schmehl, except that when children have needs we tend to respond and advocate for them. Schmehl said when the Conrad Weiser School District closed a day-care program, Henning had a new proposal within three days to move the day care to Bethany. \"He was always finding ways to address needs of children,\" she said. \"He was a wonderful man,\" added Gary Neider, 62, Bethany's retired director of social work, who told of Henning's straightforward compassion. \"When my dad was being treated for cancer three days a week, he (Henning) was very supportive and told me just to do what I had to do and to keep my hours flexible,\" Neider said. \"He was a strong leader, but a very approachable person.\" Hundreds of people came to pay their respects to Henning at his funeral. \"We had to keep putting up chairs because the church could hardly hold everybody,\" Jon said. That's another legacy of love to a man who once told a child in no uncertain terms to get out of a tree, desiring that he embrace life with all its complexity and be well-grounded.

In addition to being charged Wednesday in the three robberies that occurred throughout last week, David O. Border, 22, had an outstanding arrest warrant for burglary in the May 11 break-in of Trooper Thorn's Irish Beef House in Reading. Border and his 16-year-old accomplice were arrested by city detectives Tuesday in the 300 block of North 11th Street, Sgt. John M. Solecki of the criminal investigations section said. Border ran out the back door when officers arrived at a relative's home but officers had the residence surrounded and took him into custody. Border admitted to committing the robberies in the 1100 block of Elm Street after conspiring with the 16-year-old girl he described as like a sister to him, according to court papers. He was committed to Berks County Prison in lieu of combined $80,000 bail after arraignment Tuesday night before Senior District Judge Richard A. Gatti in Reading Central Court. He is charged with three counts of robbery, three counts of making terroristic threats, one count of aggravated assault and related counts, as well as burglary-related charges. According to investigators: Each of the victims had conversed for a period of time with the girl, who put her profile on dating sites such as Meet24 and MeetMe. She arranged to meet the men at specific addresses within the 1100 block of Elm Street. Border waited and Elm and Locust streets and confronted the men when they arrived for the rendezvous. He told them they needed to stop talking with his “sister” because she was less than 18 years old, then demanded money and their cellphone. On July 13 about 12:30 a.m., Border robbed a man of $80 and his cellphone, valued at $120. The victim wasn't injured. On July 15 at 10:30 p.m. Border robbed a man of $116 and his cellphone, valued at $300. The victim wasn't injured. On Sunday about 7 p.m., Border assaulted and robbed a man of his cellphone, valued at $200. He repeatedly punched the victim because he wouldn't give up his phone, then picked up a large rock and threatened to beat him with it until he surrendered the device. The victim in the July 15 robbery gave investigators the profile information of the girl he had arranged to meet and police identified her through her photo. Police recognized the photo because the girl was reported as a runaway by her family, Solecki said. She was charged with robbery and conspiracy as a juvenile and is being detained in Abraxas Academy to await a hearing before Berks County juvenile authorities. In the Trooper Thorn's burglary, Reading police said Border forced open a window screen in the rear of the building to get inside. Surveillance video shows he unsuccessfully tried to take a TV before taking 10 bottles of liquor worth about $200, five cases of beer valued at about $100 and a case of Red Bull energy drink valued at about $36.

Archie started his life in Bulgaria, but through the tireless efforts of his new parents, would find a fresh life filled with love and support in the United States.

The process to adopt Archie wasn't an easy one, but you can tell just how much it means to both children to have each other in their lives. Day to day they are inseparable, and share a care and a love for one another that I'd argue most siblings would be envious of. It pains my heart to know that boys like Archie are afterthoughts in some societies, but as long as there are people in the world like Ace and her parents, children with Down syndrome will have a chance to lead a happy life. Currently there are approximately 400,000 people in the United States with Down syndrome, which knows no race or socioeconomic background. We feel that Archie's story of finding love and acceptance needs to be heard, so spread little Ace's words to the world if you feel the same. Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",

Her touching tribute has been viewed over 2.6 million times, which shows just how impactful her feelings towards Archie really are. Ace begins by explaining how Archie started his life in Bulgaria, but states that,\"When the doctor said he had Down syndrome, the mom said she couldn't keep him.\" After admitting to the camera that she didn't quite understand why Archie's first mother couldn't keep him, she shrugs the notion off by saying, \"but whatever, I'm just happy he's my brother.\" Archie's loving relationship with his sister was shared with the world in honor of World Down Syndrome Day, which this past March just celebrated its 10th anniversary. Currently there are approximately 400,000 people in the United States with Down syndrome, but Ace's hope is that by watching her video Archie will not be treated differently, because as she puts it, \"he's just like any other kid.\"",

The name End to End comes from the graffiti coup of decorating the entire length of a train without being disturbed. The building's 800kg doors are made out of wooden sleepers and iron rails and concrete sleepers support ceilings.

Not only do people want to work in a building celebrating graffiti, they are happy to pay more.

Can End to End, the group's second graffiti building after the residential Hive in Carlton, sustain graffiti's authentic edge as the former blue-collar area gentrifies? Tzaros hopes it will, but National Gallery of Victoria senior curator David Hurlston, who started exhibiting street art in the 1990s, says amid a continually changing genre the building will, at best, be a reminder of an age. \"It has a particular richer cultural relevance right at the moment, but into the future it might just be a moment in time that's captured as part of the building,\" Hurlston says.",
    "LabBody": "Buildings, along with train carriages, have provided the canvas for graffiti artists since the practice of scribbling over someone else's property took off in its modern form in New York City in the 1960s. Now, graffiti-covered trains are adorning buildings. Those who see graffiti as a blight already probably avert their eyes from the letter-laden walls of Melbourne's gritty inner-north. In Collingwood's Easey Street they're advised to also avoid looking up. A new five-storey building, modelled on a train platform, features three retired Hitachi electric engine cars perched on its roof gutted to create habitable space. It's a permanent marker of graffiti's role in Melbourne's evolving history and shows how far graffiti has come by giving it a physical form. \"It's part of the landscape now,\" says Theo Tzaros, one of three partners in the $8-million End to End building. \"[Graffiti]'s fused with architecture.\" Like it or hate it, it's certainly a feature of Melbourne, where tourists wander with smartphones among the city's many graffitied laneways. Graffiti works by big-name street artists can pull huge sums – auction house Sotheby's sold UK artist Banksy's Untitled (F--- The Police) in February for £209,000 ($436,000). The scope of the transformation from vandalism to cultural pin-up is personified in developer Tzaros. He's better known by his alter ego, Prowler, a revered figure in Melbourne's graffiti and street art circles.

Stretching your body two or three times a week or after each aerobic or strength training workout can improve circulation and range of motion in your joints. Stretching can even promote better posture and relieve stress. Yoga poses, dancing, and touching your toes can effectively stretch your body. Fruits and Veggies A healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables can promote physical fitness because it relaxes blood sugar that can help prevent overeating, explains Harvard School of Public Health. Most people should aim for at least 4 cups of fruits and veggies each day. Good choices include spinach and other dark leafy vegetables, or any produce that's red such as raspberries and bell peppers, or yellow or orange like melons, bananas and carrots. Outlook Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you become more physically fit. Consider your personal goals, interests and possible barriers when developing a fitness program. Talk to your health-care provider before starting a new workout routine, especially if you've been inactive.",
    "LabBody": "Engaging in regular physical activity may be one of the most important things you can do for your health. Exercising for 30 minutes or more at least five days a week can lower the risk of heart disease, improve bone and muscle strength and help control your weight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Incorporating a variety of activities into your workout routine can help you stay physically fit. Aerobic Exercise. Aerobic or cardiovascular exercises like brisk walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling help strengthen your heart because it keeps it pumping at a higher rate for an extended period of time. Aerobic activities also help manage blood pressure and cholesterol, strengthen the spine and prevent weight gain while improving your energy level and simply making you feel good, explains the University of Maryland Medical Center. Anaerobic Exercise. While aerobic exercise involves lower intensity sustained for several minutes or even hours, anaerobic exercises are short and fast, and they help increase muscle strength. Activities that involve quick bursts of energy such as sprinting or heavy weightlifting are defined as anaerobic. A combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercises are needed for the development of physical fitness, explains the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Strength Training. Strength or resistance training can build stamina and help replace body fat with lean muscle mass, which encourages your body to burn calories more efficiently. Strength training also helps counteract muscle loss associated with aging. Pushups, pullups, lifting free weights or working out on weight machines are all examples of resistance-training activities. Exercises that work the major muscle groups should be performed two or three times per week for best results. Stretching. Stretching is an important element in a fitness program. Stretching your body two or three times a week or after each aerobic or strength training workout can improve circulation and range of motion in your joints.

Oh--and Washington's been nom'd for an Emmy. The actress had a banner year: in addition to the success of Scandal she took a lead role in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained and starred in Tyler Perry's Peeples. Look for Washington to mount this list in 2014: in addition to a salary increase she'll begin to enjoy earnings off of a unique (and early) syndication deal: starting this fall each episode of Scandal is expected to air on BET no earlier than eight days after its original broadcast.

Matt Stamey/Staff photographer/File Published: Wednesday, July 8, 2015 at 6:01 a.m. Last Modified: Tuesday, July 7, 2015 at 11:20 p.m. School: South Carolina Year: Junior Position: Wide receiver Height: 5-foot-11 Weight: 208 pounds Why he's No. 6: Cooper is one of the most dynamic and versatile offensive players in the nation, an All-SEC performer last season who has emerged as a strong All-America candidate heading into the 2015 season. A legitimate triple threat (or more), Tennessee certainly can attest to his ability to make plays in a lot of different ways. In last year’s game against the Vols, Cooper caught 11 passes for a school-record 233 yards and two touchdowns. And that was just part of the damage he inflicted on the Vols. He also rushed for a touchdown and threw a 30-yard touchdown pass. Cooper also is a dangerous kick and punt returner. With the Gamecocks breaking in a new starting quarterback this season, Steve Spurrier will be very creative in finding ways to put Cooper in a position to make plays. Cooper emerged as a potential playmaker as a true freshman, then had a breakout season in 2014, catching 69 passes for 1,136 yards and scoring 11 touchdowns. In his career, he’s had five plays of 70 yards or longer — two rushing and three receiving. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition. All rights reserved.

It's now available at Whole Foods Nashua. \"I started this company because I love food and feeding people,\" Grillon says via press release. \"I grew up in New Orleans, where food is a way of life, a place where before you are done with one meal, you are talking about what your next meal is going to be. \"I have loved cooking ever since I was a child. One of my earliest memories is of being in the kitchen with my maw maw (grandmother) watching cooking shows on television while she prepared a meal for the family. I watched her put love into every meal she cooked for our family, and I could taste it. I believe that people can taste when food is made with love, and just as my maw maw did, I put love into all the food I cook; when I cook, my food comes from the soul,\" Grillon said. NOLA's Salsa comes in two varieties: Salsa Fresca - a traditional tomato-based, raw blended salsa that most people associate with Mexican food; and Fire Roasted Corn \u0026 Black Bean Salsa - a full-flavored, smoky salsa that combines roasted corn, roasted tomatoes and fresh cooked black beans, great for quesadillas, fajitas and pastas. Both are packed with chunky ingredients and powerful flavors. I'm a huge garlic fan, and this salsa delivers that taste along with the salt and spices that will add \"pow\" to your tortilla chips. The Salsa Fresca does indeed taste just like the homemade one I make from my own garden ingredients, and the Fire Roasted variety adds the smokiness and more substantial chunks of corn and beans. NOLA's contains no preservatives, no sugar, no oils, and no artificial colors or flavors. NOLA's salsas are also vegan and gluten-free.

Co-owner Amy Bouzaglo said Thursday that she and husband Samy Bouzaglo are in final negotiations to sell the property in Scottsdale but that they are keeping the Amy's Baking Company name. She plans to focus on making desserts for Phoenix-area restaurants and online instructional cooking videos. The decision had nothing to do with lingering negative publicity from the show, though people on social media have assumed otherwise, she said. \"People want to say we're desperate and closing and bankrupt,\" Bouzaglo said. \"Sorry, we're not. Sorry to burst your bubble.\" The couple drew outrage and ridicule after a profanity-laced appearance on a May 2013 episode of \"Kitchen Nightmares\" that ended with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay walking away. \"Every day since the show has aired, I have received some kind of death threat,\" Bouzaglo said. \"Any other person on this planet, I don't know if they would have survived what we went through because it was horrible.\" Bouzaglo maintains the producers of the Fox series edited footage to paint her as a volatile restaurant owner. \"They got their drama,\" Bouzaglo said. \"It's OK. It is what it is. We learned. There's no hard feelings with anybody.\" The couple say they opted to sell because they also had issues with the building's former landlord. Bouzaglo says the landlord allowed construction in other spaces in the shopping center that led to a sewer-like odor seeping into their restaurant. taboola sponsored listings",

The Glandon is the biggest test of the stage and the peloton will be whittled down significantly on its slopes. All-rounders should fare best today. Winner: Yellow Jersey: Points Leader: Mountains Classification: Stage 19: Friday, July 24 – St-Jean-de-Maurienne to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles – 138km Summit finish number five takes Chris Froome back to La Toussuire, site of his now famous “attack” on team-mate Sir Bradley Wiggins at the 2012 Tour. First, though, the riders must tackle the Glandon again – going up in the opposite direction this time – before carrying on over the Col de la Croix de Fer. It’s only a short day but the barrage of climbing means the riders will be tired by the time they reach the foot of the final ascent and weaker legs will be ruthlessly exposed on the long climb. Winner: Yellow Jersey: Points Leader: Mountains Classification: Stage 20: Saturday, July 25 – Modane to Alpe d’Huez – 110.5km This short but savage stage visits two iconic Tour climbs: the enormous Col de la Croix de Fer and the legendary Alpe d’Huez. There probably won’t be much to split the favourites over the Croix de Fer, which weighs in at a sapping 29km, but there should be one last scrap between the yellow jersey hopefuls on the hairpins of the climb to Alpe d’Huez. Whoever leads the race at the top will win overall. Winner: Yellow Jersey: Points Leader: Mountains Classification: Stage 21: Sunday, July 26 – Sevres to Paris – 109.5km The race ends with the traditional – and largely processional – sprint stage into Paris, finishing on the Champs-Elysees. The race leader will sip champagne with team-mates early in the day and only has to avoid crashing to seal victory. But that’s easier said than done when the sprint teams start cranking up the pace ahead of the the bunch finish. Winner: Yellow Jersey: Points Leader: Mountains Classification:",

    "DiffbotBody": "In the second of a series of four features, Matt Nesbitt breaks the PL player pool down position by position. Taking a look at the key stats from last season to highlight every teams’ top performers and give us a steer for the upcoming campaign. Let’s look at the defenders… All players must’ve played 15 matches to be considered and have been measured in the following categories: Appearances (Apps), Clean Sheets (CS), Assists (Ass), Goals (Gls), Yellow and Red Cards (YC, RC). Players are listed per team, in recommended order of Fantasy value, or appeal for next season. Chelsea Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Ivanovic 38 17 (44%) 6 4 10 1 Azpilicueta 27 14 (51%) 4 0 1 1 Terry 38 17 (44%) 0 5 2 0 Cahill 34 14 (41%) 1 1 5 0 To ponder: Branislav Ivanovic will be top of many manager’s list and rightly so. Ever present, with excellent clean sheets, assists and goals contributions. No reason to think anything will change this season. John Terry managed every minute of every PL match, but with another year on the clock that will prove difficult to repeat. So left-back Cesar Azpilicueta gets the nod as 2nd most eligible. Man City Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Zabaleta 29 11 (37%) 5 1 6 1 Mangala 25 11 (44%) 0 2 3 1 Kolarov 16 9 (56%) 3 2 4 0 Demichelis 28 9 (32%) 0 1 6 0 To ponder: Pablo Zabaleta had a poor season by his high standards, but still turned in some decent numbers and remains the City ‘banker’. Eliaquim Mangala found his feet in the second half of the season and stopped finding those of his opponents – after six yellow cards and one red in his first ten matches for City, he didn’t get any in his most recent ten. The French stopper looks first choice, so squeezes Aleksandar Kolarov into third place. Can’t fault the Serbs’ stats, but there are doubts over how often he will play. And who for. Arsenal Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Koscielny 26 11 (42%) 0 3 4 0 Mertesacker 35 12 (34%) 1 0 2 0 Bellerin 17 7 (41%) 1 2 5 0 Monreal 25 9 (36%) 2 0 3 0 To ponder: Laurent Koscielny remains Arsenal’s key defender for Arsene Wenger and Fantasy managers alike. But question marks remain over the full-backs. Calum Chambers and Keiran Gibbs don’t make the list, but their figures aren’t very different from Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal. Plus, a fit again Mathieu Debuchy will also challenge. Man United Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Smalling 20 5 (25%) 0 4 1 1 Jones 21 6 (28%) 1 0 3 0 Rojo 20 6 (30%) 0 0 6 0 To ponder: Not many clues here. Neither Luke Shaw nor Jonny Evans played enough matches to qualify (although Evans posted a by far the best CS ratio – 38%). Smalling looks the best of a bad lot as it stands, but expect a new face or two – Coleman and Ramos have been mooted and would instantly be the pick. With - an injury-free - Luke Shaw the next best option. Tottenham Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Trippier* 38 10 (26%) 4 0 2 0 Rose 27 6 (22%) 5 3 7 0 Dier 26 6 (23%) 4 2 4 0 Vertongen 31 7 (22%) 0 1 6 0 *Playing for Burnley To ponder: New right-back Kieran Trippier gets the nod based on impressive figures achieved in a struggling team – just two bookings is remarkable – and we can expect better. Danny Rose and Eric Dier both contributed well going forward, but Dier is yet to nail down a position. And will face competition from Jan Vertongen and Federico Fazio, who should both have a bigger influence this time around. Liverpool Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Clyne* 35 13 (37%) 1 2 4 0 Skrtel 33 12 (36) 0 1 8 0 Moreno 28 7 (25%) 0 2 6 0 Wisdom** 22 8 (32%) 1 0 1 0 Sakho 16 7 (43%) 0 0 1 0 *Playing for Southampton **Playing for West Brom To ponder: Nathaniel Clyne should hit the ground running at right back, so pips Martin Skrtel – who is never far from a howler and/ or cards. Spanish full-backs Jose Enrique and (on loan) Javier Manquillo managed just 11 games between them, so Alberto Moreno looks the next best option. Andre Wisdom is back from a decent spell at West Brom and could be a wildcard. Southampton Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Bertrand 34 13 (38%) 3 2 3 1 Fonte 37 15 (40%) 2 0 5 0 Yoshida 20 6 (30%) 1 1 3 0 To ponder: Nothing much to choose between Ryan Bertrand and Jose Fonte, the ex-Chelsea man getting the nod on his attacking potential. Southampton’s defensive record might suffer for the loss of their England full-back and influential players further forward. But we said that last year. Arriving right-back from Sporting Lisbon Cedric Soares might be worth a look. Swansea Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Taylor 34 13 (38%) 3 0 9 0 Williams 37 13 (35%) 0 0 6 0 Fernandez 28 10 (35%) 0 0 0 0 Rangel 23 7 (30%) 0 0 1 1 To pondor: Left-back Neil Taylor heads a solid list, especially reliable at home and v bottom six teams. Ashley Williams attracts regular attention from ‘bigger’ clubs, but Federico Fernandez offers equal appeal – and didn’t pick up so much as a booking in the PL. The arriving £3 million French left-back Franck Tabanou looks like cover for Taylor – who is partial to the odd yellow card. Stoke Apps CS (%) Ass Gls YC RC Shawcross 31 6 (19%) 1 2 7 0 Pieters 29 7 (24%) 2 0 8 0 Muniesa 17 6 (35%) 0 0 3 0 To ponder: Last season Stoke had the 4th best defence on the road.

    "LabBody": "Friday, July 03, 2015. In the second of a series of four features, Matt Nesbitt breaks the PL player pool down position by position. Taking a look at the key stats from last season to highlight every teams’ top performers and give us a steer for the upcoming campaign. Let’s look at the defenders… All players must’ve played 15 matches to be considered and have been measured in the following categories: Appearances (Apps), Clean Sheets (CS), Assists (Ass), Goals (Gls), Yellow and Red Cards (YC, RC). Players are listed per team, in recommended order of Fantasy value, or appeal for next season. Chelsea. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Ivanovic. 38. 17 (44%) 6. 4. 10. 1. Azpilicueta. 27. 14 (51%) 4. 0. 1. 1. Terry. 38. 17 (44%) 0. 5. 2. 0. Cahill. 34. 14 (41%) 1. 1. 5. 0. To ponder: Branislav Ivanovic will be top of many manager’s list and rightly so. Ever present, with excellent clean sheets, assists and goals contributions. No reason to think anything will change this season. John Terry managed every minute of every PL match, but with another year on the clock that will prove difficult to repeat. So left-back Cesar Azpilicueta gets the nod as 2nd most eligible. Man City. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Zabaleta. 29. 11 (37%) 5. 1. 6. 1. Mangala. 25. 11 (44%) 0. 2. 3. 1. Kolarov. 16. 9 (56%) 3. 2. 4. 0. Demichelis. 28. 9 (32%) 0. 1. 6. 0. To ponder: Pablo Zabaleta had a poor season by his high standards, but still turned in some decent numbers and remains the City ‘banker’. Eliaquim Mangala found his feet in the second half of the season and stopped finding those of his opponents – after six yellow cards and one red in his first ten matches for City, he didn’t get any in his most recent ten. The French stopper looks first choice, so squeezes Aleksandar Kolarov into third place. Can’t fault the Serbs’ stats, but there are doubts over how often he will play. And who for. Arsenal. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Koscielny. 26. 11 (42%) 0. 3. 4. 0. Mertesacker. 35. 12 (34%) 1. 0. 2. 0. Bellerin. 17. 7 (41%) 1. 2. 5. 0. Monreal. 25. 9 (36%) 2. 0. 3. 0. To ponder: Laurent Koscielny remains Arsenal’s key defender for Arsene Wenger and Fantasy managers alike. But question marks remain over the full-backs. Calum Chambers and Keiran Gibbs don’t make the list, but their figures aren’t very different from Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal. Plus, a fit again Mathieu Debuchy will also challenge. Man United. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Smalling. 20. 5 (25%) 0. 4. 1. 1. Jones. 21. 6 (28%) 1. 0. 3. 0. Rojo. 20. 6 (30%) 0. 0. 6. 0. To ponder: Not many clues here. Neither Luke Shaw nor Jonny Evans played enough matches to qualify (although Evans posted a by far the best CS ratio – 38%). Smalling looks the best of a bad lot as it stands, but expect a new face or two – Coleman and Ramos have been mooted and would instantly be the pick. With - an injury-free - Luke Shaw the next best option. Tottenham. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Trippier* 38. 10 (26%) 4. 0. 2. 0. Rose. 27. 6 (22%) 5. 3. 7. 0. Dier. 26. 6 (23%) 4. 2. 4. 0. Vertongen. 31. 7 (22%) 0. 1. 6. 0. *Playing for Burnley. To ponder: New right-back Kieran Trippier gets the nod based on impressive figures achieved in a struggling team – just two bookings is remarkable – and we can expect better. Danny Rose and Eric Dier both contributed well going forward, but Dier is yet to nail down a position. And will face competition from Jan Vertongen and Federico Fazio, who should both have a bigger influence this time around. Liverpool. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Clyne* 35. 13 (37%) 1. 2. 4. 0.

To ponder: Nathaniel Clyne should hit the ground running at right back, so pips Martin Skrtel – who is never far from a howler and/ or cards. Spanish full-backs Jose Enrique and (on loan) Javier Manquillo managed just 11 games between them, so Alberto Moreno looks the next best option. Andre Wisdom is back from a decent spell at West Brom and could be a wildcard. Southampton. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Bertrand. 34. 13 (38%) 3. 2. 3. 1. Fonte. 37. 15 (40%) 2. 0. 5. 0.

Southampton’s defensive record might suffer for the loss of their England full-back and influential players further forward. But we said that last year. Arriving right-back from Sporting Lisbon Cedric Soares might be worth a look. Swansea. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Taylor. 34. 13 (38%) 3. 0. 9. 0. Williams. 37. 13 (35%) 0. 0. 6. 0.

Ashley Williams attracts regular attention from ‘bigger’ clubs, but Federico Fernandez offers equal appeal – and didn’t pick up so much as a booking in the PL. The arriving £3 million French left-back Franck Tabanou looks like cover for Taylor – who is partial to the odd yellow card. Stoke. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Shawcross. 31. 6 (19%) 1. 2. 7. 0. Pieters. 29. 7 (24%) 2. 0. 8. 0. Muniesa. 17. 6 (35%) 0. 0. 3. 0. To ponder: Last season Stoke had the 4th best defence on the road. The season before, the 4th best at home.

Reid was less impressive than his contract demands would suggest last term, contributing a miserly three clean sheets and a clumsy ten yellow cards in his 27 matches. West Brom. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Lescott. 34. 15 (44%) 2. 1. 3. 0. McAuley. 23. 12 (52%) 0. 1. 2. 1. Dawson. 29. 11 (37%) 0. 2. 6. 0. To ponder: Despite a huge 52% clean sheet average – bettered only by Man City’s Aleksandar Kolarov - Gareth McAuley is pipped by an outstanding showing from Joleon Lescott. With Pulis at the helm, West Brom won’t be shipping goals so Lescott is well worth a look. The same goes for Chris Brunt if he is re-categorized as a defender, having spent most of last season at left-back. From 33 matches, he provided nine assists and two goals. Leicester City. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Schlupp. 30. 8 (26%) 2. 3. 4. 0. Morgan. 37. 10 (27%) 2. 2. 1. 1. Wasilewski. 24. 6 (25%) 2. 1. 6. 0. To ponder: A madcap season will not have inspired many Fantasy managers to stock up on Leicester defenders, but from the list right-back Jeffrey Schlupp is the pick. Although Robert Huth posted the outstanding figures from his 13 matches (six clean sheets, 46%). Newcastle Utd. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Janmaat. 37. 8 (21%) 6. 1. 6. 1. Dummett. 24. 5 (20%) 0. 0. 4. 0. Coloccini. 32. 7 (21%) 0. 1. 3. 1. Williamson. 27. 5 (18%) 1. 1. 5. 2. To ponder: On the subject of madcap… Realistically speaking, only right-back Darryl Janmaat warrants more than a cursory look. And even then through rose tinted lenses. The chaotic Fabricio Coloccini and Mike Williamson were symptomatic of Newcastle’s season and until some evidence of stability is restored, a complete swerve is recommended. Sunderland. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Van Aanholt. 25. 7 (28%) 5. 0. 4. 0. Vergini. 30. 10 (33%) 0. 0. 6. 0. O’Shea. 36. 12 (33%) 0. 0. 4. 0. To ponder: An eye-brow raising number of clean sheets for Sunderland – nine 0-0 draws accounts for three quarters of them. But the ‘Goals Against’ column negated most of the benefit. Left-back Patrick van Aanholt tops Sunderland’s list on account of five assists. An injury-free Sebastian Coates plus new faces should improve the landscape, but exercise caution. Aston Villa. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Vlaar. 19. 7 (36) 1. 0. 3. 1. Cissokho. 25. 7 (28%) 0. 0. 1. 0. Richardson. 15. 5 (30%) 1. 0. 2. 1. To ponder: No Villa defender played more than 25 matches, which only hints at their problems. Their best performer Ron Vlaar was released in the summer and the arrival of Micah Richards won’t answer all of Villa’s defensive issues. Bacuna missed the cut because he only played 11 matches, but they produced a commendable four clean sheets and five assists. However, all Villa defenders should be handled with care. Promoted teams: It would be remiss of us not to have a sneak peek at what the three promoted teams have to offer next season. The volume of clean sheets will be hard to maintain in the PL, but will give us a guide – as will the goal and assist totals… Bournemouth. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Cook. 46. 19 (41%) 1. 5. 10. 0. Francis. 42. 18 (42%) 6. 1. 8. 1. Elphick. 46. 19 (41%) 2. 1. 6. 0. To ponder: Five goals tells us centre-back Steve Cook offers a goal threat. And ten yellow cards suggest he will threaten the odd opponent too. Right-back Simon Francis attacking play might make him this season’s Keiran Trippier. Watford. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Angella. 32. 14 (43%) 4. 2. 5. 2. Cathcart. 28. 10 (35%) 2. 3. 7. 0. To ponder: Gabriele Angella was the star of Watford’s back-four, contributing well in all departments. But the two red cards might raise a query, particularly when you consider one was earned inside a minute. Craig Cathcart too offers a goal threat from centre-back. Norwich. Apps. CS (%) Ass. Gls. YC. RC. Whittaker. 40. 15 (37%) 5. 2. 3. 0. Martin. 48. 14 (29%) 5. 2. 8. 0. Olsson. 45. 13 (28%) 5. 1. 8. 0. To ponder: Right-back Steven Whittaker and centre-back Russell Martin are both Scottish Internationals and capable of contributing going forward as well as defensively. Martin Olsson matched their impressive five assists last season and provides a threat from the left flank. Next up we’ll be turning the spotlight on midfielders.

    "DiffbotBody": "Update: iOS 9 beta is now available to download by the public. Here's how to install iOS 9 and what it's all about. iOS 9 is Apple's next iPhone and iPad update now that iOS 8.4 has launched with Apple Music, and it brings a smarter Siri, public transit directions to Maps, true tablet multitasking and new built-in apps. Unveiled on June 8, it's Apple's new big project between April's Apple Watch launch and September's expected iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus unveiling, and it's not just being tested by developers. An iOS 9 public beta has launched with improved stability, a smaller download size and legacy phone and tablet compatibility. That older iPhone and iPad you have will work with this update if it runs iOS 8. New iOS 9 features consist of redesigned built-in apps and a few premiers new ones. There's also more functionality than ever for iPads. Here's what to expect with the full release. iOS 9 release date iOS 9 is available to everyone enrolled in Apple's free public beta program or its iOS developer program. The latter launched first at WWDC, but requires becoming a registered developer by paying a yearly fee. Everyone else who wants the final version of iOS 9 for free has to wait until later this year when it's expected to launch with the new iPhone. Think: September. That two month wait can be a good thing. iOS 9 beta 1 and beta 2 were buggy and unfinished. The best features typically don't launch until the gold master version, anyway. iOS 9 compatibility iOS 9 is proving to be more inclusive than previous iOS versions. Apple is choosing to make this update compatible with older iPhone, iPad and even iPod touch devices, too. Okay, it's not technically more inclusive just yet. Basically, if your dated hardware runs iOS 8, it can run iOS 9. When the rumored iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPad Air 3 and iPad mini 4 launch, then the list will grow by four, or five if there's an iPhone 6C. Overall, it's good news, as older phones and tablets aren't getting muscled out. The iPhone 4S and iPad 2 are safe, for now, and a few 30-pin dock devices live on. Smarter Siri Siri in iOS 9 is getting the much-needed smarts to rival Google Now. Apple's personal assistant understands the word \"it\" within context and brings proactivity to the operating system. For example, if you're talking about a topic with someone in iMessages and ask Siri to \"Remind me about 'this' later today,\" it'll scan the open app and try to understand what \"this\" means. iOS 9 proactivity puts even more at your fingertips through Siri. It suggests appointments to add to Calendar, and pulls up photos based on location and time with the sound of your voice. Siri's location-based knowledge appears to be most promising when you're out and about. Plugging in headphones at the gym? It'll offer the Now Playing interface right on the lockscreen. Plugging it into your car? It'll bring up that audiobook you were listening to before. It'll even tell you when to leave for an appointment across town, a feature that has made Google's app for iOS a must-have. Siri in iOS 9 also knows your location and what you like to listen to in the car or gym One of the most convenient new iOS 9 features is giving context to random numbers that call you, diving into your email to see if it can match the digits. Goodbye, telemarketers - we hope. Siri already takes over one billion requests a week, according to Apple. That should only increase now that iOS 9 promises to make Siri 40% faster and 40% more accurate. Apple Pay expands Apple Pay has been touted as a success, but so far has been limited to the US. That all changes when the mobile payment platform launches in the UK this month. The official Apple Pay UK release date is rumored to be July 14, and it'll be backed by nearly 70% of credit and debit cards there, including Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and HSBC. Canada and China are thought to be next up for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus mobile payment platform, but the company hasn't announce that broad of an expansion just yet. In the US, Apple Pay is now backed by 2,500 US banks and, this fall, rewards and store-issued cards will be a part of the mobile wallet. This is an idea we liked about Android Pay at Google IO in May. Considering these newfound iOS 9 capabilities, Apple is renaming Passbook (the app where Apple Pay resides) to Wallet. Apple Maps Apple Maps is sometimes unavoidable, even if you're a dedicated Google Maps users. Siri and built-in apps still open directions up in the default navigation app. That won't change. The good news is that iOS 9 is going to make Apple Maps better, and maybe even tolerable. In its first major refresh since 2013, the app now includes long-awaited public transit directions. That means routes for buses, trains, subways and, yes, even ferries are part of Apple Maps. This goes live this fall in Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, New York City, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay Area, Toronto and Washington D.C. Notably, it'll support directions for 300 cities in China, a huge emerging market for the iPhone, including hotspots like Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai. Apple News apps In addition to getting rid of Passbook in favor of Wallet in iOS 9, Apple is replacing Newsstand with News, and it's very familiar if you're a fan of magazine-style news aggregators. Apple News for iOS 9 is Flipboard, HTC BlinkFeed and Feedly wrapped into one app. It features a personalized feed and is coming to US, UK and Australia at launch. No telling if publishers will wrap their content in the fresh Apple News format. The advantage to you, however, is more clear: your data will remain anonymous, apart from your Apple ID, promises the company. Multitasking for iPad iOS 9 brings true multitasking to its newer iPad tablets, and we're not talking about the \"multitasking\" app switcher that premiered with iOS 4 back in 2010. iPads will finally be able to handle more hefty productivity tasks. That's to the delight of enterprise users who prefer iOS for personal use, but feel forced to opt for a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 or Android tablet at work. There are three ways to view multitasking windows on an iPad. Slide Over brings a second app from the side so you can answer a text or write something in Notes. It's just as easy to slide away. There's also a special Picture-in-Picture mode that puts videos and FaceTime calls in the corner of the display when the home button is pressed. From there, you can use any other app while watching the video. Google's YouTube app for iOS works this very same way, at least within that specific app. Both Slide Over and Picture-in-Picture are compatible with newer iPads: iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3. The last mode, Split View, is an iPad Air 2-only affair. Split View is the mode that everyone imagines when they hear the word \"multitasking.\" It enables two apps to be open side-by-side and they're both active at the same time, with full multitouch support. While Apple isn't ready to announce the long-rumored 12-inch iPad Pro, it's clearing honing in on the enterprise user with its latest tablet software features. New iOS 9 keyboard Apple launched what it called its \"best keyboard yet\" with the iOS 8 QuickType, and it's trying to one-up that statement with the iOS 9 keyboard. iPad's on-screen keyboard now features a built-in shortcut bar, which flanks the next-word suggestions above the QWERTY letter keys. Cut, copy and paste to the left; bold, italic, underline and attachments to the right. That's better than having to hunt for these shortcuts in the second layer of the keyboard menu, and in a surprise move, Apple is making this default layout customizable and compatible with third-party keyboard apps. Cursor control is now easier with a handy (or fingery) slide mechanic when using two fingers. It basically turns the iPad QuickType keyboard into an trackpad. It's way easier than hovering over the tiny cursor, trying to land in between letters. Finally, shortcuts are coming to wireless keyboards so that you can interact with apps using their own built-in shortcut keys. Pressing and holding the Command, Option or Control key brings up the shortcut list. Under the hood New features are exciting and all, but iOS 9 needs to run better than iOS 8, which had a series of Wi-Fi and battery drain problems from the get-go. Some users are still complaining. Longer battery life is a chief concern of iPhone users, but they can squeeze out an extra hour thanks to a new Low Power mode. Apple says iOS 9 pulls switches you didn't even know existed to save juice. You may be able to install iOS 9 this time around without deleting all of your photos. It'll take about 1.3GB, whereas iOS 8 needed massive 4.5GB of internal storage. That was awful on a 16GB iPhone. CPU and GPU usage will be more efficient thanks to iOS 9, further improving performance, and security is said to be stepped up. Hopefully that means last year's iCloud hack isn't going to be an annual incident. Not mentioned during Apple WWDC keynote, a \"Move to iOS\" app is hidden within iOS 9. It'll be easier to wirelessly switch from an Android device to a new iOS phone or tablet. iPhone and iPad may be surprised when asked to enter a six-digit passcode instead of an easier-to-crack four digit code. But it's the difference between one million possible combinations and 10,000 and Touch ID really makes the hassle a moot point. Better safe than sorry. Apple's rather confident iOS 9 public beta is showing a lot of promise, even if it's an incremental update. Google's Android M is taking the same cautious approach. We'll see how they both turn out this fall. See more Operating systems news",

There's more functionality than ever for iPads, and we may see some additional, unannounced Force Touch capabilities and motion wallpaper. Here's what to expect with the full release in mere days. iOS 9 release date. iOS 9 became available to everyone in July if they were enrolled in Apple's free public beta program and, before that, at WWDC, through its fee-required iOS developer program for true beta testers. Everyone else who wants the final, stable version of iOS 9 for free has to wait until \"later this year,\" according to Apple, when it's expected to launch with the new iPhone. Think: September. The iPhone 6S launch event date is Wednesday, September 9. In the past, iOS updates have typically launched the following Wednesday, which would be one week later, September 16, this time around. That two-week wait is a good thing. iOS 9 public beta versions have been a bit buggy and unfinished. A few of the best operating system features won't don't launch until the gold master version, anyway. iOS 9 compatibility. iOS 9 is proving to be more inclusive than previous iOS versions.

When the rumored iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus and iPad Pro launch on September 9, then the list will grow by three. It'll become a total of six when the iPad Air 3, iPad mini 4 and iPhone 6C eventually release. Basically, if your dated hardware runs iOS 8, it can run iOS 9, and that's good news, as older phones and tablets aren't getting muscled out.

Apple Pay has been touted as a success over the last 11 months in the US, and now the iPhone-backed mobile payment platform has made its way to the UK. The official Apple Pay UK launch of July 14 was backed by nearly 70% of credit and debit cards there, including Bank of Scotland and HSBC. Canada and China are thought to be next up for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus mobile payment platform, but the company hasn't announce that broad of an expansion just yet.

This is an idea we liked about Android Pay at Google IO in May. Considering these newfound iOS 9 capabilities, Apple is renaming Passbook (the app where Apple Pay resides) to Wallet. We'll see if it's enough to compete with the September 28 launch of Samsung Pay on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and its other new Android phones. Apple Maps. Apple Maps is sometimes unavoidable, even if you're a dedicated Google Maps user. Siri and built-in apps still open directions up in the default navigation app. That won't change. The good news is that iOS 9 is going to make Apple Maps better, and maybe even tolerable. In its first major refresh since 2013, the app now includes long-awaited public transit directions.

Notably, it'll support directions for 300 cities in China, a huge emerging market for the iPhone, including hotspots like Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai. Just don't expect it much more than that to sway you from Google Maps or Waze. The design changes are minimal and, as we point out in our iOS 9 review, it clearly needs more work. Apple News apps. In addition to getting rid of Passbook in favor of Wallet in iOS 9, Apple is replacing Newsstand with News, and it's very familiar if you're a fan of magazine-style news aggregators. Apple News for iOS 9 is Flipboard, HTC BlinkFeed and Feedly wrapped into one app. It features a personalized feed and is coming to US, UK and Australia at launch. There's also Apple News integration outside of this app right on one of the home screens. Four or five snippets of news appear within the left-most menu, right below spotlight search, recent contacts and recent apps. In this way, Apple is mimicking Samsung's left-most Flipboard menu, with less pizzazz. No telling if all of your favorite publishers will wrap their content in the fresh Apple News format. The advantage to you, however, is more clear: your data will remain anonymous, apart from your Apple ID, according to the company. Multitasking for iPad. iOS 9 brings true multitasking to its newer iPad tablets, and we're not talking about the \"multitasking\" app switcher that premiered with iOS 4 back in 2010. iPads will finally be able to handle more hefty productivity tasks.

Shorts are context sensitive and include cut, copy and paste to the left; bold, italic, underline and attachments to the right. That's better than having to hunt for these shortcuts in the second layer of the keyboard menu, and in a surprise move, Apple is making this default layout customizable and compatible with third-party keyboard apps.

Finally, shortcuts are coming to wireless keyboards so that you can interact with apps using their own built-in shortcut keys. Pressing and holding the Command, Option or Control key brings up the shortcut list. iOS 9 Wi-Fi problems fix. Apple has also worked out a solution for when your Wi-Fi connection is proving to be a massive pain. It's called Wi-Fi Assist, and it'll automatically drop your Wi-Fi connection and jump onto your mobile network whenever it's struggling. You can switch it off if you're on a limited data package but it's a great idea for those who have spotty Wi-Fi connections and get annoyed at having to manually control it. Under the hood.

    "DiffbotBody": "Initially, many media organisations are launching smartwatch apps that offer news notifications. But there is immense opportunity to create apps that communicate social status and personal interests as well. Let us start with a comparison. A typical Rolex or any premium/luxury watch has only one or two “apps” – generally the time/date and one other (such as altitude), yet Rolex sells about 700,000-800,000 watches annually. The cheapest Apple Watch will cost about US$349. The average AndroidWear watch costs US$189. So what? We can infer that there is little correlation between functionality and pricing in watches. Certainly in the 1600-1700s, there must have been a direct relationship between accuracy of time-keeping and price of watches. However, as time became a commodity, premium watch manufacturers started positioning watches less as functional products and more as signaling devices (communicating taste, wealth, standing, or a combination of these), charging primarily for their ability to do more than simply keep time. Gradually, much of the value and pricing premium in watches (as with other luxury products) came to rest with their signaling prowess, not notification ability. Notifications rule When we look at the Apple Watch, we find that all apps that have been developed seem to be targeting its notification ability and not its signaling prowess. This is true not just of the Apple Watch apps from big-name players such as Evernote and WeChat, but also apps from news media companies such as The New York Times, the Guardian, and CNN. Let us look at these apps. What is NYT doing? It is focusing on one-sentence stories, summing up the gist of the story in one sentence. It will also allow the user to save the story for a later read using the “save for later” option or pass the story to the user’s iPhone using Handoff. What is The Guardian planning? The Guardian has created an app called Moments. This consists of short, snappy screens containing content that is tailored for the time of day. Almost all news media apps can be generically understood in terms of screen size reduction. Content is tailored for a quick glance on the small watch screen. As a standard example, here is CNN’s app for Apple Watch. Fundamentally, these are all notification plays, modifying or replicating the message meant for the notification screen on the Apple Watch display, with any action restricted to Save to Read Later or Handoff to iPhone/iPad. In comparison, when we look at notification apps from Target, Uber, and Evernote, they take advantage of the Apple Watch’s ability to track time and location, and they link delivery of the notification to a specific time and location. Additionally, they allow simple actions to be done throught the watch app: Target’s app allows you to add items to your list and find aisle locations for items. Uber’s watch app allows you to order a car, etc. These make for an experience native to the Apple Watch, (i.e., one that cannot be replicated on a smartphone or any other device). Mathew Ingram, a leading media journalist, has covered the above and the associated problem of noise emanating from all the zillions of alerts that each of the news media apps will throw at the user in his blog post on Medium. News publishers rushing to develop apps for the Apple Watch thus risk the following: They are all essentially making apps doing the same thing – notifying users about news. Yes, there will be attempts at personalisation, relevancy, etc., but it will take time. And remember, they don’t get any access to data! In the short run, all of the similar news alerts will risk annoying the user. They are playing in the functional end of the market, where there is limited maneouverability to extract a premium. We saw earlier how watches are able to extract a pricing premium primarily on account of their role as signaling devices. So what should news publishers do? If signaling is indeed the key to capturing value, then publishers should focus on tailoring their apps to convey signaling and not notifications. Historically, prominent news brands have always had some latent signaling power. Take The Guardian or Fox News. To consume these is to say something about yourself and your political or social views. We can also see it in formats. Today, as print newspapers’ notification power has dropped sharply, their signaling power has risen manifold. To carry a copy of the Financial Times or The New York Times in your hands today is to make a statement about yourself. Still, these have largely been historical happenstances and less conscious acts (barring, perhaps, Fox News). How can a news publisher today drive signaling through the Apple Watch? Let me illustrate this through an example. Could a newspaper that thinks Indiana’s anti-LGBT legislation is abhorrent offer a special screensaver to people who wish to signal their protest? What if the screensaver was designed by a renowned artist and sold for US$3 with some money going to charity? Could there be a digital equivalent of the “Je Suis Charlie Hebdo” button on the Apple Watch? The Apple Watch offers a unique landscape to map personal views of news and one’s individual positioning. It is the first digital product that can signal facets of your personality – your interests, your passions. If I am a mountaineering nut, could the screen have glowed gently or pulsated on the day Jorgensen and Caldwell free-climbed El Capitan? If I am obsessed about math, could I get the watch to light up to celebrate John Nash being awarded the Abel Prize? How do I show I care? How do I show I protest? However, at present, there is a challenge. Presently, the Apple Watch goes blank to save energy. The screen comes alive only when you turn your wrist toward your face. This does pose an immediate challenge to signaling and screensavers, but, very soon, I am certain there will be possibilities to override the “screen off” mode by inserting features in apps that make it pulse/glow intermittently, or allow users to leave on a screensaver. Improved battery life is a must for this last point, though. For this to truly take off, one key additional accessory will need to emerge. It is likely in the works. This is the “smart” band. Reports have emerged about the existence of a small port that could emerge as the node to exchange information between a smart band and the watch. The biggest selling smartwatch, Pebble, has a similar concept that is called smartstraps. So, could The New York Times or any news brand sell a unique smart band, which allows the colour or even the message on the band to change depending on arising news (such as when your favourite sports team wins) or even to draw attention to the wearer’s beliefs, causes, etc.? We know that NYT Labs has been experimenting with wearables and information signaling. A recent Popular Mechanics story reported that “one of the lab’s researchers recently designed a brooch programmed to light up whenever a topic is mentioned that matches something the wearer read about online that day. What good would that do, exactly? Boggie answers with enthusiasm, ‘We don’t know yet!’” Allow me now to get back to where we started. Let us look at two of the Apple Watch models side by side. The standard Apple Watch has about 50 apps, is stainless steel, and sells for US$549. The Apple Watch gold edition has about 50 apps, is 18ct gold, and sells for US$15,000. Both watches have the same functionality and the same innards. The only difference is the outer material (not even the straps). Yet Apple is pricing the gold edition US$14,500 more than the stainless steel edition. This is the signaling premium. The signaling premium is not a fixed amount. Rather it is any amount for which an app can be sold for the ability to convey or signal information to the outside world. At present, this signaling premium is targeted exclusively through hardware (gold). How soon before software emerges to tap this premium? How much of this software and signaling premium can news organisations tap into? To conclude, publishers focusing exclusively on notification-driven apps are missing a huge opportunity. The Apple Watch presents a unique landscape to signal one’s personality and passions, one that consumers will be willing to pay a premium for. This is a revenue opportunity that news publishers are best poised for – being able to connect what is happening (news, events, etc.) with the interest areas of the users – and need to start thinking about. Also worth reading: Jack Riley, Huffington Post UK’s head of audience development, published a report as part of his Nieman Visiting Fellowship on how publishers should engage with wearables/smartwatches. It is almost entirely focussed on the notification end of the opportunity. It is a well-written report and certainly worth a deep read.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Tackle Mason Halter, who transferred from Fordham, seems like the best of the transfers but it’s going to be a culture shock for him to go up against SEC defensive linemen. The Associated Press Published: Monday, June 29, 2015 at 1:53 p.m. Last Modified: Monday, June 29, 2015 at 1:53 p.m. The Back Nine comes at you after a weekend that included my wedding anniversary, The Bob Dooley Invitational and my daughter, Jennifer, getting engaged. So, yes, I am an emotional mess right now. 10. You’re probably tired of the doom and gloom that is being predicted for the Florida football team this season. You’ve probably grown weary of hearing how this is going to be a tough season for Jim McElwain in his first year. Unfortunately, the only way that’s going to change is for Florida to go out on the field and beat somebody and that won’t have a chance to happen for another couple of months. So the drumbeat continues. The latest comes from the Golden Nugget, which annually releases around this time of the year its spreads for college football’s biggest games. The sports book has Florida as being the underdog in seven games. Here they are, with opponent and spread: Tennessee -3, Missouri -5.5, Ole Miss -6, LSU -14, Georgia -12, South Carolina -2.5, FSU -4. Florida was actually a double-digit underdog at Missouri before the spread adjusted. These expectations for Tennessee seem a little out of whack, but the Vols are favored to beat both Oklahoma and Florida early in the season. 11. There has certainly been some good news on the Florida football front with the addition of three transfers who will be able to play right away. I wouldn’t get too excited about any of them, but just the addition of bodies at positions of need should be a positive. Tackle Mason Halter, who transferred from Fordham, seems like the best of the transfers but it’s going to be a culture shock for him to go up against SEC defensive linemen. Center T.J. McCoy transferred from N.C. State but hasn’t played college football yet. We certainly are all saying prayers for his father, Tony, an absolute stud at Florida under Steve Spurrier, who is battling leukemia. And Anthony Harrell, who transferred from Georgia Tech, gives Florida another body at the linebacker position. At this point, with other possible transfers from other schools and junior college ranks unable to get into school at Florida, the Gators needed some numbers. 12. Also while I was immersed in this golf tournament McElwain announced the improvements that will be made to the Keys Residential Complex. I’ve talked to numerous coaches about recruiting in the last couple of months and they all told me the same thing — that all the waterfalls and lazy rivers and indoor practice facilities are great, but what matters the most is housing. Think about where an athlete spends most of his time. That has to be comfortable. “It’s the only thing that really matters,” one Power Five head coach told The Back Nine. 13. Also last week, the NBA draft came and went and nobody was really surprised to see Florida’s early entrants get snubbed. I think the best thing for Chris Walker would be to go somewhere — whether it be in America or overseas — and just play and play and play some more until he learns how to play basketball. In the case of Michael Frazier II, he is a one-dimensional player whose stock went down at workouts. Meanwhile, I find myself intrigued by Justin Leon, the junior college transfer who Michael White has added. Every once in awhile it seems like some team in the SEC gets a JUCO kid who makes an immediate impact on the league. Maybe it’s Florida’s turn. 14. This time in two weeks we’ll be in Hoover, Ala., for the unofficial start of college football season. Hope you enjoyed your summer. This will be the first SEC Media Days for new commissioner Greg Sankey, but I don't expect anything to be different. If it’s not broke, you know. It’s just hard to believe it’s already upon us. But it’s also exciting to know it’s almost here. 15. There is no possible way to thank everybody who made some contribution to the 21st Bob Dooley Invitational at Ironwood. It was as close to perfect as we have had. The prizes were phenomenal thanks to so many great people in Gainesville and around the country. The staff at Ironwood led by Jeff Cardozo was phenomenal. We won’t have a total for awhile, but I think the Jordan Spieth signed and framed Masters flag got the highest bid. The food was everywhere, the weather was perfect and the pace of play was the best yet. Maybe it’s a good one to go out on. Who am I kidding? My brother, Tim, is already working on next year. I’ll miss for the next few months getting a big prize in from FedEx or UPS, taking a picture and sending it to him with the message “boom!” And getting those same messages from Tim and my sister, Joni. The tournament is about so many things and first and foremost helping Stop Children’s Cancer. But it is also about families, and not just mine. Again, to anyone who was involved Saturday, I can’t thank you enough. Gainesville is the best. 16. I’ve always felt Florida has more rivals than any other school. But I’m starting to think it may be Ohio State. And it’s because the Buckeyes fans seek them out. They’re selling T-shirts in Columbus that say “ROLL TEARS ROLL” with the score of last year’s College Football Playoff win over Alabama. They love to taunt, don't they? 17. The Tweet of the Week comes from Gainesville’s own Vernon Maxwell — “The player I had the toughest time defending in my career was Drazen Petrovic. I'd rather guard MJ any day. Drazen used to light me up. Lol” It’s not the tweet that is newsworthy, but the fact Mad Max is on Twitter. Keep an eye on his account. 18. When you are running a golf tournament, it’s easy to get sucked in by comfort food and skip workouts because you have other things to do. So this needs to be a good week. Maybe a new playlist will help: • “Crystals” by Of Monsters And Men. • “Comets” by Fanfalo. • “Dreams” by Beck. • “Moaning Lisa Smile” by Wolf Alice. • And for an oldie and because I saw the heartbreaking documentary on him Sunday night, “Wichita Lineman” by Glen Campbell.

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "LANCASTER — First-round co-leader Jane Park stumbled with a 2-over 72 Friday and fell out of a three-way tie for the top spot midway through the second round of the U.S. Women’s Open. Park had clawed into a tie for first with Karrie Webb and Marina Alex earlier Friday with a birdie and four pars as she and 54 others completed their opening rounds. Play was halted late Thursday when storms pounded Lancaster Country Club. Webb, a two-time champion, and Alex, a second-year LPGA player, were part of Friday’s afternoon wave along Amy Yang, who opened at 3 under. Other afternoon starters included defending champion Michelle Wie (72), Lydia Ko (70) and 2014 runner-up Stacey Lewis (69). Park, the 2004 U.S. Amateur champion, played steadily through most of 23 holes Friday, with 12 straight pars in the middle of her round. But she had bogeys at the seventh, ninth and 10th and made just one birdie, at the 12th. She has managed to stay in contention despite ranking last in the 154-player field in driving distance, offsetting her lack of punch with pinpoint approach shots. “I give up a lot of distance off the tee, but my irons and my woods are very, very accurate,” she said. “And fortunately, I’ve got a pretty good hold of how far I’m hitting all of my clubs. And the greens are very soft, very receptive. So I’m able to go at pins when you need to and the ball seems to be stopping right where you want it to.” She said difficult second-round pin placements made the hilly 6,400-yard William Flynn layout in the heart of Amish country play tougher than in the opening round. “I thought the pins were very difficult today,” she said. “My proximity to the hole was probably between 15 to 25, 30 feet, and a lot of them broke two or three feet. It wasn’t exactly a day where I could be very aggressive with my putts because the pin placements were very difficult.” She stands at 2 under, along with top-ranked Inbee Park, who offset two bogeys with a pair of birdies for an even-par 70. Inbee Park, the 2008 and 2013 winner, was satisfied with her consistent play over 22 total holes Friday. But she was quick to point out what held her back from making a move: her putting. “It’s really tricky and it really gets me all the time,” she said. “Every time I stood over it, and I know this is the U.S. Open, I just keep leaving it short. And it’s disappointing, because it just stops just in front of the edge.” Sei Young Kim made the biggest move of the morning wave. The South Korean shot a 67 after an opening 73 and was at even par along with Taiwan’s Min Lee (68). Kim’s caddie was removed from the championship this week by the U.S. Golf Association for taking photos of internal notes on the course setup.",

    "DiffbotBody": "HO CHI MINH CITY— Vanessa and Vicky Wiesenmaier say the poaching of rhinoceroses is gruesome: hunters tranquilize the animal and then cut off the horn. When the rhino wakes up it slowly bleeds to death. The sisters were so appalled by the killings in their native South Africa that they embarked on a bicycle tour to raise awareness in Asia, where consumers buy horn products they believe cure everything from cancer to hangovers. At tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram, the horns are a luxury item sometimes gifted to bosses and officials. “To know that these animals are killed for pure greed and money, for some funny belief that the horn is a status symbol, that’s a tragedy,” Vicky, 35, said. While stopping at a guesthouse near the Laos-Vietnam border, she and her sister told VOA the issue was personal. The Wiesenmaiers spoke of a friend in South Africa who had four of the six rhinos on his reservation slaughtered. He decided to leave the carcasses out so that travelers could see the results of poaching. “We saw live rhinos before that, so to see this crumbled, dead thing, it was really shocking, it was disgusting,” Vicky said by Skype. The sisters said their love of wildlife came from all their time spent in the South African bush, such as visits to national parks. “Basically, you set up your tent in these parks next to a watering hole and watch animals come and go, and it’s just the most amazing holiday,” Vanessa, 30, said. But that’s changed as poachers have devastated the indigenous species. “At the moment some of these parks are absolute war zones.” World’s top horn consumer: Vietnam The sisters are cycling 6,000 kilometers over the course of half a year, pausing in multiple cities to tell locals, “Buy no rhino,” which is the rhyming name of their campaign. They have stopped by several schools and will do so again in September when they return to Vietnam, which is the biggest consumer of rhino horns in the world. Vanessa and Vicky show students a presentation about the harms of the horn trade, hold a discussion and then have students create artwork on the topic. Activists are reaching out to students in hopes they’ll be more open-minded and then pass on the message to their parents. Vietnamese businessmen, celebrities, and state officials are “the strongest driver of the current rhino poaching crisis,” according to a 2013 report by wildlife group TRAFFIC. For their bike tour, the Wiesenmaiers joined Operation Game Change, a campaign to convince Vietnamese that powder made from rhino horns has no proven medicinal value. “In general, people understand the problem” of poaching, said Hoang Vu Lan Phuong, project coordinator at the Freeland Foundation, which runs the campaign. “But when it comes to protecting their health and their family's health, they're going to still go out and do it. So that’s what we want to change, is their attitude.” Poaching on the rise Advocacy in Vietnam has focused on curbing demand for horn products. Besides the bike tour, groups have raised awareness through workshops, posters, and a film contest. They’re also working on the supply side, by urging governments globally to update their laws, seize contraband, and prosecute traffickers. South Africa and Vietnam are the key countries involved in the supply and demand sides of the rhino trade, respectively. Data from Operation Game Change show that 1,215 rhinos were poached in South Africa in 2014, compared with 122 rhinos five years earlier. On their tour, the Wiesenmaiers will cover China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.",

The car is being printed by Local Motors, which printed the world's first 3D-printed car last year. (Photo : University of Michigan) There are many areas of tech that are currently being heavily researched and developed, including 3D printing and autonomous driving technology. Researchers at the University of Michigan, however, are combining those two technologies, having developed a 3D-printed self-driving car dubbed the \"SmartCart.\" \"Think Uber, but with low-speed, autonomous cars,\" said associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science Edwin Olson, who is the lead of the team behind the car. \"The goal of SmartCarts is for us to begin understanding the challenges of a transportation-on-demand system built around autonomous cars.\" Of course, the entire car isn't 3D-printed, with the cart using the same powertrain as would be found in a golf cart. Everything else, however, is 3D-printed, with parts being printed by Arizona-based company Local Motors. The reason that the team decided on 3D printing is because it's far quicker than traditional manufacturing methods, making it great for prototyping an experimental technology like autonomous cars. For example, if the team needs to install a different type of sensor, they can easily print out a different casing that will be more accommodating for that sensor. Local Motors itself is the company behind the world's first 3D-printed car, which was unveiled last year. Not only that, but it hopes to begin sales of 3D-printed cars that are more like golf carts in 2016. Within the next decade, it hopes to open up 100 \"microfactories\" around the world, where parts can be printed for local communities and companies. Clearly, this vehicle isn't designed to hit the roads, but rather could be used in things like airports or university campuses. A prototype is currently being tested at the University of Michigan, with the team concentrating on developing autonomy and a mobile interface for the cars and a potential transport system for a campus environment. \"On this project, we're deliberately 'cheating' on the autonomy as much as we can — not because we can't build autonomous cars, but because we need a working test bed now so that we can begin to look at all of the other challenges of an on-demand system,\" continued Olson. The vehicle will be tested at Mcity, an autonomous vehicle test site created by the Mobility Transformation Center at the University of Michigan. Through this testing, the team will develop new methods to simplify challenges associated with autonomous technology, adding things like campus landmarks to help cars navigate and even painting lines for cars to follow.

Drug overdoses have increased dramatically in Etowah County in recent years. A great many of the overdose deaths recorded come from the use of heroin or opiate-related drugs such as pain medications. “We're seeing two or three a week,” Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin said. “Just the other day, I had to talk to a mother after her son overdosed. She had no idea he was using heroin.” Many families are aware of drug problems, Chief Deputy Michael Barton said, and the law would allow family members or an individual at risk of drug overdose to get a prescription for the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride, approved by the Federal Drug Administration for treating an overdose. It only works on opiate-based drugs, but Entrekin said his understanding is that it is not harmful to give if it's not known what the person overdosed on. Doctors and dentists who prescribed the drug and people who administer it in good faith would have immunity from prosecution. The law also allows people immunity from prosecution for some offenses if they seek help for someone who has overdosed. Entrekin said when officers are at the scene of a drug overdose, they typically find other people taking drugs as well as paraphernalia and drugs. The law should alleviate the worry that if a drug user calls police about a friend's OD, he or she will end up in jail. “They don't need to worry about that,” Entrekin said. “They need to worry about saving someone's life. “We're in the business of arresting people for drug offenses,” the sheriff said, “but saving lives is more important.” Sen. Phil Williams, R-Rainbow City, said when the bill came up in the Senate Judiciary Committee, it didn't take a lot of discussion to approve it. “The bill is designed to increase access and immunity related to the dispensing and use of counter-narcotic medications, especially by law enforcement,” he said. “Often times, when an individual is in the midst of an overdose, there is a very limited window of opportunity to administer Narcan or other such counter-narcotics.” Narcan is a name brand of naloxone hydrochloride. “This bill will allow key individuals, such as family members of a recovering addict or law enforcement, to have access to Narcan so that it can be administered in as quick a time frame as possible,” Williams said. “It is hoped that it will become as vital to saving lives as portable defibrillators and epinephrine pens. “I have seen it administered by an EMT during an overdose situation, and it is amazing what it can do.” The component of the law that will let law enforcement officers administer it sets a Jan. 1, 2016, deadline for the Alabama Department of Public Health to develop a training program for officers. Barton said the law does not require law enforcement agencies to carry the drug, and Etowah County will need to find a funding source. Entrekin said he intends to make the opioid antagonist available for officers — starting with the county's school resource officers. “I want to at least provide it for our SROs because they are in contact with an at-risk population,” he said. “If any one of our school children (needs) help, we want to provide it immediately.” It will be a challenge to provide the drug for all deputies. Entrekin said the drug costs about $50 a dose, and Barton said it has a shelf life of about a year. While that's a small price to pay to save a life, it would be a big expense to give all deputies the drug just in case they encounter someone overdosing. Once the state health department develops the training program for administering the drug, Entrekin said, “We will have people in the first class.” Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

Phil Williams, R-Rainbow City, said when the bill came up in the Senate Judiciary Committee, it didn't take a lot of discussion to approve it. “The bill is designed to increase access and immunity related to the dispensing and use of counter-narcotic medications, especially by law enforcement,” he said. “Often times, when an individual is in the midst of an overdose, there is a very limited window of opportunity to administer Narcan or other such counter-narcotics.” Narcan is a name brand of naloxone hydrochloride. “This bill will allow key individuals, such as family members of a recovering addict or law enforcement, to have access to Narcan so that it can be administered in as quick a time frame as possible,” Williams said. “It is hoped that it will become as vital to saving lives as portable defibrillators and epinephrine pens. “I have seen it administered by an EMT during an overdose situation, and it is amazing what it can do.” The component of the law that will let law enforcement officers administer it sets a Jan. 1, 2016, deadline for the Alabama Department of Public Health to develop a training program for officers. Barton said the law does not require law enforcement agencies to carry the drug, and Etowah County will need to find a funding source. Entrekin said he intends to make the opioid antagonist available for officers — starting with the county's school resource officers. “I want to at least provide it for our SROs because they are in contact with an at-risk population,” he said. “If any one of our school children (needs) help, we want to provide it immediately.” It will be a challenge to provide the drug for all deputies. Entrekin said the drug costs about $50 a dose, and Barton said it has a shelf life of about a year. While that's a small price to pay to save a life, it would be a big expense to give all deputies the drug just in case they encounter someone overdosing. Once the state health department develops the training program for administering the drug, Entrekin said, “We will have people in the first class.” Law regarding OD drug will save lives. July 10, 2015 10:17 PM. \u003cp\u003eMany pieces of legislation may be touted as life-saving, but probably few have greater direct life-saving potential than a law passed in the last session that increases access to a medication that can reverse the deadly effects of a drug overdose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrug overdoses have increased dramatically in Etowah County in recent years. A great many of the overdose deaths recorded come from the use of heroin or opiate-related drugs such as pain medications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We're seeing two or three a week,” Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Just the other day, I had to talk to a mother after her son overdosed. She had no idea he was using heroin.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany families are aware of drug problems, Chief Deputy Michael Barton said, and the law would allow family members or an individual at risk of drug overdose to get a prescription for the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride, approved by the Federal Drug Administration for treating an overdose. It only works on opiate-based drugs, but Entrekin said his understanding is that it is not harmful to give if it's not known what the person overdosed on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoctors and dentists who prescribed the drug and people who administer it in good faith would have immunity from prosecution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe law also allows people immunity from prosecution for some offenses if they seek help for someone who has overdosed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEntrekin said when officers are at the scene of a drug overdose, they typically find other people taking drugs as well as paraphernalia and drugs.

I'm fully ensconced just 10 minutes' stroll from London Bridge and with brilliant views of the city's new Lego skyline: the Shard, the Walkie-Talkie, the Cheese Grater and the Gherkin (and now hotly anticipating the Botox Syringe and the Barclays Private Bank Safe Key). The local newsagent knows me, the charcuterie around the corner knows me and the bartenders certainly know me. I'm practically a native. Yet I still can't summon any energy. Back home I'm up with the sun; now, I'm useless until midday. What gives? Having consulted Belle Gibson, I briefly contemplate announcing my terminal prognosis. Despite some initial (and mutual) trepidation, things are now peachy with my housemate, Milton Friedman the mini goldendoodle.

    "DiffbotBody": "At the end of June, the Greek government instituted capital controls — limits on how much money can be drawn from banks — after negotiations with the eurozone broke down and the country's fiscal and monetary lifelines disappeared. Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "DiffbotBody": "WILKES-BARRE — A promoter and founder of an entertainment business has been charged for a shooting that injured one person inside Passion Lounge on Scott Street early Friday morning. City police obtained an arrest warrant for Ronald Drayton, 46, of 20 Abbott St., Wilkes-Barre, charging him with six counts of reckless endangerment and one count each of aggravated assault, illegal possession of a firearm and firearms not to be carried without a license. Drayton claims to have 17 years of experience in the entertainment industry and founder of Black N’ Out Entertainment, according to his website. His Twitter feed stated he was at Passion Lounge Thursday night promoting Troy Ave, a rapper from Brooklyn, New York. Police identified the victim as Marcese Cloward Grant, according to the criminal complaint. A police officer in the area heard a gunshot just before 2 a.m. and saw patrons running out of Passion Lounge. Security at the lounge claimed a shot had been fired inside the club. A 9mm shell casing was found inside the club and a Glock pistol with an altered serial number was found in the parking lot, the complaint says. Surveillance cameras recorded a fight between several men before security staff broke it up. As security was escorting patrons from the club, another fight broke out, police said. Drayton was recorded by surveillance cameras bumping Grant before brandishing a handgun and pistol whipping Grant. In return, Grant threw a punch toward Drayton at which security officers grabbed Grant from behind taking him to the floor. Drayton allegedly fired a shot that struck Grant in the leg before running out the door, the complaint says. Grant also ran out as police learned he showed up in the emergency room of Commonwealth Health Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, and was transported to Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Plains Township. Police described Grant’s injury as non-life threatening. In a related incident, police charged Daquan Lloyd Jones, 24, of Brooklyn, New York, with illegal possession of a firearm and firearms not to be carried without a license. Police allege Jones was at Passion Lounge and got drunk, went to a friend’s apartment on Airy Street, Wilkes-Barre, and passed out on a couch. A landlord arrived at the Airy Street apartment just before 9 a.m. to conduct an inspection. When no one answered the door, the landlord entered the apartment allegedly finding Jones on a couch with a handgun at arms reach, police said. Police allege the handgun near Jones had an altered serial number. Jones was jailed at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility for lack of $250,000 bail.

    "DiffbotBody": "Those in charge of safety on local rivers and lakes have strengthened their plea for people to learn to swim or put on a life jacket before heading into the open water, after a teenage boy and a young man drowned in Sonoma County waterways on the Fourth of July. Marquette Gross, 14, died after falling off an inflatable water toy being towed across Lake Sonoma on the same day 20-year-old Jose Campos-Campos perished in the Russian River near Monte Rio Beach. Neither knew how to swim and neither was wearing a life jacket, officials have said. “If you can’t swim, wear a flotation device. It’s so simple,” said an exasperated-sounding Steve Baxman, chief of the Monte Rio Fire Department. He’s responded to numerous drownings on the Russian River over the years and helped save many others from the same fate. “I wish it wouldn’t happen. These people are too young to be dying.” As he and others were out scouring the river near Monte Rio Beach for Campos last Saturday, they assisted in the rescue of three other near-drowning victims, he said. And there are many other close calls each year that go unnoticed, said David Robinson of Sonoma County Regional Parks, which in 2013 created a river safety patrol whose three-person team also has prevented many drownings. Baxman, Robinson and officials with the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake Sonoma say much already is being done to prevent such tragedies, but that more work is needed, including expanding swim class offerings and overcoming a perception of life vests as uncool and unmanly so that more teenage boys and men will wear them. Baxman sits on the board of the Monte Rio Recreation and Park District, which oversees the beach where Campos accessed the water before he drowned. While signs there warn of river hazards, not everyone reads them, he said. Board members want to offer river swim lessons so people can learn the specific challenges of swimming in moving water. But they have struggled to find swim instructors, he said. “If we get instructors it will happen this summer,” he said. For now, some of the nearest swim lessons to the Russian River are provided at Ives Pool in Sebastopol. It’s one of the many locations around the county a bilingual swim program called Vamos a Nadar, or Let’s Go Swimming, is offered. Organized now by Sonoma County Regional Parks, Vamos a Nadar was developed more than a decade ago by a county water safety coalition created in response to a spike in drownings on the Russian River between 2001 and 2003. About 75 percent of the 21 who died in that short period were Latino, prompting the creation of lessons in both English and Spanish. Parents must accompany their children to the one-day program, which provides an introduction to water safety and swimming. Kids go home with a voucher for steeply discounted swim lessons. comments powered by Disqus",

Parents must accompany their children to the one-day program, which provides an introduction to water safety and swimming. Kids go home with a voucher for steeply discounted swim lessons. As of last year, parents can also return for adult swim lessons at Ives Pool, pool manager Ricardo Freitas said. Donors Chris and Virginia Anderegg have provided scholarships for adults who otherwise couldn’t afford the lessons, funding the classes for 11 of about 15 people so far this summer. The pool also provides swim lessons to every Sebastopol and Graton second-grader each spring through a collaboration with the Sebastopol Rotary Club. “It’s very sad to me to see a kid, 14 years old, and a man in his twenties die because they don’t know how to swim,” Freitas said. “It’s on my heart to teach the most people we can.” The efforts appear to be working: Just one person drowned in the Russian River each year from 2009 to 2011, compared to five in 2003, according to data from the Sonoma County Regional Parks department. But in 2012, the county saw another spike in river drownings. The people who died were either too old to participate in Vamos a Nadar or were from outside the county, Robinson said. Recognizing the need to reach people on the river who might be from out of town and without access to local swim lessons, county parks in 2013 created the Russian River Water Safety Patrol, where a park ranger and two open-water lifeguards are stationed at popular county beaches to educate the public about water safety. Robinson said many underestimate the river’s danger, unaware of how strong the current can be or that ankle-deep water can suddenly drop off into a 12-foot hole. Part of the safety patrol’s job is to educate people about those holes and how they change from year to year. And both the county parks department and the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake Sonoma have set their sights on getting life jackets into the hands of as many people as possible. Starting this month, Sonoma County Regional Parks brought on bilingual interns to distribute the vests at popular county beaches Thursday through Monday. Part of their challenge is finding new donors so they can buy enough life vests to meet demand, Robinson said. On July Fourth, they ran out by noon after passing out about 400. But it’s not a matter of simply providing life jackets: They must also overcome cultural resistance to wearing them. State law requires that any water-going vessel must be equipped with a life vest for each person on board; additionally those under 13 must be wearing a properly fitted life jacket, said Mike Dillabough, chief of operations and readiness for the Army Corps of Engineers San Francisco district. However, there are no laws requiring swimmers of any age to wear them, he said. “What we’ve found out is that across the nation, mothers are generally pretty good at this stuff, at wearing their own and getting their kids to wear (life jackets),” Dillabough said. “But teenage boys and men tend not to wear them.” He says the Army Corps has studied making life vests mandatory but found that doing so was not particularly effective. Instead they’re trying to get people to don them voluntarily. “That’s where you wonder how we can do better,” he said. “We’re trying to make the safety message more interesting.” Efforts include stationing “trees” of free life vests at every public access point on Lake Sonoma. On busy weekends like July 4, rangers come by frequently to restock and offer vests to those without them, he said. Bins where the vests can be returned are provided. Free life vests were also available at the private marina where 14-year-old Marquette Gross’s family was visiting, he said. The Army Corps of Engineers is developing a new advertising campaign that speaks to teenage boys and men and tries to make wearing a life jacket seem tough. Already, a sign near a stand of free vests at Yorty Creek Recreation Area shows Navy Seals crawling on a beach and says, “The toughest guys in the world wear life jackets!” At the Russian River, Robinson said concerted efforts to get children to wear life vests have begun to rub off on adults who see their kids having fun with them. “It’s kind of the theme of our beaches,” he said. “Peer pressure in a really positive way: ‘You wear a life jacket, I wear a life jacket.’” Staff Writer Jamie Hansen blogs about education at extracredit.blogs.pressdemocrat.com.

    "DiffbotBody": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Welcome to life in the spotlight, D'Angelo Russell. Literally. So here's the scene: A group of reporters were gathered in a semicircle along one side of a cramped hallway after the Los Angeles Lakers played the Minnesota Timberwolves in the summer league opener for both teams on Friday night. Russell left the locker room and weaved his way through the maze of bodies and took his spot along the wall. He then made a rookie mistake and looked directly into a superbright light attached to one of the television cameras. \"Can't see,\" he said, wincing. Lesson learned, and that's what summer league is about for the No. 2 pick in this year's NBA draft. The Lakers' point guard of the present and the future made his pro debut Friday night, and did a little of everything. He had eight points, seven fouls (you can go all the way to 10 in Las Vegas before fouling out), six assists, five rebounds, five turnovers and three steals. The final score that will be forgotten quickly if not already: Minnesota 81, Lakers 68. Of course, that doesn't really matter. The night was about the debut of the No. 1 pick in the Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns, the return of Lakers forward Julius Randle and the start of Russell's pro career. \"It might be a little too early to tell,\" Lakers coach Byron Scott said, when asked if he already sees something special about Russell, much in the same way the team did with Kobe Bryant nearly two decades ago. \"His vision on the court is special. Every practice he's done something that's better. He has some things he can do on the court that can make you smile. I'm really excited about that. He's still 19 years old, but we're really excited to see this young man play.\" Everyone at UNLV, it seemed, was excited. The biggest crowd in Las Vegas summer league history was there, including Houston's James Harden sitting on one of the sidelines and taking in the show. Extra seats in the upper deck had to be opened to accommodate the crowd, most of whom wore Lakers purple-and-gold. Fans screamed loudly when Russell was introduced, oohed and aahed when he drew a foul on his first possession, and even saluted him with an \"M-V-P\" chant. That chant, by the way, came 34 seconds into the game, and all he'd done to that point was make a free throw. Didn't matter. He's already won Laker fans over. \"To see some new faces, that was great,\" Russell said. Plenty of people thought the Lakers would use the No. 2 pick in the draft on Jahlil Okafor, the Duke center who seemed more than a little interested in taking a shot at becoming the next dominant big man to play in Los Angeles. But the Lakers went with Russell instead, and it won't surprise anyone if the one-and-done collegian from Ohio State is starting beside Bryant on opening night this season. One player will be going into his 20th year with the Lakers, the other will still be in his 20th year on Earth. \"I have a lot to learn,\" Russell said. He's a quick study. Just from one summer league game, he learned the NBA backcourt rule, and that ballwatching on defense basically ensures that you'll get beat every time. \"Guys go back door,\" he lamented. He also learned that trying to do too much keeps you from doing what your team wants. \"There's little things that you can do in college that you can't do in the pros,\" Russell said. The more time he spends in those NBA bright lights now, the better off he'll be when the season starts for real this fall. \"Everybody was trying to do more than what their job was,\" Russell said. \"I know I got caught up in trying to do somebody else's job a few times. It's something I'll learn from.\"",

Backstage, Chad Gable cuts a promo about how Jason Jordan has had numerous chances to pick him as a tag team partner but did not. Jordan then arrives, says he's ready to give it a chance, and shakes hands with Gable. Marcus Louis defeats Solomon Crowe by submission. The Vaudevillains defeat Enzo Amore and Big Cass in a No. 1 Contender's match for the NXT Tag Team Championship. Enzo and Cass set up for their finisher but English rolls up Cass for the pin.

The One Direction star has won the approval of non-profit organisation PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] after urging his fans to boycott the local SeaWorld while performing on stage in San Diego, California on Thursday night (09.07.15). The 21-year-old British heartthrob was captured on video, by concert-goer Maisie Williams, saying: \"Does anybody here like dolphins? Don't go to SeaWorld!\" Upon seeing the footage on Instagram, a spokesperson for the organisation told E! News they were \"pleased as punch\" with Harry's comments. PETA's Senior Vice President Lisa Lange added: \"It's no surprise that Harry Styles knows what young people care about--they love animals, and they hate businesses that hurt them, like SeaWorld's orca prisons do. PETA hopes that One Direction's devoted fans will join the thousands of people around the world who are calling on SeaWorld to retire the orcas to coastal sanctuaries.\" The charity is planning to send the 'Story of My Life' hitmaker a T-shirt printed with the words \"SeaWorld Kills,'\" as well as a box of dolphin-shaped vegan chocolates to show their gratitude. SeaWorld has frequently been criticised for the treatment of dolphins and orcas at their facilities across the US.",

The 29-year-old actress - who describes herself as gender fluid - was convinced she wanted to be male when she was younger so started acquiring funds for future procedures, even though she \"didn't really know\" much about what it would entail. Asked if she had ever considered transitioning, she said: \"Definitely when I was younger. \"I had this jar that I would collect dollars, in fact it was probably cents, so I had like 19 cents to go towards this surgery that I didn't really know a lot about. \"I think I'd seen a daytime documentary, probably on Oprah or something. \"I started saving probably from the age of like five and when I got to 15, that's when I got more into my body and I shaved my head and my mum was just like, 'I don't know what's going on right now, but if you are happy then do it'.\" However, the 'Orange Is The New Black' star - who came out as a lesbian at 12 years old and is now engaged to designer Phoebe Dahl - eventually realised she didn't actually want to change genders but wanted to be more comfortable with herself. She added to 'Access Hollywood': \"I started to change the way that I dressed and talked and I realised that I didn't want to transition and I just wanted to be more comfortable in my own skin.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Huawei’s Honor 6 Plus was launched in 2014 Huawei has recently announced the Honor 7 flagship smartphone, which it officially introduced only in its home court China. But last year’s Honor 6 lineup, which includes two models, continues to be a viable alternative for those who don’t mind picking up a previous-generation model. Actually, the higher-end Honor 6 Plus remains quite relevant to this day because it still bundles good enough specs, which we will be detailing in what follows. The handset doesn’t sell in the US, but it’s available in Europe, where customers can pick it up for an affordable price. And as we will soon reveal in our review, Huawei's Honor 6 Plus is quite a good deal, and it would be a very good choice especially for those who are into smartphone photography. Design - iPhone-inspired look The Honor 6 Plus is the larger sibling of the Honor 6 flagship, coming with a spacious 5.5-inch display. The rising trend for device manufacturers as of late seems to be to release a base model and a Plus version as a combo. We’ve seen Apple doing it, and other device makers like Xiaomi have followed the same path. Looking at the Honor 6 Plus, you’ll quickly get a distinct iPhone vibe, as the device can be best described as an oversized version of the iPhone 4. As for materials used for its construction, the Honor 6 Plus employs a metal trim around the edge (the Honor 6 uses a plastic frame) and a glass black. The bottom of the phone features gentle curves that are quite reminiscent of the Sony Xperia Z3. Albeit being quite big, the Honor 6 Plus is pretty light, breaking the scales at 165 g and boasting a thickness of 7.5mm. However, you will need to use both hands to type on it properly, especially if you’re not endowed with a large grip. Due to the shiny surface, the phone can feel quite slippery at times, so be careful to always firmly hold it in hand. The volume rocker and power/standby button live on the upper right side, while a bit lower we have the dual SIM card slot. The top edge is home to the headphone jack, along with an IR blaster. There’s an odd configuration aspect here, in the sense that the second nanoSIM card slot also takes in the microSD card, for those who feel the need for extra storage on their phone. Display and camera performance - you’ll love snapping photographs The Huawei Honor 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display with 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution and 400 ppi pixel density. Huawei is a firm believer that QHD displays are useless and tend to unnecessarily suck out the battery life. So even with its latest P8 and Honor 7 flagships, the company has stuck with the 1080p standard. The Honor 6 Plus has the same size and resolution as the iPhone 6 Plus, so the two phones’ displays are pretty similar. Small text positioned beneath icons is pretty sharp and easy to read, and images look pretty sharp on the display. As for the camera department, this is one of the Honor 6 Plus’ strong points. On the back of the device live two 8MP cameras (a dual-camera setup): one is used to take regular shots, while the second adds some interesting depth of field effects and also lets you refocus an image after you’ve taken it. But while the images look great on the phone’s display, when you move the results onto your laptop and try to zoom on them, you’ll notice that there’s a lack of clarity. The camera setup performs quite decently in low-light environments, but without applying the Super night mode available in the camera app settings, the results prove to be quite grainy. Normally, you’ll be getting the best results in natural daylight environments, although sometime you can spot some barrel distortion. The dual camera setup can be used in concert with Wide-aperture mode, which lets users manually adjust the aperture from f/0.95 to f/16. To get the best results, you’d better make sure that the subject and background are well-defined. This creates nice imagery, as you can see for yourself in the gallery below. Still, it should be pointed out that the shooter does seem to have a little problem with over-exposing whites. The camera app offers features such as Beauty, Panorama or HDR, and you can also choose to add a Watermark to your photography. The shooter can also capture 1080p video, but the Honor 6 Plus doesn’t bundle optical image stabilization, so the result turned out be quite shaky in our test. As for the front-facing camera, which is of the 8MP variety, it takes pretty nice selfies. The conclusion is that the Honor 6 Plus is pretty capable of producing drool-worthy pictures for Facebook or Instagram, but you shouldn’t count on it if you want really detailed imagery. Power and performance - it can handle most of the things you throw at it The Honor 6 Plus is powered by one of Huawei’s homegrown octa-core Kirin 925 chipsets, which utilizes four low-power processing cores for everyday tasks and four chunkier cores for more intensive activities. The smartphone does perform quite well no matter the task you assign it. Even demanding games like Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 run on the handset without too many hiccups. The phone scored 43,869 points in AnTuTu, outshining 2014 handsets like the One M8 and Galaxy S5. But this result is no match for 2015’s flagships. For example, Samsung’s recent Galaxy S6 edge managed to score 69K points in the same benchmarking test. Audio quality during calls proved to be quite good, but sometimes we experienced call drops in areas where there is a continuous signal strength problem. Moreover, even if the phone can handle pretty much anything, it does tend to get quite hot. For example, after running the AnTuTu benchmarking tests, the phone was not so comfortable to hold in your hands. Also, if you happen to be on a trip in a new city like we were, and you wonder around with the camera always pointing at something, the phone would again start to get very hot. Another negative point we’d like to highlight is the low quality of the sound via the loudspeaker located on the back of the device. Menu and software - Only Android 4.4.2 KitKat on board While the Android 5.1 Lollipop update has been pushed on numerous devices, the Huawei Honor 6 Plus is still stuck at Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Huawei is notoriously slow in pushing updates, so at this point, maybe the company will roll out Android M directly for the handset. We’re keeping our fingers crossed for this to happen. Huawei has loaded its Emotion UI 3.0 skin on top, which doesn’t have an app drawer. The default icons feature rounded edges, but obviously, you can change this theme if that’s what you want. Among the proprietary apps that come pre-installed on the phone, you’ll find Phone Manager, which features menus such as phone accelerator, harassment filter, power saving, traffic manager, notification manager, app lock, and so on. The Tool folder is home to a host of utility apps, including Mirror, Magnifier, Torch, Notepad, Recorder, FM Radio, Backup, and more. With the Themes app, users are allowed to customize fonts, wallpaper, lock transition, screen, home wallpaper, and basically make their own custom theme. Sliding your finger at the bottom of the screen conjures a slider at the base, which, when pulled up, offers you quick access to weather, voice recording, calculator, torch, and camera app. Sliding your finger at the top of the display reveals two sections: Notifications and Shortcuts. Shortcuts gives you quick access to things like Bluetooth, Brightness adjustment, auto-rotate, settings and several others. The Settings department is filled with a long host of features and functionalities. For example, you can arrange for the screen to be turned on when double touching it. The Navigation bar is also customizable, so you can choose the combination of navigation buttons that suits you best. EMUI includes a Suspend button that sticks to the edges of the display and replicates the navigation bar on a half-wheel. There’s also a One-hand UI model that shrinks up the keyboard, navigation bar and phone UI, and sends it off packing to the corner of the screen. A long press on the square-shaped menu button will bring up recent apps you have used, which can be easily swiped off to shut them or pulled down upon and released to lock them. The Huawei 6 Plus also features notification LEDs that flicker every time you receive something, and you can customize their colors at will. Battery life - better than most As we told you above, Huawei doesn’t particularly like QHD displays because they suck out the phone’s battery life. So it sticks with FHD screens instead. And in some scenarios, this choice actually makes sense. The Honor 6 Plus houses a 3,600 mAh battery which is a lot better than what other handsets on the market have nowadays. The 5.1-inch Galaxy S6 only has a 2,250 mAh battery instead. For example, you will be able to go about taking pictures all day long and the battery won’t disappoint you. You can also spend most of your day using WhatsApp or other social media apps without worries. A 2-hour intense video streaming session would deplete the battery’s resources, leaving it at around 70%, which is not bad, but not exceptionally good either. However, the Honor 6 Plus impresses in standby mode. It can go on to survive 2 to 3 days if its display is not used. Which is pretty handy if you’re up on the mountain somewhere. We should also mention that this Huawei smartphone comes with an Ultra saving mode, which only keeps basic call and message functions available. There’s also a Smart mode that automatically adjust the CPU and network usage in order to balance performance. Connectivity - you know, all the usual good stuff The Huawei Honor 6 Plus features NFC, TD/FDD-LTE Cat 6 and dual-SIM cards, as we mentioned above. On top of that, there’s an infrared transmitter that allows your phone to be turned into a remote control for your TV, Hi-Fi system, or even air conditioning.

CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (82 Images) The Good. The Huawei Honor 6 Plus is a sleek device that looks and feels quite premium, although there’s a lot of room for improvement. Its octa-core processor is capable of maintaining of sustaining all operations that have to be performed and Huawei’s custom skin for Android is bundled with a bunch of nifty features. The price range of the device is also very affordable considering the specifications. OppoMart is selling the handset for $359. Most importantly, smartphone photography enthusiasts will absolutely love the handset that comes equipped with a dual-camera setup capable of a few neat tricks. The Bad. First off, the Huawei Honor 6 Plus is still stuck at Android 4.4.2 KitKat and with Android M around the corner this is pretty disappointing. Furthermore, the phone doesn’t have an app drawer which might seem counterintuitive to some. Also navigating through the custom interface proves to be quite cluttered and not so smooth to navigate. Conclusion. The phone offers a good value for its specs and given the amount of time we spend on Facebook and Instagram these days, the Honor 6 Plus should be quite a treat for people who love to snap photographs all day every day. Still the fact that Huawei hasn’t bother to update some of its higher-end handsets to the latest Android software, when the rest of the tech world is already there, it’s a pretty big downside. Also Huawei should probably stop trying to copy the iPhone design and focus on coming up with its own innovative look to better match the caliber of its handsets.",

The upgrade allows users to quickly edit titles or rename files straight from the overflow menu. This changes the past system of editing the document's title solely by saving. In the new version, users can simply edit titles for documents, spreadsheets and slide presentations in the text-entry field displayed by the overflow menu on the top right corner of the UI. To start editing, users should first slide the menu in from the right. Next, they should be able to tap the area that reads \"TestDoc.docx\" or any file that is currently open. A dialog box will then appear on the far right, which will allow the user to edit. Not only has the whole process become more simplified, but it has also made the menu look better than before. In terms of the Slides app, users can now do some layout changes to an existing slide by replacing it with one of several premade layouts that Google has stored within the app. Since the apps are accessed on a mobile device, Google believes that the new layout feature will make it easier for users to customize their layouts with improved access and speed. Another notable change is the enhanced collaboration feature within the Docs app, which can come in handy for those who often use Office Compatibility Mode on their devices. Users can now reply to comments when they are working and can also view comments and suggestions easily as these are now grouped together and not separately.

    "DiffbotBody": "'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By The Associated Press Tuesday, July 7, 2015, 9:00 p.m. I love grilling vegetables because doing so concentrates their natural sugars and amps up their flavor. During the summer, the usual suspects are zucchini, eggplant, onions, peppers and corn. They're all delicious this way and — Bonus! — they all become tender in an agreeably short amount of time. But it recently occurred to me that a number of the veggies I love roasting in the oven — broccoli, cauliflower and carrots — might also shine if cooked on the grill. Turns out, they do! The first problem was to figure out how to cut these vegetables so they wouldn't fall through the slats of the grill grates. The solution was to keep them in big pieces; I cut the carrots in half lengthwise, left the broccoli attached at the stalk, and sliced the cauliflower head straight down into half-inch cutlets (or “steaks”). These precautions kept the vegetables from falling into the flames, which allowed me to discover that it took forever for them to become tender. To speed up the process, I started by blanching them. After this quick bath in boiling water, I popped the vegetables in ice water to stop the cooking, then made sure they were dry before oiling, seasoning and grilling. Suddenly, these guys took no time at all to get tender. And they browned nicely along the way. Yay! Also, sure enough, their flavor became concentrated, just as it does when roasted. Indeed, it was assertive enough to pair up with a tahini sauce and spicy panko crumbs. When the vegetables are this robust, you may even decide you don't need the grilled steak. Chef Sara Moulton writes this column for the Associated Press. Grilled Vegetables With Tahini Sauce and Spicy Panko Start to finish: 1 hour 1⁄4 cup tahini, well stirred 2 1⁄2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons water, plus more if needed for sauce 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt 1⁄2 cup panko bread crumbs 1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper Water for cooking and cooling vegetables Ice 1 head broccoli, quartered down the center 1 small head cauliflower, sliced into 1⁄2-inch-thick “steaks” 6 large carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise Vegetable or canola oil, for brushing the vegetables Freshly ground black pepper In a medium bowl, stir together the tahini, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the water, lemon juice, garlic and 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt. Add additional water if necessary to achieve a pourable consistency. Set aside. In a large skillet over medium, heat the remaining 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the crushed red pepper and a hefty pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until the bread crumbs turn golden, for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Heat a grill to medium. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice and water and place it next to the pot. Add the broccoli and cook it for 2 minutes. Use tongs to remove the broccoli from the water and place it in the ice water. Cool it completely, then pat dry with paper towels. Repeat this process with the cauliflower and carrots, cooking the cauliflower for 2 minutes and the carrots for 3 minutes. Brush all of the vegetables well on both sides with vegetable oil. Season with salt and pepper and, working in batches if necessary, grill them on direct medium heat, with the grill covered, until they have distinct grill marks on the bottom, for about 5 minutes. Turn them over and grill on the second side until they have distinct grill marks on the second side and are tender, for about another 5 minutes. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, drizzle with the tahini sauce and sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.

    "DiffbotBody": "The controversial businessman and sometime pop star Bernard Tapie is suing the French state for more than €1bn he said was lost when Crédit Lyonnais, a now-defunct public bank, undervalued his stake in the sports clothing company Adidas. The former football team owner won €403m in 2008 after his case against the bank was sent to an arbitration panel – a move given the green light by IMF chief Christine Lagarde, who was then France’s Minister of Finance. But investigating judges called that ruling a “sham” after it was revealed one of Mr Tapie’s lawyers had links to one of the judges, and a Paris court annulled the decision in February. Mr Tapie is now taking his battle to a civil court where he is hopeful of being awarded more than double the sum originally ordered. His case against the Consortium de réalisation (CDR), the public body created to manage Crédit Lyonnais after it went bust in 1995, will get under way in September, with a decision expected by the end of the year. Mr Tapie’s lawyer Emmanuel Gaillard told The Independent that his legal team was confident of a victory after it uncovered new evidence showing that, immediately prior to the sale, Crédit Lyonnais was looking for somewhere to park shares, before buying them back and making a profit. This, he alleges, shows that the bank was actively devaluing Bernard Tapie’s shares in Adidas. “Whether or not you like Mr Tapie,” he added, “it is my personal belief that he has been massively defrauded.” But William Bourdon the lawyer representing CDR said Mr Gaillard “hasn’t found anything”. “The more difficult a situation Mr Tapie finds himself in, the more he gets into a logic of exaggeration and twists the facts.” The “revelation” of new evidence is the latest twist in a saga that has previously threatened to embroil the former President Nicolas Sarkozy’s rebranded Républicains party . A judicial investigation launched in 2012 to look into the decision to resort to an arbitration panel is currently trying to determine whether Mr Tapie’s connections to Mr Sarkozy and his entourage played a role. The investigation was not Mr Tapie’s first brush with justice. He served eight months in prison in 1995 after being convicted of bribing opposition players to let his football team, Olympique deMarseille, win a French League cup game in the 1990s. He did however lead the team to victory in four French Championships as its owner between 1986 and 1994, while his cycling team won the Tour de France twice. His varied career has taken him from newspaper owner, to pop singer to TV presenter – and by the time he sold his Adidas stake in 1993 in order to join President Mitterrand’s socialist cabinet he was France’s 20th richest man. He later defected to Sarkozy’s centre-right UMP party, supporting his presidential campaign in 2007 and meeting him six times between January and April 2007. Le Monde reported on 9 July that Mr Tapie had told the judge Serge Tournaire on 10 March: “Would this arbitration have happened without Nicholas Sarkozy’s agreement? The answer is no.” But another of his lawyers, Hervé Temime, told AFP that Mr Tapie “confirmed the meetings he had with Sarkozy” and that “they had nothing at all to do with the arbitration proceedings”.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Grapes around the North Coast are slowly turning color as a precursor to this year’s harvest, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual and deliver a smaller crop than last year. Vineyard managers in Sonoma and Napa counties report that they have seen signs of veraison — the French term for the onset of the visual signs of ripening in grapes. During the process, which begins the countdown to harvest, red grapes turn from green to red and a purplish hue while white grapes go from green to a golden yellow. Local farmers said this year’s crop is maturing anywhere from 10 days to two weeks earlier than typical, similar to last year’s timeline, which resulted in the earliest harvest on the North Coast in a decade. Harvest is on track to start in mid-August, though fruit destined for sparkling wines will begin coming off the vines in late July or early August. In fact, growers feared harvest would occur even sooner this year following a mild winter that triggered an unusually early bud break, when the vineyards awaken from their winter slumber. Most vines finished bud break in February, more than a month earlier than normal. However, cool weather in May slowed down flowering and fruit set, when small flowers on the vines are fertilized and transformed into tiny grapes. Typically, this stage can last from 10 to 14 days. This year, it stretched out as long as four weeks in some cases, growers said. As a result, growers expect the size of the Sonoma County grape crop will decline for the second straight year from the record-breaking 2013 harvest. Last year, growers hauled in 255,635 tons of grapes, valued at $593 million. “We saw a long bloom because of a cool May,” said Ryan Decker, wine grower relations manager for Rodney Strong Vineyards in Healdsburg. “The main effect is you will see a reduced berry set, which is going to reduce yield a little bit, which is what we are seeing. … It’s just a little under the long-term average.” Barry Hoffner, owner of Silverwood Ranch in the Pine Mountain/Cloverdale Peak area that borders Sonoma and Mendocino counties, thinks his crop will be 15 to 20 percent smaller than last year on the 40 acres of mountain vineyards he owns and leases. “I don’t think it is going to affect the quality,” Hoffner said. Growers are monitoring their grapes to spot signs of unevenness among fruit that is ripening slower than other clusters because of the long flowering period, likely forcing them to thin some of the crop this year. comments powered by Disqus",
    "LabBody": "Grapes around the North Coast are slowly turning color as a precursor to this year’s harvest, which is expected to arrive earlier than usual and deliver a smaller crop than last year. Vineyard managers in Sonoma and Napa counties report that they have seen signs of veraison — the French term for the onset of the visual signs of ripening in grapes. During the process, which begins the countdown to harvest, red grapes turn from green to red and a purplish hue while white grapes go from green to a golden yellow. Local farmers said this year’s crop is maturing anywhere from 10 days to two weeks earlier than typical, similar to last year’s timeline, which resulted in the earliest harvest on the North Coast in a decade. Harvest is on track to start in mid-August, though fruit destined for sparkling wines will begin coming off the vines in late July or early August. In fact, growers feared harvest would occur even sooner this year following a mild winter that triggered an unusually early bud break, when the vineyards awaken from their winter slumber. Most vines finished bud break in February, more than a month earlier than normal. However, cool weather in May slowed down flowering and fruit set, when small flowers on the vines are fertilized and transformed into tiny grapes. Typically, this stage can last from 10 to 14 days. This year, it stretched out as long as four weeks in some cases, growers said. As a result, growers expect the size of the Sonoma County grape crop will decline for the second straight year from the record-breaking 2013 harvest. Last year, growers hauled in 255,635 tons of grapes, valued at $593 million. “We saw a long bloom because of a cool May,” said Ryan Decker, wine grower relations manager for Rodney Strong Vineyards in Healdsburg. “The main effect is you will see a reduced berry set, which is going to reduce yield a little bit, which is what we are seeing. … It’s just a little under the long-term average.” Barry Hoffner, owner of Silverwood Ranch in the Pine Mountain/Cloverdale Peak area that borders Sonoma and Mendocino counties, thinks his crop will be 15 to 20 percent smaller than last year on the 40 acres of mountain vineyards he owns and leases. “I don’t think it is going to affect the quality,” Hoffner said. Growers are monitoring their grapes to spot signs of unevenness among fruit that is ripening slower than other clusters because of the long flowering period, likely forcing them to thin some of the crop this year. “Our primary goal is uniformity,” said P.J. Alviso, director of estate viticulture at Duckhorn Wine Co., which has 600 acres on the North Coast from the Napa Valley to the Russian River Valley. In some cases, Decker noted, it may be worth picking some less-ripe fruit if it is on a vine that contains other clusters that are more advanced, as the flavors could balance each other out. Growers have been lucky this year with temperate weather so far, especially because there have not been many heat spikes this summer. As a result, growers have been able to reduce the amount of water they normally use to irrigate vineyards. The amount of water used by the wine industry has come under increasing scrutiny with California in its fourth year of drought. This week’s rains also will help. Hoffner said they would allow him to hold off watering some of his vines until August. At Rodney Strong, Decker said, workers are only using only 4-6 gallons of water per vine on a weekly basis as opposed to the average of 8-10 gallons. The company has about 1,150 acres. The wine company has adopted new technology to help it reduce its water consumption, using a device that measures “evapotranspiration,” which is essentially the amount of moisture released by the vines into the air. That device, combined with soil moisture monitors, allows Decker and his crew to keep tabs on how much water to apply. “It gives us (in) gallons of water how much each vine is using per week,” he said. “We have been tracking a little bit lower as far as water use because it has been a little bit cooler to this point.” Alviso agreed, noting that Duckhorn has been using roughly 4-8 gallons per vine. “I have been amazed how much moisture the vines had early in the season,” he said. “We have irrigated very minimally.” Both men said they anticipate the clusters of grapes will enjoy a longer “hang time” between veraison and harvest this year, giving the fruit greater depth and complexity. “Any time we can extend that window from veraison to harvest, the wine quality is always going to be better,” Decker said. Though the yield this year appears not to be as large as in 2014, which was part of three large consecutive harvests, it should be more near average, which will come as a relief for most vintners given the large supply of unsold wine on the bulk market. The Ciatti Co., a San Rafael wine broker, notes in its June update that the California bulk wine market remains sluggish, adding that “large volumes remain of both red and white varietals from the 2012 and 2013 vintages.” Steve Sangiacomo, a partner of Sangiacomo Family Vineyards, said it was “a little relief” to have a smaller yield, given there had been some anxiety among growers at the prospects of having a fourth consecutive large crop. “We want to find that happy medium,” he said.

While waiting for the government to live up to its promise of expanding connectivity, some enthusiasts have built their own local networks to communicate, share files and play games. At community centers, authorized by the Ministry of Culture, young people use their mobile devices to take advantage of the free Wi-Fi connectivity. Kevin, a visitor at one of the community centers, said even though the network doesn't have the highest speed and all, it's free. \"You can get on the Internet, most of the time,” he said. Only a limited number of Cuban citizens have private Internet connections, which are not cheap. Foreigners can use the Internet at hotels, also at steep prices. The government’s promises of greater connectivity remain unfulfilled. Local networks But private citizens do own computers and some of them are forming local networks to experiment, connect and socialize. Marlon, a computer enthusiast, said in the absence of Internet connectivity, people have created forums — \"servers with games where people share with each other,\" exchange ideas, and debate topics like sports, culture and music. Cables usually run over the rooftops, in some cases connecting up to 10 people in the same neighborhood. “The 10th cable is the one which makes the connection to all the others,\" said Marlon. \"The 10th cable is connected to another switch, which is connected to another switch, and on and on. That is how the connection with other people is made.” Computer game enthusiasts Exchanging music and movies, and playing games do not attract the suspicion of the authorities, but discussions are another matter. “Everybody knows that we are being watched and they can be very picky and jumpy because nobody wants to lose their investment,\" said Adrian, a computer nethusiast. \" Nobody wants to lose their entertainment, the only alternative they have, and ... well, it's a complicated matter.” Knowing that computer game enthusiasts in other countries play tournaments with distant fellow gamers, young Cubans hope that someday they, too, will be able to play over the Internet. Marlon said they don't necessarily have to do that with the United States, but any other country. \"But to do that,\" he added, \"this local connection that we have must be turned into the Internet.” Unfortunately, the Cuban government’s fear of the free flow of information may hamper their wishes for some time.",

Music not only creates a soundtrack for the summer, but it can also be part of your summer reading list. Find these books and more at your local branch or omahalibrary.org. Kelsey Schwenker, library aide at the Millard Library, suggests a book that features a music student whose summer job turns out to be dangerously deceptive. “City of Dark Magic” by Magnus Flyte. This novel involves the mysterious city of Prague, a music student helping to catalog Beethoven’s manuscripts and the suicide (or possible murder) of her mentor. With intrigue, romance and music. What more could you want? Aura Sewell, library specialist at the Abrahams Library, listens to music in a new way thanks to her pick. “Bug Music: How Insects Gave Us Rhythm and Noise” by David Rothenberg. You don’t need to be a bug or music expert to enjoy “Bug Music.” The author’s passion for the topic is contagious. I never realized how many sounds I have been ignoring. Mark Sorensen, library specialist at W. Dale Clark Library, recommends books that explore connections made through music. “The Hum and the Shiver” by Alex Bledsoe. Pvt. Bronwyn Hyatt returns home from Iraq to the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee wounded in body and mind. She’s lost her connection to the songs of her kinfolk and gained a spectral “haint” that warns of tragedy to come. This is a totally unique contemporary fantasy — a love song to Appalachian music and folklore, richly layered, sexy, with a touch of the supernatural dancing just under the mandolin strings. “Bel Canto” by Ann Patchett. A world-class operatic diva, a Japanese millionaire, a youthful translator and a rebel soldier are thrown together in a South American villa when a coup attempt becomes a protracted hostage crisis. Dreamlike, hilarious and heartbreaking, this novel explores the power of music to unite us across languages and battle lines. Patchett modeled the heroine on soprano Renee Fleming. Read along with an album of her singing to complete the experience. Copyright ©2015 Omaha World-Herald. All rights reserved.

While there are certainly pros to a job that immerses you in the lives of the rich and powerful, it can also reveal the ugly side of humanity. Assistants see everything — from their employer’s daily schedule to their most intimate moments. It can feel like a roller coaster, with a boss acting like a demon from hell one minute and gifting their assistant an expensive bag the next. Bosses everywhere have their quirks, but a town like Los Angeles — with its abundance of celebrities and moguls — can breed a particularly terrifying species. Being an assistant might as well earn you a degree in the psychology of human behavior. And while some former assistants would prefer to leave their traumatizing employment experience in the past, there are the ones who have felt scorned enough to write a juicy memoir. Read on for seven scary stories from former assistants with bosses from hell, from a germaphobe actress to a Miranda Priestly wannabe. If you’ve ever been the assistant to an eccentric executive or crazy celebrity, find comfort in knowing that you’re not alone.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Publishers are turning to the hard paywall model in part because mobile news consumption has significantly increased in recent years and online advertising revenue has primarily been consumed by Facebook, Google, and Twitter. In 2012, I began my blog with a couple of posts on paywalls. In these posts, I tried to extract what I called paywall principles – theories that could help media companies decide what kind of paywalls to institute and when to institute them. (You can read about it here.) In one of these two paywall principles, I staked a claim that the metered model was the only sensible paywall model. I proposed that, as long as a newspaper Web site has a small proportion of readers accounting for a large proportion of articles read, and a sizeable proportion of its advertising inventory unsold, it could adopt the metered model without any sizeable impact in its unique visitors and advertising revenue. Recent history has, however, not been too kind to me. The Times UK has had success of its hard paywall model with more than 170,000 subscriptions, each paying £26 per month. Recently, the Financial Times moved from the metered model, which it pioneered, to a harder paywall (albeit with a one-month trial offer for US$1). So what is happening? Is it the beginning of the end for the metered model? What lies behind the sudden resurgence of the hard paywall? To better understand this, we need to keep in mind two broad trends. First, more and more of Internet (and news) consumption is now moving to mobile. Mary Meeker’s recent Internet Trends Report states that 22% of all Internet traffic in United States (65% for India!) is via mobile devices. And this number is growing. For 2014, The New York Times saw 28 million unique visitors to its Web site via mobile devices, nearly matching 31 million desktop visitors. Is it any wonder that, as an experiment, NYT recently barred its employees from accessing the home page via desktops, forcing them to access it via mobile and tablets, to empathise with consumers interacting with the site? However, mobile is harder to monetise for publishers. The smaller screen and the nature of interaction means that very different types of advertisement units and servings succeed. Also, developing and serving these typically requires access to a huge volume of visits and interactions and the ability to invest in people and systems that can leverage and analyse that data, thereby benefitting larger platform owners such as Facebook and Twitter, as opposed to publishers. Is it any surprise that two players, Google and Facebook, control as much as two-thirds of the global mobile ad market? Secondly, online display ads, which is where publishers compete, is now cornered largely by the bigger Internet players such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Between them, the three control more than 50% of the U.S. online display ad market. In the past, smaller publishers could offer targeted and more personalised audiences (business media). Today, social media is able to offer similar targeted and even better personalised ad opportunities. Additionally, the arrival of Facebook and Twitter has resulted in a considerable supply of inventory, thus lowering CPMs for publishers. Media owners, even with as high as 10 million to 20 million unique visitors per month, do not get the volume of ads or the kind of yield they would like. They are beginning to end up with more and more low-yield ads (typically programmatic). All media owners are effectively niche publishers on the Internet! The above explains why a hard paywall model is beginning to make sense for news media. In the absence of scale, with even 20 million unique visitors not considered meaningful enough, it makes sense for news media companies to approach online ad sales the way premium publishers do. By that, I mean sell not so much on reach (eyeballs) as on engagement (time spent). This is corroborated by Financial Times’ experience and rethinking of its strategy. Therefore, unlike before, there is really no incentive to drive page views or uniques by allowing casual readers to bump up volume. Instead, it might be better to show engagement and time spent by loyal visitors to ask for higher rates from advertisers. And, hence, the lack of interest in protecting visitor numbers via a metered model. I do not expect many publishers to abandon the metered model and switch to the hard paywall. Both Financial Times and The Times have the advantage of strong brand names and a loyal reader base. Not too many publishers have similar advantages, but, clearly, I expect resistance to the hard paywall to reduce. And, for the the few who do have a strong franchise, it may not be a bad idea or time to reconsider the hard paywall. For news publishers, the plateauing of ad growth with a corresponding decline in ad yield will mean that they can: Focus on getting more and more subs revenue – more trial offers, lower-priced/specialist apps to get non-subscribers to pony up, partnerships with platforms such as Blendle (an innovative micro-payment platform that is called the iTunes of news), etc. Partner with the platforms. This explains why even NYT has not hesitated to partner with Facebook on its Facebook Instant Articles programme, or why publishers are lining up to partner with Apple News or even BuzzFeed’s distributed content play.

    "DiffbotBody": "They are, without doubt, magnifique monsieurs in their flying machines, but fierce debate raged about who was the most magnifique – and who had become the first pilot to complete a manned flight across the Channel in an electric plane. The multi-billion-pound Airbus Group insisted that its employee Didier Esteyne, 57, had claimed the record by landing at Calais in his battery-powered E-Fan plane. But others claimed it was the “petit poisson”, independent aviator Hugues Duval, who had snatched victory in his tiny, MC15E Cri-Cri, a home-made aircraft bearing a passing resemblance to an airborne Sinclair C5. The noisiest claim has been made for Mr Esteyne. At 10.51AM on 10 July, after a 36-minute flight from Lydd airfield, Kent, he was cheered into Calais by a crowd of hundreds, with Airbus’s own film crew capturing the moment from a helicopter. Airbus, rumoured to have ploughed millions into the E-Fan project, was ecstatic. This, said an Airbus spokesman, was a feat worthy of the legendary French aviator Louis Blériot, who in 1909 became the first person to cross the Channel in an aeroplane. Mr Esteyne, he said, was “the closest thing to a living legend”. Jean Botti, the company’s chief technical officer declared that “10 July 2015 will now join the list of famous days in aviation history”. There was just one problem. Mr Duval, in his 12ft 10in-long Cri-Cri, built by his father, had touched down at Calais at 7.40pm on 9 July, about 15 hours before Mr Esteyne. “It’s amusing isn’t it?” said Madame Anne Lavrand, the general manager of Electravia, the French company that supplied the motors for Mr Duval’s twin-engined plane. “You have the big company with lots of money, but who wins? The little fish.” She suspected that the French aviation authorities, had been reluctant to let Mr Duval take off – perhaps because he was embarking on a potentially hazardous journey over water in an aircraft with limited flying range. So possibly to avoid any potential problems with officialdom, the daring aviator fixed his little plane to the back of a bigger one, on which he piggy-backed until it had taken off and carried him above international waters. Then he and his Cri-Cri were released to fly alone. Mr Duval continued on to Dover, circling the town before crossing the entire width of the Channel to land at Calais. The cunning plan was, said Ms Lavrand, “in the spirit of Blériot. M Duval is cunning, dynamic, and ready to do anything for his passion for aviation.” But the initial lift from the other aircraft allowed Mr Esteyne’s supporters to claim Mr Duval’s flight was invalid. “For goodness’ sake,” said one, “if you got taken up high enough, you could just glide across the Channel. You’ve got to hand it to the guy for being mad enough to do what he did, but it ain’t a record. You have to take off from the ground.” Airbus issued a more magnanimous statement, saying: “We applaud the intrepid aviator Hugues Duval. “All efforts in electric flying [help to] support our goal to advance electric and hybrid flight.” There was, though, a highly significant caveat. Mr Duval, the statement insisted, “plays in his own category”. The aviation giant, it appears, was not conceding victory to the little fish.",

The lawsuit alleges that Air Canada and several large U.S. airlines conspired to limit capacity on their routes, in order to inflate airline ticket prices. The federal court claim filed on July 8 seeks approval for a class action lawsuit. Vancouver resident Richard Maynard names Air Canada, as well as Delta, American, United and Southwest airlines, and says: \"the Defendants ... participated in a conspiracy with each other to: fix, maintain, increase or control the price for the supply of tickets for air travel in the USA or between the USA and Canada.\" The lawsuit says the airlines \"had communications about their plans for adding new flights, routes and extra seats,\" and \"reached agreements to limit flying routes\" and \"passenger carrying capacity\" in order to require customers \"to pay illegal and artificially high prices for air travel.\" The suit also says airlines \"took steps to disguise meetings and communications in which they discussed the conspiracy.\" A proposed Vancouver class action alleges airlines \"took steps to disguise meetings and communications in which they discussed the conspiracy.\" (CBC) Maynard's proposed class-action, if certified, would represent any Canadian who flew to or within the United States on the five major airlines listed in the past two years. Maynard, a professional Vancouver riding instructor, travels extensively throughout North America for horse shows, coaching and purchasing horses. He's bringing airline tickets he bought between 2010 and 2014 as evidence. Similar U.S. civil anti-trust action In a written statement to CBC, Air Canada says it is has not been advised of any legal proceedings and has no comment, but always complies with competition laws, whether in Canada, United States or elsewhere. None of the allegations has been proven in court. The Canadian suit follows a similar U.S. civil anti-trust action launched last week. That suit alleges that Delta, American, United and Southwest airlines conspired to price fix by signalling to one another how quickly they would add new flights, routes, extra seats and by limiting access to competitive fare information. The American anti-trust action alleges the airlines used a code word amongst themselves. It says the word \"discipline\" was used as \"a euphemism for limiting flights and seats, higher prices and fatter profit margins.\" Earlier this year a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into possible unlawful co-ordination among U.S. airlines was launched. \"Last year airlines had ... record profits, so I think competition authorities both in Canada and the United States may be more keen to look into consumer complaints like this case, \" University of British Columbia transportation professor Tae Oum told CBC News.",

Bella, who is in her first stage of the Paws of Freedom program, will someday fully graduate, too, and Gray looks forward to the day she'll be there to help him when he wakes from nightmares caused by post-traumatic stress. Bella's eyes — one brown, one blue — sparkle when inmate Toby Albritton, her trainer, reaches down to stroke her fur during the ceremony. The cute Catahoula-leopard and Dalmatian mix has lived with Albritton and her caretaker in the prison work camp throughout her training. Each dog is assigned two Tomoka inmates to train and care for them, living with the inmates at the work-camp dormitory. \"This program's been amazing,\" said Albritton, who is serving a 10-year sentence for battery and armed burglary and has been training Bella for just over 6 weeks. He says he's seen what a huge effect the dogs have on each inmate who gets involved. The program began in 2010 with just 13 dogs and has doubled in size as evidenced by Wednesday's ceremony. The Humane Society and the West Volusia Kennel Club partner with the state prison to help dogs like Bella become more adoptable, lessening the likelihood they'll languish at the shelter. Inmates at the prison spend about seven weeks training the dogs to sit, stay and obey his owner's commands. The partnership is meant to instill good citizenship in the animals as well as the inmates upon eventual release from the institution. Bella will be returning to the program for another seven-week training session to help Gray overcome his nightmares. When she gets finished with that additional training, she will be a service dog for Gray, who has experienced PTSD since his last tour of duty in the Middle East in 2001. Although all the trainers and caretakers wear prison blue, once visitors to the dogs' graduation get through the high security gates and into the graduation room at the work camp, the atmosphere no longer feels like a prison. Caretakers and trainers exude confidence, pride and beaming smiles that echo the dogs' demeanors. Inmate and caretaker Jeffery Ham describes the feelings that the program promotes. Ham, who cares for a furry charge named Sadie, says the program sends positive waves throughout the institution. Ham, who is serving a more than four-year sentence at the prison for possession and sale of cocaine, beams when he speaks about the animals. He says the good vibes spread to Tomoka prisoners outside the Pups program and that he gets as much out of the program as the fluffy critters. \"It makes you focused on somebody other than yourself,\" Ham says in a prison doorway decorated with red, white and blue — honoring the veterans that came to watch their new pups graduate. And that is exactly what Tomoka Correctional Institution Warden Terry Royal is attempting to accomplish with the program. \"If we're not trying to change lives, we're not doing anything for society,\" Royal says. The adoption, vaccination and other fees are waived for veterans like Gray who adopt the pups out of the Paws of Freedom subprogram, but for the dogs that haven't yet been adopted, more information can be found at prisonpupsandpals.org.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Ruling on the ACA is fair and well reasoned Published: Friday, June 26, 2015 at 1:00 a.m. Last Modified: Thursday, June 25, 2015 at 7:02 p.m. Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court became the third court to rule that the Affordable Care Act allows subsidies for health-insurance policies purchased through state or federal exchanges. The Supreme Court has the final say, of course. However, in light of criticism -- leveled by Justice Antonin Scalia, among others -- that the 6-3 ruling was \"absurd\" and overreaching, the lower court rulings suggest that the high court's strong majority provided reasoned jurisprudence. Some proponents of the ACA and its subsidies of private health-insurance policies for Americans who meet certain income criteria thought the Supreme Court should not have taken the case. A federal district court dismissed the lawsuit at issue -- King vs. Burwell -- and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has moderated after being one of the most conservative courts, upheld the act and the subsidy provisions. But there was value in the Supreme Court deciding this case. The act has been, and remains, controversial. Yesterday's ruling will not sway its political and ideological opponents, but it eliminates any doubt about the constitutionality of the subsidies -- whether or not the subsidized policies were bought in a state or federal exchange. What's more, both the high court majority and the appeals court determined that some language in the ACA was \"ambiguous,\" so a decision was in order. The high court assessed those provisions in the context of the entire legislation. The analysis in the majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. -- a conservative jurist nominated by former President George W. Bush -- was well reasoned and did not ignore the questions raised by the plaintiffs. The case was filed by four residents of Virginia which, like Florida, does not have a state exchange where uninsured people can purchase policies. The plaintiffs argued that Americans who meet the criteria for subsidies (based on income) should not receive them if their state doesn't have an exchange. In Virginia, Florida and other states, Americans have been able to obtain coverage through the federal exchange. The Internal Revenue Service determined that, based on the ACA, any qualified Americans should receive the subsidies -- regardless of the exchange they used. The plaintiffs cited a provision deep in the ACA's text that stated the subsidies, in the form of tax credits, were only available if the taxpayer enrolled in an insurance plan through \"an exchange established by the state.\" But, as Roberts made clear, other parts of the act call for the federal government to establish \"such exchange\" if the state government does not. Furthermore, based on numerous other provisions in the law, Roberts and the majority found it was \"implausible\" to conclude that Congress intended the subsidies to be available only to those using state-based exchanges. The opinion stated that the plaintiffs' \"plain-meaning arguments are strong, but the act's context and structure compel the conclusion that [the ACA] allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any exchange created under the act.\" As even supporters of the ACA and its goal of getting more Americans insured recognize, the law is complex and includes what Roberts referred to as \"inartful drafting.\" But, as the majority ruled, when a court is confronted with a challenge over such language, it can and should consider the context of those words in the entire legislation. The six justices in the majority did that, and reached a reasonable conclusion. The ruling will certainly benefit Floridians and residents of other states that for various reasons -- some good, some bad -- have not created exchanges. It would have been a travesty for residents of those states to be denied the benefits available to other Americans. As a result, the Supreme Court's sound ruling not only upholds the law but supports good, fair public policy. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

Fans, teammates, sports writers and broadcasters, team officials, university officials and people from all walks of life were touched by his death, and they all wanted to have their say. And just about everyone had something different to say, relating personal incidents with the guy known as “the Snake” that reveals a lot more than what he did as a football player for Alabama and Oakland. There is no way I can repeat all the stories that have been told, or even mention all the people who told them. They all are interesting. It would be great if someone could compile every article that has appeared on the Internet into a book. Actually, two books would be needed — one to tell the good and funny stuff, the other the bad and ugly. That's pretty much the way he lived. There was the football side — hard work, focused, productive and serious. Then he'd party just as hard during the night — often all night. He'd joke about wanting to do everything today (and tonight) because he might not be here tomorrow. He died at age 69, the same age as Coach Bryant, whom he played for at Alabama. Someone mentioned that both men had lived hard, and if you put Stabler's days and nights together, he'd be 150 or more. By now you probably have read what others have written, so there is no need for me to repeat. I'll try to take another approach, telling my story with a personal touch. It started Thursday afternoon when I received a message from The Times telling me Stabler had died and I needed to write something for Saturday's paper. That was a shocker. I've written too many stories about friends dying; I didn't feel I could do another. But writers write. “OK,” I replied. A couple of hours later, after reading a bunch of tributes on Facebook, I got another message from The Times. “Oops! He's not dead,” it read. Someone in Tuscaloosa had goofed. I felt a huge relief. Life was light and rosy. At least for a couple of hours. Then another message from the office: “This time for real. Cancer.” I tried to put my “game face” back on and come up with something to write that would not be written during the next day and a half before my column went to press. As I was thinking, a familiar phrase came to mind: “Relax, God will provide.” Suddenly, the phone rang. “Ken Meyer, here; just wanted to touch bases about Kenny Stabler dying,” he said. Meyer coached quarterbacks at Alabama during the four years Stabler played there. “Actually, he only played three years; freshmen were ineligible back then,” my old coaching friend said. “I was with them (Crimson Tide) in his (Stabler's) younger days — but it was during his entire college career. He was a guy who would make the big play for you. He wasn't an option quarterback, but he would still take that ball and get it all the way down field and score. He was a great passing quarterback, as you can see on the NFL highlight films.” Meyer remembers Stabler as a guy capable of doing what needed to be done when it needed to be done. He pointed out the “run in the mud” for the winning touchdown against Auburn in 1967 as an example of a passing quarterback running with the ball. “He'd make whatever play you needed,” Meyer said, pointing out others. No matter how good he was on the field, he could be a coach's nightmare off it. “He got into trouble with Coach Bryant, but you couldn't say much because when you needed him, he'd win for you,” Meyer said, downplaying the Snake's night life. I remember when he'd conduct his football camp at Marion Institute in the summer. He rented a house for sports writers who wanted to come down. We'd write and sleep in the daytime. Stabler would work his camp during the day and party in Montgomery at night, taking any of the writers who wanted to go with him. He was a race fan and would go to Daytona International Speedway. Don Naman would ask him to dinner with the Talladega crowd, then after we went back to the motel, Stabler would party, then join us for breakfast the next morning. There is a song, “Bad to the Bone” that's played with some of his highlight films, and at least one promotion proclaims he had “A rebel attitude that led a band of renegades to the Super Bowl Championship.” Someone has written of him, “Perfect Quarterback, Perfect Renegade.” It's a real shame that he was not inducted into the Football Hall of Fame before he died. He certainly earned it on the field, and his statistics are far better than any of several quarterbacks already inducted. In addition to his outstanding college career, he was the best football commentator, in my opinion, Alabama ever had on its broadcast team. I disapprove of a lot of the things the Snake did on the dark side of life, but there were few better when it came to public relations. I will remember him as friendly, kind, easy to talk with and always pleasant to his fans. He'd show up at all kinds of events, pose for pictures and sign autographs. My sister-in-law used to run into him at a grocery store in Foley, take pictures and get autographs. You've probably seen some of them on Facebook.

    "LabBody": "By JIMMY SMOTHERSSports Editor Emeritus There is no way I can repeat all the stories that have been told, or even mention all the people who told them. They all are interesting. It would be great if someone could compile every article that has appeared on the Internet into a book. Actually, two books would be needed — one to tell the good and funny stuff, the other the bad and ugly. That's pretty much the way he lived. There was the football side — hard work, focused, productive and serious. Then he'd party just as hard during the night — often all night. He'd joke about wanting to do everything today (and tonight) because he might not be here tomorrow. He died at age 69, the same age as Coach Bryant, whom he played for at Alabama. Someone mentioned that both men had lived hard, and if you put Stabler's days and nights together, he'd be 150 or more. By now you probably have read what others have written, so there is no need for me to repeat. I'll try to take another approach, telling my story with a personal touch. It started Thursday afternoon when I received a message from The Times telling me Stabler had died and I needed to write something for Saturday's paper. That was a shocker. I've written too many stories about friends dying; I didn't feel I could do another. But writers write. “OK,” I replied. A couple of hours later, after reading a bunch of tributes on Facebook, I got another message from The Times. “Oops! He's not dead,” it read. Someone in Tuscaloosa had goofed. I felt a huge relief. Life was light and rosy. At least for a couple of hours. Then another message from the office: “This time for real. Cancer.” I tried to put my “game face” back on and come up with something to write that would not be written during the next day and a half before my column went to press. As I was thinking, a familiar phrase came to mind: “Relax, God will provide.” Suddenly, the phone rang. “Ken Meyer, here; just wanted to touch bases about Kenny Stabler dying,” he said. Meyer coached quarterbacks at Alabama during the four years Stabler played there. “Actually, he only played three years; freshmen were ineligible back then,” my old coaching friend said. “I was with them (Crimson Tide) in his (Stabler's) younger days — but it was during his entire college career. He was a guy who would make the big play for you. He wasn't an option quarterback, but he would still take that ball and get it all the way down field and score. He was a great passing quarterback, as you can see on the NFL highlight films.” Meyer remembers Stabler as a guy capable of doing what needed to be done when it needed to be done. He pointed out the “run in the mud” for the winning touchdown against Auburn in 1967 as an example of a passing quarterback running with the ball. “He'd make whatever play you needed,” Meyer said, pointing out others. No matter how good he was on the field, he could be a coach's nightmare off it. “He got into trouble with Coach Bryant, but you couldn't say much because when you needed him, he'd win for you,” Meyer said, downplaying the Snake's night life. I remember when he'd conduct his football camp at Marion Institute in the summer. He rented a house for sports writers who wanted to come down. We'd write and sleep in the daytime. Stabler would work his camp during the day and party in Montgomery at night, taking any of the writers who wanted to go with him. He was a race fan and would go to Daytona International Speedway. Don Naman would ask him to dinner with the Talladega crowd, then after we went back to the motel, Stabler would party, then join us for breakfast the next morning. There is a song, “Bad to the Bone” that's played with some of his highlight films, and at least one promotion proclaims he had “A rebel attitude that led a band of renegades to the Super Bowl Championship.” Someone has written of him, “Perfect Quarterback, Perfect Renegade.” It's a real shame that he was not inducted into the Football Hall of Fame before he died. He certainly earned it on the field, and his statistics are far better than any of several quarterbacks already inducted. In addition to his outstanding college career, he was the best football commentator, in my opinion, Alabama ever had on its broadcast team. I disapprove of a lot of the things the Snake did on the dark side of life, but there were few better when it came to public relations. I will remember him as friendly, kind, easy to talk with and always pleasant to his fans. He'd show up at all kinds of events, pose for pictures and sign autographs. My sister-in-law used to run into him at a grocery store in Foley, take pictures and get autographs. You've probably seen some of them on Facebook.

    "LabBody": "An official said a construction company paid a fee to secure the rights to draw water from the city hydrant two years ago. It's unclear if Selleck or his employees bought the water from the company or another source. (Carlo Allegri/ Associated Press) Water from a public hydrant that Tom Selleck has been accused of stealing from in dry California was legally purchased, an official said. The Calleguas Municipal Water District in Ventura County sued the Magnum, P.I. star, alleging that a tanker truck filled up at the hydrant and took it to Selleck's 60-acre ranch more than a dozen times in the past two years. The district announced a tentative settlement with Selleck on Thursday. Jay Spurgin, public works director for Thousand Oaks, said a construction company paid a fee to secure the rights to draw water from the city hydrant two years ago. About 1.4 million gallons of water were taken from the hydrant during that period. \"There was water used during that time, and it was paid for,\" he said. Construction firms and contractors can obtain special meters that allow them to haul water from hydrants for large projects. Companies can draw as much water as they need or sell it to a third party as long as they pay the monthly service charge and water bill, Spurgin said. The water meter in question was removed in June. It's unclear if Selleck or his employees bought the water from the company or another source. A representative for Selleck didn't immediately return a request for comment on Friday. The water district said it spent nearly $22,000 US for a private detective to investigate. District officials declined to provide details of the tentative settlement, which has to be approved by the water board next week. California is grappling with a persistent drought, and the community where Selleck has his land is under mandatory cutbacks as high as 36 per cent.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The Southeast-based bank has been showing its sympathy for Obama's deportation relief. Without scholarships, Natasha Morales, a 21-year-old double major in math and chemistry at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, might never have had a chance for a higher education. She came to the United States at age 5 from Michoacan, Mexico, crossing the border with her mother without proper papers. As an undocumented immigrant, she wasn't eligible for federal financial aid for college, although she'd lived in North Carolina since kindergarten. The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

Why not share your impressions — and those of residents of foreign countries about the United States — with Trib readers in 150 words? The world's a big place. Bring it home with Letters Home. Contact Colin McNickle (412-320-7836 or cmcnickle@tribweb.com). 'American Coyotes' Series Traveling by Jeep, boat and foot, Tribune-Review investigative reporter Carl Prine and photojournalist Justin Merriman covered nearly 2,000 miles over two months along the border with Mexico to report on coyotes — the human traffickers who bring illegal immigrants into the United States. Most are Americans working for money and/or drugs. This series reports how their operations have a major impact on life for residents and the environment along the border — and beyond. By Jonah Goldberg Friday, July 10, 2015, 8:57 p.m. Poor Donald Trump. It wasn't supposed to be like this. For years, wherever The Donald went, he met people who told him he should run for president. His retinue of sycophants surely saw little to gain from explaining that “birthers,” celebrity worshippers and devotees of “The Apprentice” are not a statistically meaningful sample of the electorate. In the past, Trump always pulled back from the brink. Why risk his beloved TV show? Why endure the embarrassment of revealing he's not as rich as he pretends? Flirt but don't commit was the rule. But something changed. One too many Twitter followers said, “Do it!” One too many valets whispered, “America needs you” — probably just before asking for a raise. And Trump took the leap — though he hasn't provided the required financial disclosures yet, which inclines me to think that he will either suddenly find an excuse to retreat or that he has a team of accountants trying to figure out how he can simultaneously save face and avoid perjury. In his announcement speech — the brevity and discipline of which were impressive only by the standards of Fidel Castro or Joe Biden — Trump shouted his certainty that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals to America, but he could only “assume” (sotto voce) that “some” of those Mexicans are good people. Trump's commitment to the GOP has often been situational. Sure, he has put his money where his mouth is, but he's as promiscuous with his mouth as he is with the Trump brand. He's given money to Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Andrew Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and the Clinton Foundation. Asked to explain why, he said, “You're gonna need things from everybody.” (One does wonder what Trump hoped to get from the Clinton Foundation.) This attitude helps explain why Trump is such a fan of eminent domain. The man seeking the tea party's support loves to use the government to seize private land he can't — or doesn't want to — buy fairly. Given the fetid swamp of sanctioned corruption that passes for commerce in New York, it's no wonder he sees nothing wrong with greasing the skids by funding liberal politicians. The great irony is that the man who made his fortune playing the game of influence-peddling and celebrity-mongering forgot that the other players get a turn. Trump has lost his TV show. Macy's will no longer carry his menswear. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who governs like a banana republic demagogue, has declared that he is reviewing Trump's contracts with the city. Meanwhile, too many of Trump's GOP primary competitors, afraid of angering his fans, stand mute or mumbling. Republicans are fielding the best candidates in a generation, but Trump is poised to make them chumps by association. He has no chance of becoming president, but he has the huge potential to deny his alleged party a White House victory in 2016. And when that happens, he will of course stay a celebrity, but he will have traded his fame for infamy, even among those now cheering him on.

Subscribe Now Get the digital edition David Byrne, BB King, The Jam and Sly \u0026 The Family Stone all feature in the new issue of Uncut, dated August 2015: in UK shops now and also available digitally. The former Talking Heads mastermind is on the cover, and inside Byrne takes us through his long career, his work with Brian Eno and St Vincent, the Meltdown festival he’s curating in London this summer, and how he accidentally invented hip-hop. “There was this temptation to really get into the pop machine and take it to the next level of pop arenas,” Byrne says, recalling the late ’80s when Talking Heads began scoring significant hits, “and you start building up this huge infrastructure which you then have to write and record to support. “I sensed losing some freedom there, as regards what I can do; and I like too much being able to do all of those different sorts of things.” In honour of David Byrne, Uncut also count down the 50 greatest New York albums, featuring The Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Frank Sinatra, The Strokes and more. Uncut salutes BB King and examines whether the blues that the guitarist helped to invent is facing extinction itself. “Right now, the blues isn’t cool to the young,” Paul Puccioni tells us. On the eve of a major exhibition about The Jam, Paul Weller talks us through the rare exhibits on show, much of it collected by Weller’s own family. “I didn’t keep anything,” he admits cheerfully. “I used to destroy my notebooks after every record, burn them or rip them up. I was always scorched earth, almost ceremonial. It’s been and done.” Elsewhere, we investigate the early days of psych-funk genius Sly Stone, and the Family Stone, as a boxset of their epochal Fillmore East shows from 1968 emerges. “Sly Stone reinvented pop music in his own image,” says the Family Stone’s Cynthia Robinson. Merle Haggard answers your questions, and queries from famous fans, in our Audience With… feature this month. “I’m thankful for the life I’ve been given,” the Bakersfield Bard tells us. In an in-depth interview, Ezra Furman talks Lou Reed, protest music, self-harm and gender fluidity… “I’m gonna have unresolved issues until I’m dead,” he explains. Peter Perrett and the rest of The Only Ones recall the creation of their cosmic classic “Another Girl, Another Planet”, a story taking in charisma, double-drum feats and various addictions. “At the time, I was more addicted to sex…” says Perrett today. The Monkees take us through their career, album by album, from their self-titled debut, through mind-bending, psychedelic soundtrack Head, right up to 1996’s Justus. “We were essentially a garage band,” says Micky Dolenz. “Even on the television show, remember, we never made it… it was that struggle for success that was so important, and I think that’s what made it so endearing to so many kids around the world.” Elsewhere, The Supremes’ Mary Wilson details her life in records, we look at a new exhibition on The Kinks, examine the return of David Pearce and Flying Saucer Attack, and speak to Gordon Lightfoot about his “beneficial” emotional stress. In the reviews section, albums by Tame Impala, Jason Isbell, Sleaford Mods, Neil Young, Fraser A Gorman, Lloyd Cole, Miles Davis and The Dream Syndicate are all reviewed, along with gigs by Paul McCartney and Patti Smith, as well as films on The Damned, Wilko Johnson and Amy Winehouse. The free CD, The Name Of This Band Is…, includes songs from Jason Isbell, Sleaford Mods, Flying Saucer Attack, Ezra Furman, Sonny Vincent \u0026 Rocket From The Crypt, The Deslondes, Stewart Lee and Omar Souleyman.

Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Kurt Vile and John Lydon are all in the new issue of Uncut, dated October 2015 and out on August 25. McCartney is on the cover, and inside he discusses his old Beatles songwriting partner, John Lennon, George Harrison‘s “late blooming” talent, the upcoming reissues of his ’80s hits Tug Of War and Pipes Of Peace, and how he learned to “block the shit”. “When I think of John, I think of us writing together,” says McCartney. “‘A Day In The Life’… stuff like that.” Keith Richards talks about his new solo album, Crosseyed Heart, his first LP under his own name in 23 years, and the future – “I tell you this, I ain’t retiring,” he says. Ahead of the release of his new album, B’lieve I’m Goin’ Down…, Kurt Vile takes us through his career in albums, from God Is Saying This To You and The War On Drugs’ Wagonwheel Blues, to his own Smoke Ring For My Halo and his latest effort. Uncut also meet John Lydon, the self-proclaimed king of punk, at his Malibu home and discover that he’s matured with age. Subjects under discussion include a Sex Pistols perfume range, his thoughts on David Cameron’s Britain and just what he intends to do with his body after he dies – “It’s very easy to be bitter and twisted,” he confesses. Elsewhere, Dan Auerbach answers your questions on Akron, working with Dr John, stepping on Neil Young‘s foot and his new band, The Arcs. “We worked on The Black Keys every single day. Relentless. I treat music like it’s a job.” Mercury Rev discuss the making of their Deserter’s Songs highlight, “Opus 40″, inspired by the Catskill Mountains and energised by The Band‘s Levon Helm. We’re also in Los Angeles’ Echo Park for a trip with radical, mystical songwriter Julia Holter, and a look inside her fantastic new album, Have You In My Wilderness. We also chat to Squeeze cool cats Chris Difford, Glenn Tilbrook and co about their remarkable London story… involving both sweetshops and cop shops. In the reviews section, we look at new albums from Low, Keith Richards, New Order, Robert Forster, David Gilmour and Mercury Rev, archive releases from Queen, Link Wray and the Faces, and DVDs and films on Wilco, NWA and Alejandro Jodorowsky. Live, we catch gigs from Björk and The Sonics.

    "DiffbotBody": "(Newser) – A CDC study of almost 28,000 women has shown links between use of the antidepressants Paxil and Prozac and birth defects, Reuters reports. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, sought to answer long-debated questions about the effect of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, during pregnancy, and whether the entire class of drugs or only certain SSRIs presented a risk, the news agency notes. Off the hook (at least according to this study): Zoloft, Celexa, and Lexapro. In a survey, researchers asked the participants if they had taken any of those five antidepressants from one month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, then looked at women who ended up having children with birth defects. Only women who took Prozac (generic name fluoxetine) and Paxil (paroxetine) showed increased risk, with birth defects occurring 2 to 3.5 times more frequently than women who didn't take those drugs. Prozac was linked to a defect in which children's skulls were misshapen, while Paxil was associated with a defect in which the intestines poke outside the body, as well as missing parts of the brain and skull, the study notes; both were also tied to a heart defect. But the study's lead author tells NPR that the overall risk is still not huge (e.g., the risk for brain and skull malformation crept up from 2 to 7 out of 10,000 births when paroxetine was used), and she stresses the study only shows a link—it doesn't prove the meds actually caused the defects. Eli Lilly, which distributes Prozac, tells ABC News that it puts its drugs through rigorous evaluations and that Prozac is \"considered as having a positive benefit-risk profile for patients by regulatory authorities and physicians around the world.\" GlaxoSmithKline, which makes Paxil, says its warning labels tell doctors to warn patients about risks and \"that for some the benefits of therapy may continue to outweigh the potential risk.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "Former Florida point guard Teddy Dupay will attempt to break the record for most 3-pointers made in a 24-hour period. Matt Stamey/Staff photographer/File Published: Wednesday, July 8, 2015 at 11:21 p.m. Last Modified: Wednesday, July 8, 2015 at 11:21 p.m. Teddy Dupay made his mark at Florida for his ability to drain 3-point shots. But the former Gator guard who helped lead UF to the 2000 national title game is embarking on his toughest long-range shooting challenge yet. On July 15, at the Dream Center of Tampa Gym, Dupay will attempt to break the Guinness World Record for most 3-pointers in a 24-hour period. The record is 10,381, which was set in 2012 by 23-year old Dan Loriaux of Portland, Ore. According to a Portland Tribune article, Loriaux encountered problems with blisters and ligament damage in his elbow while hoisting 13,718 attempts. Still, Loriaux kept shooting at a 75.7 percent clip. To break Loriaux’s mark, Dupay would need to average 7.2 3-pointers made per minute. “Anything is possible,” Dupay said. “I’ve been training. I’m in great shape. I’m in the gym every day. I’m definitely prepared and somebody else did it so you don’t say it’s impossible. This is something where I’m going to have to shoot roughly 80 percent from the 3-point line for 24 hours to break the record and so we will see.” Dupay is attempting the record not for publicity, but to raise money for charity. A friend gave him the idea of trying for the record after watching the Today Show and seeing someone get interviewed for breaking the Guinness record for most pull-ups. “My knee-jerk reaction was no way, I’m old now,” said Dupay, who turned 36 on June 26. “I’m not a young kid anymore.” But Dupay decided if he could find a charity to benefit from the event, he’d give it a shot. That charity is the Academy Prep Center of Tampa and St. Petersburg, a tuition-free school for middle school-aged children that provides high-level education for need-based students. After visiting the school, Dupay was convinced it was the perfect charity for his mission to help kids. “I was so impressed with how the kids were communicating, the skills that were being taught,” Dupay said. “It’s an amazing education. We’re talking about chess, golf, public speaking, mock trials. The kids are getting real-life experience that they may be getting at a ($20,000 to $40,000) per year private school.” So Dupay is gathering sponsors to donate anywhere from a penny to a dime to a dollar per made shot. He’ll have a handful of celebrity observers during the event, including former Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive end Simeon Rice, WWE tag team champion and former UF defensive end Thaddeus Bullard (aka Titus O’Neil) and former Tampa Bay Storm owner Bob Gries. Dupay also has received support from longtime ESPN college basketball analyst Dick Vitale, who took to social media to air a video to promote Dupay’s attempt to break the record. Most Gator fans remember Dupay as “Teddy Trigger,” one of Billy Donovan’s first big-time recruits, an undersized 5-foot-10 guard who arrived at Florida in 1998 and helped transform the Gators into a nationally relevant program. As part of a deep and talented team that included Mike Miller, Matt Bonner, Udonis Haslem, Brent Wright and Major Parker, Florida made its second Final Four run in school history in 2000 and knocked off North Carolina before falling 89-76 to Michigan State in the title game. That turned out to be a high point of a college career in which Dupay suffered back problems and was forced to leave UF in 2001 amid allegations he gambled on sports. In 2009, a few years removed from his overseas basketball career, Dupay pleaded guilty to an assault charge in a domestic dispute. Dupay has tried to atone for his past by returning to the game he loves and cautioning others not to make the same mistakes he made. In 2014, Dupay opened the Teddy Dupay Basketball Academy in Tampa in an attempt to develop basketball at the grassroots level within the state. “I’m just trying to turn everything negatively that’s happened to me into a positive for someone else,” Dupay said.

    "DiffbotBody": "Raising a child is a challenge, and it’s exponentially harder when you’re doing it solo. Just ask Bay Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer and mother of three boys. In her book, “Bay and Her Boys: Unexpected Lessons I Learned as a (Single) Mom,” she writes about bringing up kids alone after her husband left when she was pregnant with their third child. Here, she offers parenting tips. They’re geared for single moms, but they’re equally applicable to two-parent families… So much is written and spoken that suggests single parents can’t succeed. Our children, they tell us, are more likely to be low achievers, suffer depression, abuse drugs and alcohol, be sexually promiscuous and drop out of school. There is more, but you get the point. The statistics are disturbing. But numbers don’t tell our story. We do. We are moms. We make the difference for our kids – we give them what they need to defy these odds. We write the story of our families and we do it with our lives. Single moms can succeed – and you must. It’s the most important job you’ll ever do, so put your heart, mind, and soul into it and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it. For the sake of your kids, reach deep inside yourself and find the strength, courage and tenacity to be the mom they need. The first step is to accept all the responsibility – and to hold yourself accountable to the task. Then give it everything you have. Change your life and make whatever sacrifices are needed to put your kids first in your life. I have eight rules for single moms. They work for all parents, but when you’re raising kids on your own, there’s no getting around any one of them. Every rule is essential. So commit yourself to the course, the whole course, and put your kids on the path to becoming the men and women they were meant to be.",

The first step is to accept all the responsibility – and to hold yourself accountable to the task. Then give it everything you have. Change your life and make whatever sacrifices are needed to put your kids first in your life. I have eight rules for single moms. They work for all parents, but when you’re raising kids on your own, there’s no getting around any one of them. Every rule is essential. So commit yourself to the course, the whole course, and put your kids on the path to becoming the men and women they were meant to be. Rule #1: Take Charge It doesn’t matter how you got here, how traumatic the trip has been, or how discouraged you are. What matters is that you are now a single mom. Walk away from that other life and leave the baggage behind. Throw yourself into the world of single parenting. It’s going to take every bit of your strength, energy and time to be the parent your kids need. Take charge of your life, so you can take charge of theirs. Their lives hinge on you getting it together. Yes, the responsibility is enormous, as is the challenge. But you can do it. Believe in yourself. Be strong. Be proud. Rule #2: Let Their Dad Be Their DadGive your kids every opportunity to have a close and healthy relationship with their father. It is unequivocally one of the most important things you can do for them. Kids know instinctively that their dad belongs in their life, and they desperately want him there. What’s more – they need him there. No matter what you think of him, do what is right for your kids. Never bad-mouth their dad. Don’t tell them anything that would make them think less of him or feel bad about him. But do tell them good things about him so they are comfortable openly loving him in their own home. Then do all in your power to see that they spend time with him. Right behind time with you, it’s the greatest gift you can give them. Ancillary to Rule #2: Compensate for the Lack of a Dad in the Home Kids learn so much and develop so well when they are raised in a loving two-parent family. You can’t give your children that – not now – but you can find good two-parent families and strong male role models and make them part of your kid’s world. Through their example these friends can give your children an understanding and appreciation of the indispensable role of husband and father – and teach them priceless lessons that come with this knowledge. Rule #3: Put Your Kids FirstHere’s the bottom line to raising kids as a single mom: The kids need you – your time, your energy, your heart, your guidance, your understanding, your discipline – they need all of you. Just being nearby doesn’t cut it. They have to know that they are the center of your world, that they can lean on you for strength, that you will never let them down. That kind of trust requires constant sacrifice. Forget about blocks of time for yourself and high-powered jobs; forget about dating and romantic getaways. Spend your evenings and weekends with your kids. Give them a deep sense of belonging that comes with being part of a strong family. Do whatever it takes to put your kids first in your life. Then keep them there. Rule #4: Strip Parenting Down to the Basics You’re one person with the job of two. It’s not easy, but you can do it. Strip parenting down to the basics. It’s the only way to know for certain that you’re focusing your time and energy on the important stuff. Cut expectations down to size. Throw overboard the high, unrealistic ideals of the past. Keep only what matters. Simplify, prioritize and chop until you find the right balance for your family. Scrap the nonessentials and give your kids what they need the most – time with you. Rule #5: Give Your Kids a Home to LoveThe home you give your kids is as important to them as the air they breathe and the food they eat. It needs be like a giant security blanket wrapped tightly around them, providing them with a powerful sense of belonging and a guaranteed refuge from the outside world. For kids to thrive, their home has to be where they feel the comfort and confidence that comes with being part of something bigger than themselves. They learn their home isn’t just where they live – it’s where they belong because it’s where their family lives. Give your kids a home to love – a family-centered, magical place where they live together with you, talking and laughing, playing and sharing, loving and caring. Put televisions, computers and game systems in a family room. Drive your kids out of their bedrooms and into family space. Time together is what makes families, and this happens in the home. It’s your job to see it happens in yours. Rule #6: Be Their Parent, Not Their Friend – Set Rules and Enforce Them Single moms have to establish – and enforce – rules. You can’t avoid either step. One doesn’t work without the other. Your kids will have plenty of friends in their lifetime, but only one mom. You need to be their parent – friend doesn’t cut it. Expectations and limits – and enforcement – are vital to your kids. Simply talking to them is totally inadequate. In fact, it’s nothing but a cop-out. Your kids need absolutes from you, not chit-chat. Give them clearly defined rules, explain the driving principles behind them, and tell them that as a member of your family they’re expected to live by those rules. Then enforce them and never stop. Good parenting requires consistent and fair enforcement of established rules; single parenting demands it. If you want your kids to succeed, you have to be relentless when it comes to keeping them in line. With rules, kids thrive; without them they get lost. Rule #7: Establish Family Traditions – Make Time With Your Kids’ Routine in Your HomeFamily traditions are the most powerful tools in your possession. They ground your kids and give their lives structure. Your children see and feel a strong, undeniable attachment to their family, which creates within them an invaluable sense of belonging. Traditions establish a familiar and special world for your kids. It’s what they do and who they are. They grow comfortable with the routine and secure in their roles. The traditions you choose for your family will define the culture in which your kids are raised, give direction to their lives and leave them with precious memories that will last a lifetime. As one single mom to another: do right by your kids – eat with them, go to church with them and establish other family traditions that put you together with your kids for quality time every single day. Then watch the magic flow. Rule #8: Love Being Your Kids’ Mom As a single mom, appreciate what you have – kids who love you, a home full of family, years packed with great memories. It’s a good life, so live it right and enjoy it to its fullest. Let your kids see how much you love your life with them. Let them know how grateful you are to be their mom, how proud you are to call them your own. Every day look for the joy of being their mom. You’ll find it in their smiles and in the tears you wipe away, in their funny expressions and in their hugs and kisses. You’ll feel the joy when they wake and when they sleep, when they struggle and when they succeed. And it will overwhelm you when they turn and say, “I love you.” Raising kids alone is enormously challenging – and at times brutally difficult. But it’s the most amazing job you’ll ever have – and the most crucial. There is no greater accomplishment in life than being a good parent. So be the mom your kids need. Nothing will fill your heart, your home, or your life with more joy.Adapted from \"Bay and Her Boys: Unexpected Lessons I Learned as a (Single) Mom\" by Bay Buchanan.

The three-and-a-half minute video gives loyal followers insight on the making of the highly-anticipated seventh film of the franchise. Classic stars including Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew and Anthony Daniels could be seen in the clip as well as newcomers Lupita Nyong'o, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Domhnall Gleeson. Director of the flick, JJ Abrams, is shown hyping up the cast and crew as he makes the announcement: 'We are here on day one of Star Wars: Episode Seven. How incredible is that?' Characters getting into their costumes, interviews with the cast, sets being built, majestic scenes of the desert planet Jakku and even explosions were major elements of the video. Hamill, 63, who starred as Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy filmed in the Seventies and early Eighties reflected in the video: 'Real sets, practical effects, you've been here but you don't know this story. 'Nothing's changed really, well, everything has changed but nothing has changed. That's the way you want it to be really.' He was not the only returning cast member who had similar feelings about being on set as Mayhew, 71, talked about getting back in the groove as he put his Chewbacca costume on. The British actor said: 'Getting back to the old days, the old ways of doing things,' before warming up his signature Chewy growl. The legends were not the only ones hyped up about being on set of the highly-anticipated sci-fi flick as the rookies were seemingly in awe of being there. Newbie Boyega, 23, said: 'You have to pause, take a breath, slow down and really not freak out.' Oscar-winner Nyong'o, 32, could be seen for a moment in the clip with lighted CGI dots all over her head, while Ridley is seen excitedly humming as she was about to fly one of the spacecrafts from the film. Irish actor Gleeson, 32, was excited to be a part of the project with past and present stars alike as he explained: 'I was in the same room as all these legends and with all these new people who I'm sure are going to be legends themselves.' Perhaps nothing displayed the spanning of generations pertaining to the upcoming film than the last shot of the clip which showed Ridley getting into the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon with none other than Han Solo himself: 72-year-old Harrison Ford. On Friday, Director Abrams and several of the stars from the film took part in a panel at Comic-Con to discuss the upcoming film. The film is set for release on December 18.",

Your own reflexive racism and divisive rhetoric are poisoning public discourse. There's nothing \"progressive\" about attacking the children and grandchildren of immigrants who proudly embrace an American identity. We are not \"self-hating.\" You just hate what we believe. Next week, we'll be celebrating the 239th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The eloquent cries for freedom and equality voiced in that properly revered document have become what professors Sid Milkis and Marc Landy call the \"American Creed.\" It's a belief that all of us have the right to do whatever we want with our lives so long as we don't interfere with the right of others to do the same. Rachel A. Dolezal, the recently resigned president of the Spokane, Washington, office of the NAACP, has come under a bit of controversy. Both of her parents are white, but for eight years, Dolezal claimed that she was black. In addition to her role as president of an NAACP chapter, Dolezal was an instructor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University. I'm impressed by the coolness and steadiness of our media in suppressing any news about immigration. It's as if they've built a triple-layer fence with border guards around immigration topics. And guess what? Their fence is working! I have often maintained that threats to freedom of expression in this country come predominantly — probably exclusively — from the political left. The censoring of a pro-life student club in a Las Vegas high school is a recent egregious example.",

    "LabBody": "Anna Wintour was photographed by Mario Testino for his Instagram ‘Towel Series’ (Photo: Instagram) The devil might wear Prada, but a glamorous Instagram posted this morning proves that sometimes she wears towels too. Anna Wintour is the latest insider to be snapped by Mario Testino’s lens as part of the fashion photographer’s “Towel Series”. Posted to Instagram Friday morning, Mr. Testino showed the Vogue EIC and Condé Nast artistic director wearing only a towel and a sly grin, looking very BBHMM.

Television pictures showed scenes of devastation, with hundreds of blood-spattered sandals lying at the factory gate.Ambia Begum, 50, who had come to collect charity, alleged that workers of businessman's factory had swooped on them with batons.\"They beat us up severely,\" The Daily Star quoted Ambia as saying. The doctors at the hospital said that the death toll could rise as many are critically injured.The reason of deaths was suffocation and stampede, they said. Police have detained eight people, including Shamim.A three-member investigation team has been formed in this connection and asked to report on the findings within three days.President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Speaker of the parliament Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury expressed their sympathy to the victims' family members.During Ramzan, it is mandatory for Muslims to donate money, food and clothes to the poor as charity.Around 40 people were killed in a similar stampede at a garment factory in the northern city Tangail in 2002.",

John and his fiancee Claire recently had their first baby, Niall. John and Claire decided to come home to Ireland a week early to surprise his parents. They thought they were watching a slideshow of pictures of their first grandchild — but they were slightly mistaken. The slideshow is full of adorable shots of baby Niall — taking baths, cuddling in his crib, laughing with Mom and Dad. The video switches back and forth between the slideshow and John’s parents as they laugh and cry along with the photos. But, of course, nothing is as fabulous as seeing the real thing in person. Little do his parents know, John is right there in the house, standing in the other room with their grandson in tow. When they finally realize the big surprise by the end of the video, I couldn’t help but tear up. What an incredible gift, and what a happy homecoming! It’s easy to see this 11-week old boy is so loved. If this moment touched your heart, please SHARE it with your friends on Facebook!",

    "DiffbotBody": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's new book, A Time For Truth, outsold nearly all of the 20 books on The New York Times' weekly bestseller list. The Texas senator's book ranks fourth on The Wall Street Journal hardcover list and fourth on the Publisher's Weekly hardcover list, Politico points out. And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",
    "LabBody": "Trump's take. Donald Trump slams 'gotcha' journalism after he bombed a simple question about terrorism. 12:43 p.m. ET FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images. The media is back at it with its \"gotcha\" questions, according to Donald Trump, and this time they're from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In a live radio interview Thursday discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hewitt prompted Trump to name the leaders of ISIS, Iran's Quds Force, Hezbollah, the al-Nusra Front, and al Qaeda. Trump's response: He didn't know — yet. \"You know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll all be gone,\" Trump said in the interview. The Independent notes that Hezbollah has had the \"same Secretary General for the past 23 years.\" The interview went further downhill when, after Trump mixed up the Quds Force and the Kurds, Hewitt corrected him. Of course, Trump isn't one to admit defeat, so he took to MSNBC's Morning Joe Friday to lash out at Hewitt and call him a \"third-rate radio announcer.\" \"When you say Kurds vs. Quds, I thought he said 'Kurds,'\" Trump said. \"And it was like 'got you, got you, got you,' and every question is, 'do I know this one, and that one.' You know he worked hard on that.\" Hewitt will be partnering with CNN to moderate the second Republican debate.",

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

We value thoughtful comments representing a range of views that make their point quickly and politely. We make an effort to protect discussions from repeated comments  either by the same reader or different readers. We follow the same standards for taste as the daily newspaper. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence, proselytizing and SHOUTING. Don't include URLs to Web sites. We do not edit comments. They are either approved or deleted. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted in an article.

    "LabBody": "When the signing of the Declaration of Independence was announced on the Fourth of July in 1776, it set off the greatest display of fireworks in the history of the world. No, they were not the kind of fireworks we celebrate with on the Fourth today. They were the fireworks generated by the spirit of freedom, by the desires of free thinking people everywhere to breathe the air of self-determination. It is amazing how the words penned by Thomas Jefferson affected the lives of millions of people all over the globe. In the decade following the creation of the world’s first democracy here in North America, democracy had its birth on the European continent through the French Revolution. Let’s look more closely at the beginning of that great docu- ment. “We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the Consent of the Governed.” In fact, no government before the United States was ever established on the principle that men were created equal. Even some of the founding fathers were very concerned with the ability of “common” men to vote with intelligence and purpose. The only “right” known to the people and governments of Europe was the “divine right of kings.” That was the belief that God placed kings in their positions and, as such, they could do no wrong. They were God’s chosen ambassadors on Earth and were to be followed without question. The Declaration puts in written form what was in the hearts of men everywhere, that we all deserved equal rights and equal protection before the law. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were all judged to be traitors by King George in England. After the signing Benjamin Franklin was heard to say, “We had all better hang together or we shall most assuredly hang separate- ly.” There are probably several hundred thousand people in the United States today who can trace their family tree back to a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The Hopkins family had a signer. His name was Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island. He wasn’t as influential as John Adams or Thomas Jefferson. He wasn’t as eloquent as John Hancock or Benjamin Franklin. But he was there, and he put his life on the line just like the others. He carried the Declaration back to Rhode Island and sold its contents to his constituents. His name still lives today in the history of these United States, as do all the other signers of that Declaration that shaped this great nation of ours. Anderson resident Mark Hopkins, is a former president of three colleges, including what is now Anderson University. He writes columns for the Independent Mail and Gatehouse News Service.

I would like to start by saying I have been a school custodian for more than 26 years making schools clean and safe for all staff and students. First of all, the floor strippers are of low odor and should not be able to be smelled out on the street let alone by those driving by in a vehicle. Second, the products are water soluble and actually mix with water to work. Third, it is not uncommon for flooring kept up with proper care to last for 20-plus years. I think that’s cost effective.

Mechling Rohnert Park Here’s the problem Editor: I get it: The lure and seduction of wine as a current and potentially harmful phenomena. This is a beautiful place to live and thrive, to grow and to welcome visitors. Yet, there’s the significant question of excessiveness with just too much in order to withstand the impact upon water, use of pesticides and events with increased traffic. In jeopardy is the stability of local agriculture (livestock, produce, grape growers and wineries) to describe the standards of living for local purveyors. While economic development may encourage healthy lifestyles, the current answer reveals mere trends with little consideration toward maintaining a quality of life which truly stabilizes the why in the first place. Soon, the initial attractions will no longer have their attractive place in time. What’s then left is a vacancy unable to reconstruct; just too expensive and inaccessible. The “service” sector will not exist, nor then will the schools, neighborhoods, businesses, security, history, culture and diversity. The danger is an unhealthy environment. Literally. Barbara Harris Sebastopol A better solution Editor: Bill O’Reilly of Fox News is advocating Kate’s Law in response to the recent horrific circumstances resulting in Kate Steinle’s murder in San Francsico. His proposal would mandate five-year prison sentences for first-time illegal felons, 10 years for second-time offenders and 20 years for third-time offenders. This would obligate the American taxpayer to provide total housing, food, medical care and basic needs to an unconscionable increase in the already impacted prison population we have. Might a better solution be to recognize our neighbor country Mexico and direct funds and assistance that are presently going to distant countries with little appreciative benefit and recognition. If we were to partner with the leadership in Mexico, they may be able to improve their economy, incarcerate their own citizens, protect the borders and offer homeland opportunities to their citizens. Thus, the illegal immigration may become less attractive or deemed necessary and be beneficial to each of our countries. Shirley Walker Petaluma How about higher? Editor: “Raise the smoking age to 21” (Editorial, Thursday.) Even better, raise it to 80. Gary Anderson Santa Rosa Not made for this Editor: Gov. Jerry Brown’s audacious prison plan, called “realignment,” began in October 2011. Numerous reports have shown increased crime since the plan took effect. Proponents of realignment have dismissed those reports as being “too early to tell.” Thursday’s paper contained two reports on the subject of “realignment.” A story on page B3 stated that after decades of declines, Los Angeles is experiencing a 13 percent rise in crime. Page B5 showed that currently 54 percent of felons are back behind prison walls within three years compared to 67.5 percent in 2011. Is it still too early to tell? Regardless of one’s political leanings, what is clear is that county jails, which were designed to house inmates for one year or less, are now used to house felons for multiple years. Fifteen-year sentences to serve time inside a county jail is not unheard of anymore. To be sure, some money comes from the state to fund the increased burden counties incurred as a result of realignment. The rest comes from the county’s general budget. Isn’t it ironic that the response to inadequate health care in state prisons is to force counties to shoulder the burden? As Los Angeles is discovering, the costs forced upon local government are more than fiscal. Dale C. Miller Owner, Romelli Bail Bonds Santa Rosa Stand firm Editor: San Francisco must not be dissuaded from maintaining its sanctuary movement to protect undocumented immigrants from cruel and unusual treatment thru the inhumane deportation process. Granted one person, one very undesirable person, fell thru the cracks and murdered a special young woman. That occurrence was not the fault of the city and county of San Francisco. What about the murderer’s country of origin? Why did his country allow him free to leave his country? It seems that much better communication between agencies of the U.S. with the agencies of other countries needs to happen. But, San Francisco must maintain its practice of protecting undocumented immigrants. Cassandra Lista Santa Rosa 1 | 2 | 3 | 4",

In fact, it’s gone altogether. After just three years, the upscale/retro Fagiani’s Bar/The Thomas restaurant is shuttering. Call it the curse of the building, which was the site of the town’s most notorious murders, or the revolving door of chefs that came and went from the restaurant. Whatever the reason, the NYC hospitality group behind the 2012 opening, AvroKo, is reinventing the restaurant as Ninebark (the name refers to a woody bush native to the region). What’s really captured our attention: AvroKo has partnered with Michelin-starred wunderkind Matthew Lightner to open the restaurant and handle all of their West Coast culinary operations. And that means not just a new Napa restaurant, but whispers of a second restaurant in Calistoga, and likely other left coast eateries. Lightner rose to fame as executive chef of Castgna in Portland, Oregon, then received two Michelin stars in NYC after opening Atera. His new focus for the restaurant and rooftop bar will be “California-focused, market-forward cuisine based around “innovative preparation techniques”, with proposed menu items like scallops with bottarga, seaweed and buttermilk; skewers of fatty tuna, shiso, peppercorns and sorrel and savory porridge with smoked fish, heirloom rice and sourdough. The Thomas/Fagiani’s is slated to close at the end of July, and Ninebark will hopefully open in early August. Call us stoked. The Patio coming to Petaluma? Rumblings that SoCal's Patio Restaurant Group is eying Petaluma for their next restaurant. The wildly popular San Diego restaurants (three Patio locations, Swell Cafe, The Front Porch shop and the forthcoming Fire Side Cafe) have acknowledged the rumors, but officially say they’re still in discussions about the grand opening and logistics. “It will be part of The Patio Group family,” said reps.

    "DiffbotBody": "COMMENTS Published: Sunday, July 5, 2015 at 1:00 a.m. Last Modified: Thursday, July 2, 2015 at 5:39 p.m. — Chief Justice John Roberts, June 29, 2015 Roberts’ intellectual complexity does not prevent him from expressing himself pithily, as he did with those words when dissenting in a case from Arizona. Joined by Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, Roberts’ dissent should somewhat mollify conservatives who are dismayed about his interpretive ingenuity four days earlier in writing the opinion that saved the Affordable Care Act. Furthermore, they, including this columnist, may have missed a wrinkle in Roberts’ ACA opinion that will serve conservatives’ long-term interests. To end gerrymanders, Arizona voters, by referendum, amended the state’s constitution to strip the Legislature of its control of redistricting. They created an Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) on which no member of the Legislature may serve. However, the U.S. Constitution’s Elections Clause says, “The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” When Arizona’s Legislature sued, the IRC’s implausible response was: The Constitution’s Framers did not use the word “legislature” as it was then and still is used, to denote the representative bodies that make states’ laws. Rather, the IRC said the Framers used “legislature” eccentrically, to mean any process, such as a referendum, that creates any entity, such as the IRC, that produces binding edicts. Implausibility is not an insurmountable barrier to persuading a Supreme Court majority, and last week five justices accepted the IRC’s argument. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said: There is “no suggestion” that when the Framers stipulated that the manner of a state’s elections should be determined of “the legislature thereof,” the Framers necessarily meant “the state’s representative body.” This detonated Roberts, who began his dissent by saying: The reformers who waged “an arduous, decades-long campaign” to achieve ratification in 1913 of the 17th Amendment establishing popular election of U.S. senators could have saved themselves the trouble. They could have adopted what Roberts calls the “magic trick” the majority performed regarding Arizona. What chumps the reformers were for not simply asserting this: Sure, the Framers stipulated that two senators from each state were to be chosen “by the legislature thereof,” but the Framers really meant “by the people.” Roberts said the majority wasted much ink defending a proposition that “nobody doubts” — that the people of Arizona can, under their state constitution, exercise lawmaking powers. They cannot, however, establish governmental processes that violate the U.S. Constitution. With many citations from The Federalist Papers and Supreme Court precedents, Roberts emphasized that a state’s “legislature” was not a term of uncertain meaning when the Framers put it into the Constitution. Many conservatives may be muttering, “Where was this semantically punctilious Roberts four days earlier?” Then, Roberts said that although the Affordable Care Act says insurance subsidies are to be distributed by the IRS through exchanges “established by the state,” the language does not mean this when read in the context of Congress’ clear purpose (broad health care coverage). So, the IRS can distribute subsidies through exchanges established by the federal government. This is not because the court deferred to the IRS, an independent agency, in interpreting the statute. On the contrary, the court denied the power of the IRS — and, inferentially, the power of the executive branch — to be the final word on statutory interpretation. Instead, the court, in the act of deference to Congress’ objective in enacting the ACA, asserted its power to render the final, if properly deferential, word in interpreting what Congress does. Thus did judicial aggression against one branch come cloaked in the cloth of deference to another. Construing the Constitution in the Arizona case, Roberts said the Framers’ language was as clear as their purpose, to which deference is due. Interpreting the health care statute, Roberts said Congress’ language was “inartful” but, read in the context the ACA’s structure, was not ambiguous and should not defeat Congress’ purpose, to which the court owes deference. Roberts’ ruling advanced a crucial conservative objective, that of clawing back power from the executive branch and independent agencies that increasingly operate essentially free from congressional control and generally obedient to presidents. If conservatives cannot achieve their objectives, including ACA repeal, through the legislative branch, conservatism’s future is too bleak to be much diminished by anything courts do. If, however, conservatives can advance their agenda through Congress, they will benefit from Roberts’ ACA opinion, which buttresses legislative supremacy.

    "LabBody": "By GEORGE WILL \"What chumps!\" — Chief Justice John Roberts, June 29, 2015. Roberts’ intellectual complexity does not prevent him from expressing himself pithily, as he did with those words when dissenting in a case from Arizona. Joined by Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, Roberts’ dissent should somewhat mollify conservatives who are dismayed about his interpretive ingenuity four days earlier in writing the opinion that saved the Affordable Care Act. Furthermore, they, including this columnist, may have missed a wrinkle in Roberts’ ACA opinion that will serve conservatives’ long-term interests. To end gerrymanders, Arizona voters, by referendum, amended the state’s constitution to strip the Legislature of its control of redistricting. They created an Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) on which no member of the Legislature may serve. However, the U.S. Constitution’s Elections Clause says, “The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” When Arizona’s Legislature sued, the IRC’s implausible response was: The Constitution’s Framers did not use the word “legislature” as it was then and still is used, to denote the representative bodies that make states’ laws. Rather, the IRC said the Framers used “legislature” eccentrically, to mean any process, such as a referendum, that creates any entity, such as the IRC, that produces binding edicts. Implausibility is not an insurmountable barrier to persuading a Supreme Court majority, and last week five justices accepted the IRC’s argument. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said: There is “no suggestion” that when the Framers stipulated that the manner of a state’s elections should be determined of “the legislature thereof,” the Framers necessarily meant “the state’s representative body.” This detonated Roberts, who began his dissent by saying: The reformers who waged “an arduous, decades-long campaign” to achieve ratification in 1913 of the 17th Amendment establishing popular election of U.S. senators could have saved themselves the trouble. They could have adopted what Roberts calls the “magic trick” the majority performed regarding Arizona.
