    "LabBody": "How many times have you seen something that was clearly wrong go on before your eyes and you said nothing? What if your silence meant risking the life and innocence of someone else? Well, diners at a local cafe got to experience this dilemma firsthand when they overheard a conversation between a 16-year-old girl, Maria and a 40-something man “John” who met her in person for the first time. John told Maria he was also 16 when they spoke online, but when she met him in person, he tried to get her to go with him back to his place to “have fun.” When fellow diners overheard the conversation, they had some crazy reactions to the scene. You have to see this! I was shocked at how the people at the tables nearby reacted. It made me really happy for the state of humanity that people still want to help others. Like one lady who offered rescue for Maria said, “Where I’m from, it takes a village. So your neighbor is your relative. So no, we can’t shut up.” The whole incident of Maria and John meeting may have been a sham with the two actors “performing” for the ABC reality show, “What Would You Do,” but that doesn’t change the severity of the danger that happens everyday. It should be a wakeup call for us all that we can make a difference and when we see something wrong, we should stand up and take action. “I think our parents always taught us,” one of the girls who helped Maria said, “you always step in. You always help someone.” Or maybe Dietrich Bonhoeffer—in the face of Nazis slaughtering Jews—said it best, “Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "For rising UFC star Conor McGregor, mixed martial arts training starts and ends with control. McGregor’s movements revolve around control of his body, mind, and breath. “If it doesn’t involve balance I don’t think it’s beneficial,” says McGregor. “I do yoga every day. I’m perfecting my handstand, I like the tree pose with a side leg extension and the plank/side plank.” Just don’t expect McGregor to get to yoga class on time. The Irish-born featherweight doesn’t keep a schedule in a traditional sense. He simply wakes up and starts moving. “I’m self-taught, and nothing is set by a clock,” says McGregor. “Yesterday, I did pool work, then went to the gym and did jiu-jitsu rounds, pad work, jump rope, core work, and dead hanging from objects.” McGregor does free-weight exercises such as single-leg barbell deadlifts to build strength and balance simultaneously. His most valuable skill, though, is intangible. “My belief is my best asset, and I have a stronger mindset than my opponent,” he says. When M\u0026F last spoke with McGregor, it was a few weeks prior to the announcement that champion Jose Aldo would drop out of the title fight due to a rib injury. His statement in regards to Aldo at the time foreshadowed a change in opponents. “I’ll enter the contest formless and fearless,” McGregor says. “He’s just a blank face and a new body.” McGregor views his history-making opportunity as bigger than himself. He’s in this game to make his Irish supporters proud. “My coach and team have been with me since Day 1, and I look forward to raising the gold for them.” UFC 189: Conor McGregor faces Chad Mendes for the interim UFC featherweight championship on July 11 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

    "LabBody": "SKANEATELES | The Skaneateles Village Board of Trustees plans to release a statement to all village property owners next week to address its position on short-term rental properties within village zoning districts. At the end of Thursday's meeting, the board entered into an executive session for an attorney-client session that Mayor Marty Hubbard said during the meeting was called specifically to discuss the short-term rental issue and the board's response to residents' concerns and opinions. He encouraged residents to continue sending letters and emails to the village hall with their comments on the issue and said the village hall already received a number of letters following a 45-minute public comment session centered on the issue at the board's June 25 meeting. \"I'm pleased with the amount of interest and the sincerity of these letters,\" Hubbard said. \"They're well written and well intended.\" On Friday, the mayor said the whole board did agree to a statement that will be circulated to all village property owners — not just rental property owners — through letter sent via first-class mail. While noting the board did reach a consensus on the statement, Hubbard stopped short of saying all board members held the same opinion on the issue. In addition to property owners, he said the letter will be sent to the local press, the Skaneateles Area Chamber of Commerce, local real estate agents and other interested, pertinent entities in the matter. Hubbard acknowledged the board chose a direct letter rather than an advertisement or legal notice in the newspapers. \"I'm very pleased with the village board's efforts on this,\" he said. \"I'm extremely pleased with (Village Attorney) Mike Byrne's efforts in putting this together. I'm very pleased to have a consensus of opinion on how to move forward.\" The solution to the short-term rental issue, the mayor said, lies in enforcing existing laws rather than writing new laws. He said the front side of the letter will explain that, along with laying out the board's position on the matter. The back side of the letter, he added, will explain how the board plans to administer rental properties in the village and monitor residents' complaints and comments on such properties. One proposed measure in that regard, Hubbard said, is an online system where residents can send concerns about rental properties in a way that separates those comments from other correspondence the village hall receives and highlights those comments to the board more. In other business Thursday, the board voted to transfer the chiller from Austin Park Pavilion to the Skaneateles YMCA and Community Center for use at its second rink, named in memory of Duke Schneider, despite Trustee Jim Lanning's objection and opposing vote. Lanning contended that the chiller is town property that sits on a skid and could be removed from the building. He said the town paid $130,000 for the equipment in 2007 from its emergency fund. Byrne, however, said the chiller is connected to the pavilion's electrical and plumbing systems and, thus, property of the village, which owns the building. He also said the money for the purchase came from William G. Allyn's funding for Austin Park to the village, which in turn gave the money to the town to cover the purchase. While the town can remove items that it owns that are not built into the now-defunct arena, Byrne said the village retains ownership of items such as the chiller and the scoreboard that are connected to the building. By adopting a resolution to approve the transfer, the attorney said the board also declared the equipment surplus. \"I just have a different opinion on that,\" Lanning said before casting his \"no\" vote. MEETING NOTES. Director of Municipal Operations Shannon Harty said the Department of Public Works is reviewing a sidewalk repair plan and aims to perform the work during the week of July 20. The DPW spent the past week repairing water main leaks, she said. Under the 2015-16 village budget, she said Bartlett will receive $3,450 to clean up the trees and remove dead branches in Thayer Park. Skaneateles Volunteer Fire Department Chief Dan Evans reported that he and Code Enforcement Officer John Cromp plan to meet with officials from the Sherwood Inn to discuss safety concerns. The board learned that portable toilets used to supplement the public bathrooms at the Masonic Temple are working well and the bathrooms themselves are in good condition. Trustee Sue Dove reported the Chamber of Commerce will use signage to direct visitors to available parking areas, such as a town-owned parcel on Fennell Street, during the Antique \u0026 Classic Boat show July 24-26. In response to questions from Evans, Harty said she does not know a status of the East Lake Street waterline replacement project and plans to meet with the chief and firefighters to discuss a program for fire hydrant flow testing.

    "DiffbotBody": "GC: You won't be surprised to hear I've yet to find it given the amount of choice on offer. All I can do is sit on the fence as I go through the formbook ahead of a bumper day tomorrow, but I'll have to get off it in the morning as I'm on the Morning Line with Frankie Dettori and Brazen Beau's trainer Chris Waller, two excellent guests. Have a great weekend folks, thanks for all your questions. All the best, GC. GC: A tricky one, Pete. I've never quite gone along with the notion that he's a real crackerjack sprinter but there's always a chance that will be wrong. William Haggas seems to be concerned about the undulations, but overall I wonder whether his close third in that King's Stand was quite good enough to win a race like this. Paul Hanagan has understandably looked elsewhere with Muhaarar and it looks a good decision. GC: There's every chance at least one longshot will hit the frame but it's tough to say which one that might be. I can't back Sole Power given he's 0 from 10 over six furlongs and Anthem Alexander shouldn't be able to beat Muhaarar on Ascot running. G Force has plenty to prove and it wouldn't surprise me if Astaire showed up really well at a big price. I realise he's just under two lengths to find with Brazen Beau on Diamond Jubilee form but he showed excellent speed and that might be seen to better advantage given the way this track seems to be riding at the moment. GC: It's really tough, but I think I have to just edge towards Muhaarar. Everything about his Commonwealth Cup romp suggests he's thriving at the moment and he also receives 6lb in weight-for-age from Brazen Beau even though he's just a half year rather than full year younger than the Aussie who was foaled in the southern hemisphere. He'd be my tentative choice to beat the star Aussie raider in exactly the same way his sire Oasis Dream did against Choisir all the way back in 2003. GC: He's drawn 15 of 15 for the second time in a row. Like you, I can't be sure that racing alone cost him at Ascot, but it's clear he ran an excellent race and once again all the vibes from connections have been very positive. You have to wonder if the shape of the race will be against him. He's clearly fast and capable of going his own way, but the stalls are towards the stands' rail tomorrow which means he will be right out in the centre with the other speed horses Danzeno and Astaire drawn well inside him in stalls four and eight respectively. I'd love to see him win as the sport in general benefits from big time International competition but my confidence hasn't increased with the news he's out on a limb again. James: Hi, How much of an impact do you feel the ride Brazen Beau received at Ascot actually had? The trainer said it didn't, I personally agree with that thought. He did race away from the rest of the pack down the near side but if anything he didn't have a troubled passage like he may have done more centrally. James Doyle takes over the ride and his style should suit this racecourse, any thoughts GC? GC: I've had a pretty good look at the race and Bronze Angel each-way is my pick. Firm Decisions is sure to be bang there for a long way towards the stands' rail but Bronze Angel has a tremendous record in these major handicaps and he ran a screamer in the Hunt Cup, travelling powerfully behind a strong gallop and that bodes well. I've no idea whether his outside draw in stall 20 will be a problem, but I'm confident he's fully effective at seven furlongs and he's just 2lb higher than the mark he won off at Ascot last season. GC: And to you, Chris B. The draw really shouldn't be a major concern at York nowadays. The issue of too many good meetings on one day is a more contentious one and I think my ideal choice would be for the July Festival to move back to Weds-Fri. That said people in racing really do seem able to make a negative out of a positive. We'll have ten terrific live races on C4 tomorrow with about £1.2million in prize-money and 100,000 people likely to be in attendance at York, Chester, Ascot and HQ. That's something to be proud of for the sport as a whole so I'll focus on that and let the bureaucrats decide if and when to shift Newmarket back to its former slot. Chris B: Good morning Graham. Packed programme tomorrow and exciting racing but Imo there are too many big meetings in one day. I am at York for the John smiths cup but because of the July cup the limelight has been taken away from York a little bit. I think it should be a standalone meeting. What are your thoughts? Anyway onto the John smiths do you have a strong fancy for the race? I like look of Arab dawn. Is stall 13 ideal or a little wide. I would have preferred a slightly lower draw. good luck to all tomorrow GC: You've summed it up very neatly Mick. So many of these have taken each other on on a regular basis and with so little to choose between so many runners a bit of luck here and there could be very important. However, I would be inclined to turn a blind eye if people start bashing on about the draw. Loads of horses have won from high draws on the round course in recent times and this race last year saw stall 22 beat stall 18 in a surprisingly steadily run race where very little got into it from off the pace. I hope we don't see a similarly tactical race tomorrow and the stronger they go the keener I'll be on Ajman Bridge. GC: Hope so Harry, but not necessarily with Mount Logan. He could be well-handicapped but I'm hoping Ajman Bridge is set for a big run. I am slightly concerned his coming back in trip a little, but he's well-handicapped racing from the same perch as when pipped by Aran Dawn racing over 1m4f at Ascot. It's clearly just too tough to have a major bet, but it looks like Kirby has chosen Ajman Bridge over Mount Logan and I hope he's right. GC: This looks a really tough race but it's also a cracker and we should get a good gallop with Arabian Queen, Euro Charline and Fintry in there. I've nothing negative to say about Lucida. She was slightly unlucky in both the Guineas and Coronation Stakes for different reasons. That said, the French look very powerful here and I'm drawn towards Avenir Certain at a slightly bigger price. She's a dual Classic winner with a really good turn of foot when she's on song and she stayed on powerfully under a very tender ride at Chantilly last time. Faster ground here poses a new question but they have watered overnight and with Soumillon replacing Benoit she should go well. GC: Hope so Ji. I was really impressed by her Queen Mary performance and she acted like a filly who should be effective over six. Fellow Ascot filly Illuminate is clearly the danger, but she's worth watching beforehand given that Richard Hannon has suggested she could get lit up (pardon the pun) in the preliminaries. EA holds several of these on Ascot form and if she reaches the same level today she'll be very hard to beat. GC: They certainly are flying. Resonant showed yesterday that the Braveheart horses just bounce back and bounce back. That said, Rah Rah might be in a bit deep here. The winner Acapulco wasn't drawn far away from her in the Queen Mary and on that line of form she's plenty on to reverse form with Easton Angel. GC: You won't be the only one Tony. That maiden came after C4 had gone off air but this Braveheart filly came with a major reputation and lived up to it and then some. She powered clear with precious little assistance needed from William Buick. Her final time was six lengths slower than Shalaa in the July Stakes, but she recorded by far the fastest final two furlong split of the day in a performance described by Timeform's Simon Rowlands as 'mustard or possibly even hot mustard.' In short, she looks a Pattern race winner waiting to happen and she will have no problem getting further down the line. GC: Good question, Ian. The July Stakes has been won by plenty of horses that have gone on to win more good races, often at Glorious Goodwood, and it's also worth remembering last year's renewal saw Dewhurst winner Belardo and Commonwealth Cup hero Muhaarar get turned over by Ivawood. I'm sure there's plenty of room at the top for more changes among the 2yo colts and Shalaa is bang up there. It was the second best juvenile Timeform time figure (115) behind the Queen Mary winner Acapulco. I'm pretty sure there are a few big stables with good colts that haven't shown their hand yet but Shalaa has the potential to win another big one over six or possibly seven furlongs. GC: I certainly couldn't have found him. As regards Spencer's ride, it was clearly nicely judged but the times certainly don't suggest that he nicked the race in any way in fact, Big Orange went faster than Mr Singh at practically every split until the closing stages and I just think that the winner belatedly blossomed on the sort of wide-galloping course that suits his style perfectly. GC: Depends completely on what turns up, Phil. John Gosden has the best 3yos around but half of them won't be going anywhere near Town Moor. Storm The Stars heads the market at the moment based on his Epsom third and Curragh second. Aidan O'Brien has a posse of possible contenders who could improve before September too, so at this stage Mr Singh should be considered as a smart colt with room for more improvement. But it's hard to argue what he achieved at Newmarket against 90-odd rated horses yesterday marked him out as a potential Classic winner. GC: I think a lot will depend on how he fares if he goes to the Arc. I must admit I haven't taken too much notice of the ratings debate. I saw Frankel had the same rating at the same stage but that side of things make less appeal then they used to. The main thing is we see him as often as possible before he does retire and if he does win a King George and an Arc then he's going to compare favourably with the rest... barring Frankel as a 4yo of course. GC: I'm pretty sure he'll be fully effective over both distances after last week. A bigger field would clearly have been ideal but it was great to see him beat The Grey Gatsby so convincingly in the end and to have an unbeaten Derby winner is a terrific boost to any Flat season. It's a bit depressing to hear his owner making retirement plans already but he clearly sets the bar very high for the King George providing he stays on top of his game. If Jack Hobbs does too we're in for a very special Arc indeed.",

    "LabBody": "COLUMBIA — When Genie Rogers first came to the Columbia Housing Authority as a volunteer in 1990, she found a mess. \"The Housing Authority was in great turmoil,\" said Phil Steinhaus, the CEO of the Columbia Housing Authority. \"There were issues with crime, issues with high vacancy rates, staffing issues and funding issues.\" Rogers has spent the past two decades making the Housing Authority better. After years of work, the Columbia Housing Authority in 2011 was named to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's list of high-performers, or agency's that earned a 90 percent or higher score in inspections for criteria such as expense management, vacancy rates and rate of occupant turnover. For her efforts, Rogers was honored Monday with the 2015 Howard B. Lang Jr. Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service to the city of Columbia. \"I feel very strongly that we all owe a debt of responsibility to this community that we live in,\" Rogers said. \"Columbia is a wonderful place to live, and I think one of the reasons that it's so unique is that so many people answer the call to participate in the process. That's what ... also makes it a high quality place to live.\" Steinhaus said he met Rogers in 1993 while she was a chair on the Boone County Community Services Advisory Commission; Steinhaus was the city staff member assigned to the commission. He left his job with the city and came to the Housing Authority in 2006 — on the suggestion from Rogers. \"I've always been amazed what a hard worker Genie is,\" Steinhaus said. \"She's always just been inspiring to me with her service and dedication to the community. ... It's been a pleasure to work with her.\" In her more than 35 years in community service, Rogers has also worked with the Boone County Community Services Advisory Commission, where she ultimately spent 12 years; the Central Missouri Humane Society; and the Columbia Cemetery Association, among other organizations. \"I have enjoyed the things that I've done tremendously,\" Rogers said. \"I feel like every single volunteer role I've played has been incredibly beneficial to me. ... I just hope that I was a change agent ... in the lives of the people who were affected by some of the things I did and the policies I helped to create.\" The Howard B. Lang Award includes a monetary prize, which Rogers has decided to give to the Columbia Housing Authority's Moving Ahead youth program. She said the program has lost a large portion of the funding it used to receive from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \"I didn't know about the $1,000 until about a week ago. I was stunned,\" Rogers said. The Moving Ahead program provides after-school activities, tutoring and food for local children. Supervising editor is John Schneller.",

    "LabBody": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet state Chief Ministers next week to discuss the land bill in an attempt to break the deadlock over the policy, government officials said. The Modi Government is determined to push through the land bill that seeks to exempt land purchases for certain industrial, housing and infrastructure projects from requiring the consent of 80 per cent of landowners. Opposition parties have staunchly resisted the bill, calling it 'anti-farmer'. Lawmakers in the Upper House of Parliament, led by the Opposition Congress party, have repeatedly blocked the legislation. To build consensus, the Government has introduced several amendments to the bill and formed a parliamentary committee to examine compensation clauses and resettlement of farmers. Modi has asked the panel to submit its report at the beginning of the upcoming session, but the committee has appealed for more time. Modi has called the second meeting of the governing council of the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog for July 15, about a week before the monsoon session of Parliament is set to begin. The meeting will have \"many items on the agenda,\" economist and NITI Aayog member Bibek Debroy told Reuters. But the focus of the meeting will be the land bill, according to two senior sources with knowledge of the arrangements. The monsoon session is expected to be a tumultuous one, with the contentious land, labour and GST bills on the table, and simmering political scandals threatening to disrupt proceedings.",

    "LabBody": "ROCKFORD — Joey Watts appreciates an audience. \"I love the crowd. I like people clapping for me,\" he said. Marcus Smith, arguably the best young golfer in Rockford history, stole Watts' crowd for an hour and interrupted a Watts-Kyle Slattery playoff. But in the end, Watts got his crowd back. And the Boys Stateline Golf Championship. Watts birdied the final hole to force a playoff with Slattery, then birdied the second hole of a playoff for both the overall title and the 17-18 age division crown. Watts, who plans to play for Rock Valley College after finishing a couple of credits this summer at Harlem, bombed a 320-yard drive on the 508-yard, par-5 second playoff hole, then two-putted from 45 feet for the winning birdie. \"I just let it rip all day,\" said Watts, who shot 71-70 for a 1-under-par 141 at Ingersoll. \"I figure the closer I can get to the hole, the less chance to hit bad shots from a shorter distance.\" It was another runner-up finish for Slattery (70-71), who has taken second behind Kevin Flack in the three major adult tournaments so far this year (Atwood, Ballard and Mauh-Nah-Tee-See Match Play). \"I give it my best every time, but it kind of stinks to get second,\" said Slattery, a Boylan grad who will be a freshman at Southern Illinois-Edwardsville this fall. \"I just missed putts all day. I made a bunch of pars, with two birdies and two bogeys, so it was kind of a slow round. I made six birdies in two rounds. I have to get that close to 10.\" Smith, a 13-year-old eighth grader at Winnebago, won the 13-14 age division by 30 strokes. Officials stopped the playoff after Slattery just missed a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 1 when word came that Smith was four strokes back with six holes to play. They planned to resume quickly, but Smith immediately birdied 13 and 14, leaving him two strokes behind with the easiest four-hole stretch on the course yet to play. But Smith missed an 18-foot birdie putt on the 118-yard par-3, then made bogey on the 294-yard par-4 when he drove into a green-side bunker and bladed his sand shot over the green. \"I started putting too much pressure on myself after the two birdies in a row,\" Smith said. \"If you asked me how I made the birdies, I can't say. You just have to hit the shot when you have to do it, and I did it. But I messed up on the short par 4.\" Needing an eagle on 17, the 5-foot-4, 110-pound Smith blasted his drive 280 yards and was pin high to the right in two shots. But his 50-foot eagle chip stopped 15-foot short and his birdie putt lipped out, stopping Smith's fist pump in mid-pump. \"I honestly didn't think I was going to hit it that far,\" Smith said. \"I guess it was just super adrenaline, excited but nervous at the same time.\" \"I have to give him props,\" Watts said, before going back to play another round of golf with his dad. \"He's playing out of his shoes. He's probably going to win it the next five years.\" Other age group winners were: Alex Klein for ages 15-16, Braden Hogan (son of eight-time Men's City champ Jamie Hogan) for ages 11-12, Cooper Watt for ages 8-10 and Dillon Nebiu for ages 5-7.

    "DiffbotBody": "A team of researchers from MIT have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code. It turns out software and fruit have something in common: they both can rot. But while a banana that’s been sitting out too long can’t turn fresh again, old software code that no longer functions like it once did can be revitalized. A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the university’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory have discovered a way to automatically restore old, poorly performing software to fresh code, MIT said this week. This is a big deal for companies that might spend thousands of dollars on developers to restore old software that may not work as efficiently as it once did. Often times software programs written several years ago no longer function properly on the latest computers and hardware, explained MIT Professor Saman Amarasinghe in an interview with Fortune. The reason is because software has to be tailored to work for computers. Each time hardware technology advances and the performance of machines increases, a software program needs to get rejiggered to accommodate the changes. Typically, coders spend a lot of hours going through the program’s software to make changes, add more lines of code, and add algorithms that ensure that the software works efficiently with the hardware specs of the day. However, each time a programmer tweaks the software and adds new code, the program steadily becomes more bloated. Additionally, the algorithms and extra code used to match the software to current hardware specifications can often become invalidated as the next-generation gear launches into the market. Coders can have a difficult time removing all the extras, which leads to a program that experiences what is known as software rot. Once the code is rotten, the program as a whole can be slow as molasses and even unresponsive when you try to get it up and running. This is where the MIT researchers come in. The MIT team developed a software system called Helium that basically scans the rotten software, discovers the most crucial lines of code that the original programmers developed to make it function, and then builds a revised version of the program that works with the hardware specs that the MIT team wants it to match. What used to be a month’s long process, the MIT researchers claim can now be cut down to an hour. Amarasinghe explained that MIT tested out its Helium system with some engineers from Adobe ADBE -0.57% who were looking for ways to make the over-two-decade-old Photoshop program run faster and process images more quickly with the advancements in modern hardware tech. Whereas Google and Facebook have been running software that might be as young as three years, Adobe and other companies might have programs or applications that haven’t aged too well as the years have gone by, Amarasinghe said. In this case, the Adobe engineers wanted a way to make Photoshop run better without having to spend the traditional man-power needed to do the job. MIT claims that when they used Helium to revise Photoshop, the program’s performance increased by 75 percent. Say goodbye to the slow loading times for your favorite vacation pictures you want to make more colorful. As of now, Helium is not quite ready for primetime and it could be a few more years before it’s ready for widespread use, Amarasinghe said. Adobe was only testing out Helium and is not going to be using it in its products as of now. Also, while Helium can restore older code, it currently only works on image-processing software like Photoshop, because getting a program to display an image is a relatively easier task compared to other more complex software, he said. Still, if Helium pans out, Amarasinghe said it could have a lot of benefits to businesses. The healthcare industry, for example could save a lot of time having to upgrade their image-processing software for medical devices like X-ray machines as the hardware advances.

    "LabBody": "I visited with Steve Clark during a tour Wednesday of the massive, state-of-the-art Woodward Inc. factory and office complex after a ribbon-cutting ceremony there. He's the guy who was in charge of finding property where the $2 billion-a-year company could build a 450,000-square-foot-plant to make aircraft fuel-system components. Clark is a broker with Dickerson \u0026 Nieman Realtors. The deal he spearheaded paved the way for one of the biggest building projects — $250 million — in Winnebago County history, one expected to add more than 700 good jobs by 2021. Clark told me about the number of property owners he dealt with to make the 70-acre-or-so deal in Loves Park: about a dozen. I asked why the Subway sandwich shop at Forest Hills and Harlem roads in Loves Park was still there. After all, a car lot, a dog-grooming parlor, an antiques store and some houses were razed. He said Woodward had acquired the Subway property, and the building will come down in a few years when the retailer's lease expires. But three houses a few yards to the east of Subway remain on the north side of Harlem at the corner of Forest Hills. Otherwise the stretch to North Perryville Road is occupied only by Woodward. The owners didn't want to sell, Clark said. That afternoon, I stopped to talk with one of them about the holdout. Patricia Board, 82, was sitting in a lawn chair in her driveway as her daughter, Melanie Esklor, mowed the lawn. Board owns two of the houses, separated by a driveway and a bit of grass. One is where she grew up. The other is a three-bedroom ranch built in the mid-1950s by her husband, who has since died, on property that once housed a lumberyard. The lumberyard land also was where Board rode her Shetland pony when she was a preteen. And it was home to Pat's Root Beer Stand when she was a teen. She and other youths her dad hired served root beer floats and burgers during summer for years. That was until she started dating Wayne Board, whom she married years later. Her dad closed the stand, saying his daughter \"has lost interest,\" Board said. \"We were 'in the country' then,\" she said, as car after car passed. Her mother's brother owned a grocery nearby, and her aunt lived where the Clinton family lives now, right behind Subway. \"I love it here,\" Board said. \"I've lived here all my life.\" Even if she had been offered more money than she was for the houses, \"I don't think I would have sold.\" Dan Clinton didn't sell to Woodward because \"it was a really low offer. ... I'm not going to lose money on my home.\" Clark told me when I called him Thursday that Clinton's house is \"very attractive, but an over-improvement for the neighborhood.\" Since 2010, Clinton and his family have lived in the 100-year-old residence they gutted and renovated. Clinton has always lived in the Harlem Road area. \"We're not ready to move yet.\" Woodward was founded in 1870 in Rockford. It moved its headquarters to Fort Collins, Colorado, several years ago and has employed about 1,500 people in Loves Park in recent years. The company considered locations for the new plant in other states before deciding to build here. Production at the new facility is expected to start within a few months. Clark said Woodward is still interested in buying the Board and Clinton properties. He said the intent is to make the Harlem-Forest Hills corner \"parklike, to enhance the setting.\" Time will tell.

    "LabBody": "“On the occasion of the inauguration of Metrorail, why don’t you write something on rail heritage?” asked my good friend, K. Saravanan. It’s well-known that the first railway line of South India was from Royapuram to Arcot and that the train was flagged off on June 26, 1856 by the then Governor of Madras, Lord Harris. The Metro had its inaugural run in the 210th year of the Railways’ debut in Madras, starting off on June 29, 2015. The Madras Railway Company (MRC) began its work in 1853, when a team of three — George Barclay Bruce, Chief Engineer; Edward Smalley, Agent and Major T.T. Pears, Consulting Engineer, took charge. Construction proceeded at a brisk pace thereafter, Bruce designing the Royapuram Station and much of the civil structures. The arrival of the first four steam engines, each weighing 13 tonnes, was quite an event, for they were the heaviest consignments till then to be delivered at Madras. These “ponderous masses of iron”, all made at Glasgow, arrived on board the ship Haveling on June 13, 1855. The Governor, a number of gentlemen and a “fair sprinkling of ladies” proceeded to the Royapuram beach to witness their offloading. There was no harbour then, and the ship was docked two miles at sea. The engines had to be hoisted by cranes from the ship, lowered on to a waiting raft and then rowed ashore. The process of offloading took a day for each engine, and by Monday, June 18, all four were safely on the beach. How they were taken to the railway tracks is an unresolved mystery. By 1856, there were 65 miles of operating track. The railway earned 5,196 pounds sterling in the first three months of operation — 39, 903 passengers contributing to 3,101 pounds out of the total revenue. The Metro has seen that many passengers on the first day itself! Like the Metro, the railway took forever to build to its final length of 450 km. In the initial days, it was criticised, as beginning nowhere, running through nowhere and ending nowhere, for Royapuram and Arcot were relatively unknown destinations. Bruce was more or less the E. Sreedharan of his times, for he completed the 65 miles of the Madras railway line in record time. But his health broke down in the process and by December 1857, he returned to England. Being an active Freemason, his brothers in the order gave him a grand farewell, an event presided over by the Chairman of the MRC, Robert Stephenson. Back home, Bruce had a long and illustrious career, and eventually received knighthood. The MRC offices at Royapuram can still be seen as sad ruins from the over bridge. The station, now the oldest surviving terminal in the Indian subcontinent, also stands, though threatened with demolition. In a way, it is the forefather of all other rail transport in the city — the Southern Railway, the suburban system, the MRTS and now the Metro.",

    "DiffbotBody": "If you are at Chicago's Midway Airport or on board a Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) flight in the days ahead, don't be surprised if you see a lot of smiling Southwest flight attendants in your midst. Midway is Southwest's largest hub, and home base for many of the carrier's flight attendants. Late last week, the executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, who represent more than 13,500 Southwest flight attendants altogether, voted to approve a tentative new contract, which over the next several weeks will be presented to the full membership to ratify. A spokesman for Local 556 today said the vote on the new contract should be completed by the end of July. If, as expected, the contract is approved by the full union membership, Southwest flight attendants would, according to Local 556 President and lead negotiator Audrey Stone, \"continue to be the highest paid in the (airline) industry through 2019.\" The new contract also would be retroactive to 2013 when negotiations began. A spokesman for Local 556 said the contract does include pay raises for flight attendants, who in turn would agree to work rule revisions in exchange for the higher pay. Full details of the tentative new collective bargaining agreement will be released soon, the Local said. Southwest's tentative new contract with its flight attendants, however, still leaves the low-fare behemoth without new contracts with three major units in its workforce — pilots, mechanics and ramp agents who handle baggage and other crucial plane servicing functions at the gate. Southwest flight attendants were in negotiations for two years on their new contract. But ramp agents, who are growing increasingly restless, have been without a new contract for some four years. A large group of ramp agents recently picketed Southwest's annual meeting, and ramp agents who were unhappy about the excruciatingly slow progress of contract talks are believed to have been a key factor in the historic Southwest Airlines meltdown at Midway Airport in early 2014 that left 16 Southwest planes filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. The recent picketing and other rumblings about labor unrest at Southwest may have prompted Southwest CEO Gary Kelly to speed up efforts to get new contracts with all of the various unions who comprise his airline's workforce. Any major concerns about possible employee strikes could cause Southwest customers to consider booking flights with competitors instead.",

Her ability to mix comedy and drama is unparalleled. And we can't wait to see how Margo and Alan deal with each other.\" Martindale previously recurred on The Americans, but left the show due to scheduling conflicts when she landed a role on The Millers. (She returned for one episode last season after The Millers was abruptly canceled.) Martindale also won an Emmy for playing Mags Bennett on Justified.

    "LabBody": "It’s been a year, but the pain hasn’t subsided. Make no mistake: Isaiah Austin still aches to play basketball. A surprise diagnosis of Marfan syndrome altered his career plans in the days leading up to the 2014 NBA draft. Austin admits he still hasn’t completely recovered from that stunning news. “I’m still trying to get past it to this day. I’m surrounded by basketball each and every day, so it’s hard for me not to miss the game,” the former Baylor center said. “I had so much love and passion for it, that it’s hard for me not to miss it. It’s just a daily process. Seeing these people, they’re definitely the type of people that are helping me get through it.” The people to which Austin was referring were the dozens of Baylor fans who turned out Friday for a pair of book signings for his new autobiography, “Dream Again: A Story of Faith, Courage and the Tenacity to Overcome.” He wrote the book with the hopes of inspiring people. In the end, he has drawn his own inspiration from the fans, who were lined up at the Baylor Bookstore long before the first signing session even began Friday. “Seeing all the smiles on their faces,” Austin said. “People are lined up to get my autograph, and I should be the one who should be shaking their hand and getting their autographs, because they are my support system. I really wouldn’t be here without them.” The soundtrack of a dribbling basketball has pulsed all throughout Austin’s life. His uncle Isaac played 10 years in the NBA, and the 7-foot-1 Isaiah appeared destined for a pro career as well. At Baylor, he hounded shooters as an uncharitable rim protector, rejecting 2.4 shots per game over two seasons. He also displayed a smooth outside touch, setting himself up for a potential future as a “stretch four” in the NBA, or in layman’s terms, a power forward who can shoot the ball from the outside. Even before his Marfan diagnosis, Austin had toyed with the idea of writing a book someday. He suffered a severe eye injury as a middle school student after being struck by a baseball. He eventually lost all sight in the eye and had to be fitted for a prosthetic. Occasionally, he’d talk with his mother Lisa about chronicling his journey in overcoming his eye injury, and how his faith helped him persevere. “It started when I had my eye surgery,” Austin said. “My mom always told me something great was going to come of it. She always talked to me about relaying my story and my testimony to as many people as I can. We talked about writing a book, and then once I found out about Marfan syndrome and with everything that was going on, we just thought it was the perfect time.” Austin said his first call was to Baylor coach Scott Drew. He figured his old coach would provide some astute direction, and he was right. Austin eventually agreed to a publishing contract with Simon and Schuster, and worked with author Matt Litton on the project. However, he discovered that writing a book isn’t like making a layup. More like a full-court hook shot — blindfolded. “(It took) patience. Being able to tap into all your feelings in the past, sitting there at night trying to remember each and every last detail,” Austin said. “Just describing things. Sometimes I’d have to get on the phone with Matt for three or four hours, just talking to him about my life. “It’s been amazing, and I’m glad it’s over with because it took forever. It really did take forever. It was a stressful, stressful six months, but it was fun. I’m glad the outcome is becoming great.” The future tantalizes Austin, 21, with promise, but he remains uncertain about which direction he may travel. He plans to finish his degree at Baylor — he’ll start his senior year in the fall — and expects to help out again with the men’s basketball team as a volunteer assistant, as he did last season, though on a more limited basis. Coaching intrigues Austin. He also intends to continue his advocacy for the Marfan foundation. He has been the disease’s most visible spokesperson since his diagnosis last June. Then there is the promise of a job offer from NBA commissioner Adam Silver, once he completes his studies. That’s not a bad backup plan. For now, the gentle giant is both gracious and grateful to be able to share his story — especially with those enthusiastic Baylor fans. “Baylor Nation is basically my backbone. God is my foundation, and Baylor Nation is my housing,” Austin said. “So I know that I can’t go wrong with them, and I promise them that they’re not going to go wrong with me by supporting me.”",

    "LabBody": "ELKHART — In a continued effort to promote walkability and attract visitors to the businesses around Cassopolis Street, the city of Elkhart will add new sidewalks, lighting and trees to the area around Northpointe Boulevard. Because this is area gets a lot of visitors, the city is working to make it more attractive, said Leslie Biek, right-of-way engineer. “We’re trying to get (visitors) walking around to nearby restaurants and helping to revitalize the area,” Biek said. The addition of about 4,140 linear feet of new sidewalks, lighting and trees will go from Northpointe Boulevard to C.R. 4 on Caravan Drive and on David Drive to S.R. 19 and back to Northpointe Boulevard. On the map below, the red is where sidewalks, lighting and trees will be added. The black is where sidewalks already exist. This project is a continuation of development the city has been doing with the Caravan Drive Sidewalk and Lighting project, Biek said. However, it’s not as extensive as work they did in 2013 with the addition of a roundabout at Northpointe Boulevard and Caravan Drive. They aren’t even touching the roads. “It’s more of a light enhancement,” Biek said. The Board of Public Works approved the plans at its meeting Tuesday, July 7. The construction estimate for the project is $437,000, which will come from the Cassopolis TIF fund, Biek said. The Redevelopment Commission has already appropriated funding. About half the cost — $200,000 — of the construction estimate is the 21 lights, Biek said. They are looking for cheaper lights in the style of those already on Northpointe. Bids will open at the beginning of August, and Biek said she expects construction will start in early September and be done by the end of October. “I don’t think it’ll take longer than a couple of months — the only thing that might linger is the lights. We’ll get all we can done by the end of October and have the lights installed whenever they arrive,” she said. This area is a big part of current development in Elkhart. This fall, construction for a new Holiday Inn Express will begin on land adjacent to North Pointe Plaza, and the owner of the hotel, Praful Palan, praised the city’s effort to improve the area, according to previous reporting by The Elkhart Truth.",

It’s not funny, the masses whined. I miss McConaughey and Harrelson, they said. There’s too much going on, they moaned. If you simply wanted a repeat of season one, why bother tuning in? Better to just rewatch that mesmerizing Louisiana-set first season than to bother with a new story I say. I hope I’m not coming off as a smarter-than-thou d-bag elitist. I loved season one as much as the next admirer of Southern Gothic drama. I was just open going into season two to a new setting, new characters, a new tone, a new world. And as any film buff worth their salt knows, SoCal is about as good as it gets for crime fiction. I couldn’t wait to see what they cooked up. And by and large, I’m diggin’ it. But where I’m really diggin’ it is in those inspired touches that smack of David Lynch meets James Ellroy: the dream sequence with Velcoro and his cop father that began episode three; the Bel-Air mansion that houses a mayor’s drugged-out European trophy wife; the apparently insatiable sexual appetite that one Vinci City Manager Ben Casper left in his wake. It’s pulpy, it’s juicy, it’s weird. And I like it. So, Mr. Pizzolatto, if I may, leave the by-the-numbers portrait of the repressed homosexual cop behind.

    "LabBody": "Call it a case of life imitating art imitating life. Waco singer-songwriter-handyman Wes Cunningham is back performing onstage at the World Cup Café, where he will be Saturday night. Five years ago, he was there acting in the indie movie “Sironia,” whose plot mirrored his life in some ways. And in his pre-”Sironia” life, he worked to create that café, helping lay the red-and-white tile wall that frames its kitchen window. The café, an outgrowth of Mission Waco’s multiyear effort to revitalize the neighborhood near the corner of Colcord Avenue and North 15th Street, is experimenting with opening on Saturday nights this summer. Mission Waco executive director Jimmy Dorrell — a longtime friend of Cunningham and his wife, Emilie, who have lived in that neighborhood for more than a decade — called up the musician to ask if he would perform on some of those Saturday nights. It didn’t take much to persuade him. “It’s a blast to come up here and play,” the 43-year-old Cunningham said. “It’s really casual and informal.” Casual enough that friend and Waco pedal steel player Tim Jenkins has joined him, along with Emilie, on the small corner stage in the café’s Fair Trade Market. The room, with its walls hung with handcrafted art and items from around the world, was rearranged several months ago to accommodate tables and seating, and has worked as a meeting space of sorts, Dorrell said. “People who used not to drive through this neighborhood now play bridge here,” he said. The café has expanded its menu for Saturday nights, adding entrees featuring chicken, pasta, fish and beef with appetizers, salads and desserts. More than 70 people attended the first Saturday night dinner last month. Included was an Austin couple celebrating their third wedding anniversary, who requested the Cunningham song to which they had danced at their wedding. Succeeding weeks have seen crowds averaging around 40 people, with Waco musicians Evan Klaras and Bob Scott playing when Cunningham couldn’t. Back on stage. The Saturday night gigs — he also is scheduled to play July 18 — put Cunningham back performing in the public’s eye, something he admits he hasn’t done much of in recent years outside of playing at Mission Waco’s Church Under the Bridge on Sundays. He writes for a “well-heeled rock band” in Austin, which he can’t name publicly, and composes for the occasional videogame and soundtrack. Music is only one piece of a life that finds him repairing and renovating old homes — a sort of solo “fixer-upper” — and raising three boys, ages 11, 8 and 6, with his wife. It’s a different life than the music-driven one the Baylor University graduate pursued in the 1990s, signing with major label Warner Bros. He stepped away when its emotional and spiritual cost became too high. That decision proved the right one. “I am totally happy here,” he said. That story proved a framework for the 2010 film “Sironia.” Texas-based director Brandon Dickerson used a screenplay that Dickerson, actor-playwright-Baylor theater instructor Thomas Ward and Cunningham collaborated on while all three lived in Waco. Cunningham not only wrote and performed the songs in the film, but also starred in it, playing the lead character of singer-songwriter Thomas Fisher. In the film, which screened at the Austin Film Festival and the Dallas International Film Festival, Thomas moves with his wife to the small Texas town of Sironia after months of soul-sucking frustration with the merciless music business in Los Angeles. Personal peace. A smaller, slower life in Sironia proves frustrating, too, until the musician finds a personal peace with deeper values in life that, eventually, help him reconnect with his music. The movie, the DVD of which is sold at the Fair Trade Market, won praise at film festivals and cities where it screened, but Cunningham confessed he was a little disappointed it didn’t open more doors for creative work. Still, the lessons that the fictional Thomas learns are the two that Cunningham acquired years earlier in coming back to Waco, helping get World Cup Café started and raising a family: “It’s not going to be OK — It’s OK right now,” he said. “And, my motto: ‘Do the work, show up and leave the results to God.’ ” There’s another lesson found when he played at Church Under The Bridge and realized he wasn’t under pressure to please an audience or maintain a professional career — a lesson his World Cup Café audiences come to realize: “Church Under the Bridge totally freed me,” he said. “I realized I love to sing.” ----- If you go. What: Wes Cunningham and friends. When: 5:30 to 8 p.m. Saturday. Where: World Cup Café, 1321 N. 15th St. Admission: Free.",

    "LabBody": "WILTON — The renovation project at the Comstock Community Center continues on schedule and on budget, with Sept. 1 as the target date for completion of Phase 1, according to several officials associated with the project. Construction work on Phase 2, which includes the west wing and the café, will begin in September and should be completed by the end of January 2016, said Stephen Giametta, project superintendent from Turner Construction. One of the biggest recent developments at Comstock since Phase 1 began on March 9 was the removal of the old “monster” boiler, and the installation of new, smaller, twin boilers that will work much more efficiently, Giametta said. “We had to destroy the monster to get it out of the basement,” Giametta said. “It was so big we had to take it out in pieces. (The boiler room) is being re-vamped, and it’s like a chess game. We’re putting in new switch gear and panels, and we’re constantly reworking the system so we can install the next part.” Giametta said there is a method to this seeming madness. “We need to maintain existing service and still build the new system to maintain minimal service to the occupants,” said Giametta, who has been with Turner Construction for 15 years. “That’s challenging.” Comstock Community Center did not have a sprinkler system, something this renovation will correct. “We heard about a new sprinkler system, and the sprinkler pipe connects from the outside line into the boiler room,” Giametta said. “The pipes run down these tunnels, with no lights. We had quite a few guys crawling in and out of these tunnels for months — not days — months.” Judy Zucker, chairman of the Comstock Renovation Building Committee, wishes everyone could see the old building, as it is being retrofitted for the 21st century. “It takes a bit of imagination when things are stripped down and going to be re-built,” Zucker said. “We’re taking a building from the 1950s and transforming it. We’re making (Comstock) new and up to code.” That was also Giametta’s focus as he talked about installations and materials. “There’s a new sprinkler system being installed, when the building currently doesn’t have one,” Giametta said. “Pipes are being put in now. A good way to put it is out with the old and in with the new, new, new.” One of those new additions will be the walls of the classrooms — high-impact gypsum that Giametta described as mold and mildew resistant. Zucker talked about the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) unit that will be “all new, for the old wing.” “The unit on top of the building has been replaced,” Giametta said. “It’s a new roof-top unit. We’re using existing duct work because it’s been deemed acceptable.” With no ceiling panels in place, Giametta was able to point out the “snake trays” — long wire baskets that follow the hallways — to hold crucial wiring. “(The snake trays) will hold data wires,” Giametta said. “The new electrical wiring will run in the walls.” With boiler removal, sprinkler pipes and wiring issues, it came as something of a surprise when Giametta said his biggest challenge was walls. “The biggest challenge is the condition of the existing walls,” Giametta said. “Some corners are not exactly square, not plumbed. We’ve overcome these issues. To date, these are issues you’d expect in an older building. Don’t get me wrong. It doesn’t make the overall job any easier. But we’ve overcome all of the issues so far.” The gymnasium will get an overhaul, including an addition that will make sweaty athletes happy. “There will be air-conditioning in the gym for the first time,” Zucker said. “People who use it will appreciate that.” Giametta said that, other than the installation of ductwork and sprinkler piping, the gym will remain largely the same, with a composition floor and appropriate striping. “We didn’t change any footprint of the building,” Zucker said. “The gym will be the same size.” New glass and upper and lower exterior — and interior — panels are making the windows much more attractive and energy efficient, Zucker said. Inside, the panels will be hidden by shelving and heating units, and the exterior panels are a muted shade of pewter. A new bathroom has nearly been finished on the lower level near the arts and crafts room, with new wall and floor tiles, and the arts and crafts room itself has new flooring and cabinetry. New flooring will be installed throughout the lower level during night hours the weekend of July 10 through 12, Giametta said. “Every room is being made safer, healthier and up to modern codes and standards,” Giametta said. Zucker added that handicap accessibility is a crucial part of this entire process. One section of the Center that is not as far long is the main entrance/lobby area, which is planned to be expanded and modernized, Zucker said. “There will be a vestibule, and the office will be protected from the elements and other things,” Zucker said. “There won’t be leaves blowing into the lobby.” Giametta talked about the steel canopy over the entrance, and the efforts it takes to put such a structure in place. “There is a lot of coordination between concrete pouring, plumb lines, string lines,” Giametta said. “In general, this high level of coordination to get sub-contractors on the same page is nothing out of the ordinary, but it involves concrete, masonry and brick work. It’s fair to say the main entrance will be the last segment completed. This is a full renovation.” Zucker expounded on getting 30 to 35 workers per day on the same page. “We have 17 major trade contracts, and some of them have sub-contractors,” Zucker said. “You can imagine the scheduling. We’re on a very ambitious timetable, but when we put in a new fire alarm system, a new sprinkler system and all the other measures, people will be safer.”",

    "LabBody": "ORMOND BEACH – When Jill Aversa spotted an egg in the window of a craft store in the early 1970s, her life took a turn and she developed a new lifelong hobby. “It looked like black marble with a picture in the marble,” Aversa said. “It’s scratch carving. You dye eggs with natural dye like onion skins… use an exacto knife and cut a design into the egg. The cutting takes the dye away.” She signed up for an egg art class and has been creating egg art since. “Once I took the class, I was hooked,” she said. She fondly remembers her first egg creation. “It was a two-door jewel box. It’s absolutely hideous, but I keep it,” she said. She then followed that class with an oil painting on eggs class, where she met friends who are still friends today. Aversa created more than 80 eggs, taught classes for 15 years in egg art and won a multitude of ribbons. She was featured in magazines and accepted two international awards. She was invited three times to be one of the two United States representatives to the Randstad Foundation International Egg Exhibition in the Netherlands, where she twice received the sole international award, which was selected by popular vote. Aversa’s eggs are varied. Some have individually placed Swarovski stones, others have shells cut away with a dental drill while others are adorned with hand-painted paper flowers, dried kale or fungus. Music boxes and jewelry boxes are among the mix. “Most people have a specific type of egg. I’m known as the creative one because I don’t have a specific style,” she said. “Most of mine have to do with animals because that is my passion.” Aversa said she can spend up to six months creating one egg. “I have all these ideas in my head. It’s just a matter of working it out,” she said. “The possibilities are limitless.” Although Aversa no longer travels to share her skill, she does help friends interested in the art. Also, she currently has an egg under construction.",

    "LabBody": "The Midland Chamber of Commerce has received its national accreditation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Chamber officials announced the accreditation at an event Tuesday. The Chamber board has worked closely with the staff since last fall to achieve this milestone. Though more than 7,000 chambers of commerce exist in the U.S., only 3 percent (just more than 200 chambers) are accredited. This achievement highlights the Chamber’s dedication and commitment to be the best resource possible for Midland’s business community. “In 2014, our board of directors worked diligently to develop a strategic plan for the organization. This document gives a clear framework to achieve the Midland Chamber’s vision of, ‘Creating the best business climate on the planet,’” President and CEO Bobby Burns said. “To further our mission, the board has been invaluable in guiding our chamber to examine all areas of our programs and events. This, in turn, allowed us to pursue accreditation. We are pleased to announce that we are now a member of such a small and prestigious group.” Accreditation is the only national program that recognizes chambers for their effective organizational procedures and community involvement. To receive accreditation, a chamber must meet minimum standards in their operations and programs, including areas of governance, government affairs and technology. This extensive self-review can take six to nine months to complete.",

    "LabBody": "Repair work on the bridge that connects Southwest Morris Avenue with 26th Street is set to begin Monday. The city is replacing the bridge because its timber structure is rotting, said Josh Tacchini, project manager for the city of Corvallis' Public Works Department. The timbers will be replaced by pre-cut concrete slabs and the roadbed will be redone in a project that will cost $1.3 million. Nearly 90 percent of the money comes from an Oregon Department of Transportation grant, with the city required to match the remaining 10 percent from its street fund. The work will force the closure of Morris at 26th for the duration of the project. Morris Avenue traffic will be routed onto Grove Street and from there to Western Boulevard. Travel lanes will be shifted on 26th during most of the construction but two-way travel will be maintained. At times there will be just one northbound lane available with a detour routing southbound traffic via 15th Street and Western to Philomath Boulevard. Residents will receive 48-hour notice before any driveway closures, Tacchini said. Access to residences will be restored at the end of each working day and on weekends. Business access within the project area will remain available. The current bridge has a weight limit of 10 tons. The new bridge will not have load restrictions and also will include bike lanes and a sidewalk for pedestrians. The bridge reconstruction project is scheduled to be completed Sept. 25, with bridge rail and landscaping work continuing into late October. School at nearby Oregon State University begins Sept. 24. “It’s not ideal to be ending when we are ending,” said Tacchini, who noted that because the original project cost estimate of $900,000 grew to $1.3 million, an ODOT review was required that delayed the start of work by four weeks. The construction work will be continuing during the first two OSU home football games at Reser Stadium on Sept. 4 and Sept. 19, with a third game set for Sept. 25. Tacchini noted that because 26th Street is closed on game days the project should have minimal impact on football traffic or congestion.

    "LabBody": "It has been amusing to watch the brands — the PGA, NBC, Macy’s, NASCAR, Univision, Serta — flee Donald Trump after his xenophobic remarks. Who even knew the Donald had a line of mattresses featuring Cool Action Dual Effects Gel Memory Foam? But there is one entity that can’t dump Trump, no matter how hard it tries: the GOP, because Trump is the Republican Party. One big Republican donor this week floated to the Associated Press the idea of having candidates boycott debates if the tycoon is onstage. Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham and other candidates have lined up to say, as Rick Perry put it, that “Donald Trump does not represent the Republican Party.” But Trump has merely held up a mirror to the GOP. The man, long experience has shown, believes in nothing other than himself. He has, conveniently, selected the issues that Republicans want to hear about — or at least a significant proportion of Republican primary voters. He may be saying things more colorfully than others when he talks about Mexico sending rapists across the border, but his views show that, far from being an outlier, he is hitting all the erogenous zones of the GOP electorate. Anti-immigrant? Against Common Core education standards? For repealing Obamacare? Against same-sex marriage? Anti-abortion? Anti-tax? Anti-China? Virulent in questioning President Obama’s legitimacy? Check, check, check, check, check, check, check and check. Does anybody suppose Trump really cares about illegal immigration (which helps his construction interests by suppressing wages) or about defending traditional marriage (he’s had three)? And we don’t need to suppose: We can look back at what he did and said in 1999, when he was flirting with a run for the Reform Party presidential nomination and I accompanied him on a swing through Southern California. I flew on his 727 with the winged “T” on the tail and the mirrored headboard on the bed, and I learned all about his prospective platform: progressive on social issues such as gays in the military, for campaign finance reform and universal health care, in favor of more regulation, opposed to investing Social Security money in the stock market. Most of all, he preached tolerance — contrasting himself with Pat Buchanan, his rival for the nomination, who had made statements considered anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant. Buchanan at the time had been talking about criminals entering illegally from Mexico. He said other politicians were afraid that “if they speak out against illegal immigration and they speak out against the crimes that are being committed, suddenly they’ll be considered insensitive, or they say, ‘We might lose the Hispanic vote.’” Trump back then issued a statement saying he hates intolerance because in New York, “a town with different races, religions and peoples, I have learned to work with my brother man.” I accompanied him as he underscored the point by touring the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. “He seems to be a racist,” Trump said of Buchanan. Now Trump is the one talking about Mexico sending us drugs, crime and rapists. His shift is hardly surprising given his audience — and his competitors. Scott Walker talks about self-deportation, Graham talks about ending birthright citizenship, Ben Carson blames illegal immigrants in part for the measles outbreak, Rand Paul describes as lawbreakers those who were brought to the United States illegally as children, and even relatively moderate candidates such as Bush and Marco Rubio have hardened their immigration positions. Ted Cruz actually praised Trump. Trump’s position also closely follows those that came from Arizona in 2010 when then-Gov. Jan Brewer and other Republicans attempted an immigration crackdown. They spoke about illegal immigrants on the border as a source of beheadings, kidnappings and police killings. The previously tolerant Trump may be a phony, but he’s no dope: He recognized that his name recognition would take him far if he merely voiced, in his bombastic style, the positions GOP voters craved. The mogul’s broader basket of issues is also in tune with those of a slate of candidates who have compared homosexuality to alcoholism (Perry), likened union protesters to the Islamic State (Walker) and proposed elections for Supreme Court justices (Cruz), and who virtually all oppose same-sex marriage and action on climate change. It worked. Trump placed second in national polls by Fox News and CNN, virtually guaranteeing him a place in the first debate, on Aug. 6 — unless the GOP persuades Fox News, the host, to dump Trump. That would be hard to justify. Trump may be a monster, but he’s the monster Republicans created.",

    "LabBody": "Archbishop Bernard Hebda, in his first public interviews, said Friday that his priority during his temporary stay in the Twin Cities is to tackle legal issues such as the bankruptcy and clergy abuse lawsuits confronting the St. Paul and Minneapolis archdiocese. He also is considering the growing demands to release an internal investigation into reports of sexual misconduct by former Archbishop John Nienstedt. That investigation was conducted last year but never made public. “I certainly recognize there is a great interest there, and it would be difficult for the archdiocese to move forward without really considering carefully how we might be able to give an accounting of what’s been going on,” said Hebda. Hebda, the coadjutor archbishop in Newark, N.J., arrived in Minnesota this week following his appointment as temporary administrator of the Twin Cities archdiocese. He replaces Nienstedt, who resigned June 15 shortly after the Ramsey County attorney filed a lawsuit against the archdiocese charging “failure to protect children.” Hebda will meet worshipers and celebrate his first mass at the St. Paul Cathedral at 10 a.m. Sunday. Hebda said his biggest challenge is to quickly absorb a lot information. He’s getting a crash course in church finance, clergy abuse litigation, the Nienstedt investigation and the general running and staffing of the archdiocese. “As coadjutor in Newark, I had a long time to come to know the people before I had to make decisions,” said Hebda, sitting in the St. Paul chancery that he’d never set foot in until this week. “Here, I’m jumping in midstream and there’s a lot to do right away. It really is a challenge to come up to speed, to come to know all the people involved in the archdiocese, the gifts and skills they have to help us move forward.” As the newcomer, he wants to make sure he is well-informed, effective, and doesn’t “make decisions now that I’ll regret later.” Hebda, who has been criticized by clergy abuse victims in Newark for not being a visible force for reform there, said he has no plans to meet with Minnesota clergy abuse survivors at this time. “I don’t know if they want to talk to someone who will be here a few months, but at the same time, I would be open to doing that,” he said. The archbishop, whose résumé includes 13 years working in Rome, speculated that the Vatican would appoint a permanent archbishop within a year. Just don’t expect a ton of activity on the appointment this summer, he warned. “The Italian tradition is for everyone to take a month off in the summer,” he explained. “I can’t imagine much will be done in July or August.” He’s getting ‘a lot of advice’ Hebda, 55, is a Pittsburgh native. He seemed surprised that Twin Cities faithful have not been shy about contacting him, including urging him to release the findings of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Nienstedt over the years. “I am getting a lot of mail,” he said. “I’m receiving a lot of prayers, a lot of advice … a lot of invitations.” His background includes a law degree from Columbia University and a canon law degree from Rome. He acknowledged that the law degree could be helpful as he deals with the archdiocese’s many legal troubles. But he stressed he hasn’t practiced law in 30 years and that he is only a member of the bar association in Pennsylvania, joking, “It will be malpractice for me to practice law here.” A surprise move for him. The move to St. Paul has created an abrupt lifestyle shift for Hebda, accustomed to a lower profile in Newark, where he is slated to replace retiring Archbishop John J. Myers next July. He fully expected to stay focused on Newark until then, meeting Catholic leaders and preparing the transition. He said he was in “absolute shock” when the Vatican asked him to become temporary archbishop in the Twin Cities. First, he had no idea that Nienstedt would be leaving, he said. Second, he already had a job. But in the same “spirit of trust” that he accepted the job in Newark, he accepted his second job in St. Paul, he said. Until a permanent archbishop is named, he will divide his time between Minnesota and New Jersey. He had never set foot in Minnesota, except for its airport, and said he’s been surprised by “the beauty of the area.” In the weeks ahead, he will continue meeting with staff, department heads, attorneys, finance directors and more to provide temporary guidance to one of the most troubled archdioceses in the nation. He said he’s been impressed by the people he’s met. Said Hebda: “I sense a real commitment to the church and to get beyond the difficulties of the day.”",

Bradley Denny finished the game 3 for 3 at the plate with a double and two runs scored for the Renegades in addition to throwing five innings on the mound. Denny allowed just two earned runs while striking out four. Joe Mesa was stuck with the loss after throwing seven innings for the Curve, allowing three earned runs. Mesa recorded two hits, as did Colby Douglas, Tyler David, David Ruiz and Mark Mesa. Douglas and David also crossed home plate for two runs apiece. The Curve loaded the bases in the ninth, but saw their comeback attempt end there. Tengu (4-2) kept pace with the Renegades, topping the Blue Sox (3-3) 9-5 thanks to Johnny Dio and Andrew Dell's performances at the plate. Dio finished the game 4 for 4 with a run scored and Dell went 2 for 2 with a walk and three RBIs. Carl Conway earned the win for Tengu, pitching five innings. The Blue Sox jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning and worked out of a bases-loaded jam to keep control of the game. However, Tengu struck for three runs in the second and five more in the fourth while Conway gained control on the mound. Dave Pogue recorded a double and a run scored, and Dan Riggs went 2 for 3 with a run scored for the Blue Sox. Facing off with the league's other one-win team, the RedSox (1-5) earned their first victory over the season against Sportmans (1-4-1) in a 10-9 final. Patrick Conditt threw six innings for the victory and was backed by Jesus Rodriguez's four RBIs. CJ Hunt went 3 for 3 with three steals and four runs scored while Billy Coscia and Eric Schauss each added two hits. After the week off for the Fourth of July holiday, teams return to the field on Sunday, continueing to play all games at Sinagua Middle School.

    "LabBody": "Ariana Grande has followed up her written statement in regard to her controversial trip to a California doughnut shop over Fourth of July weekend with an apology video. The actress was caught on film at the Wolfee Donut Shop in Lake Elsinore, Calif., on Saturday with one of her backup dancers, and she appeared to lick a couple of the doughnuts put on display while staff members weren't watching, and then she could be heard saying \"I hate America.\" The Nickelodeon star-turned singer said in a statement, \"I am EXTREMELY proud to be an American and I've always made it clear that I love my country. What I said in a private moment with my friend, who was buying the donuts, was taken out of context and I am sorry for not using more discretion with my choice of words.\" She went on to add that she's an \"advocate for healthy eating\" and her words came out of frustration because we \"need to demand more from our food industry\" when it comes to healthier eating options. Grande's apology wasn't exactly well-received though, prompting another backlash from fans and fellow stars, including Rob Lowe, who who mocked her apology on twitter. \"As my grandpa would say: 'Yeah, sure. Pull the other leg, it plays jingle bells!' #Lame,\" he wrote; adding, \"Cannot wait for the new Arianna (sic) Grande/Dixie Chicks jam to drop!\" Ariana has now taken to the webcam to film a message for YouTube, even doing so after having her wisdom teeth pulled. \"Hiya it's me. Forgive my puffy cheeks please, I'm making this video from wisdom teeth recovery hell,\" the Problem singer said. \"But I just wanted to make a video to apologize again for the whole doughnut fiasco and craziness because I feel like the apology I posted, I kind of missed my opportunity to actually sincerely apologize and express how I was feeling, because I was too busy preaching about my issues with the food industry, which is not, I feel like, relative.\" Grande says that she's actually \"never been prouder to be an American\" because of all of \"the advances we've made in the past couple months\" and that seeing herself caught on video was a \"rude awakening\" for her. \"I was so disgusted with myself, I like wanted to shove my face into a pillow and like disappear, but instead of that I'm going to come forward and own up to what I did and take responsibility and say I'm sorry because I reacted in a way that I feel like wasn't necessary to say the least but also just wasn't me at all,\" she says. \"I've still got a lot to learn and I'll make mistakes and that's how I'm gonna learn. I'm gonna learn from my mistakes and I'm gonna learn from messing up.\" Naturally, this apology isn't enough for some either, as she's been blasted yet again for failing to mention Wolfee Donuts and apologize for her behavior in the store. Perhaps accepting peoples' apologies for things is one of those \"advances\" this country still has yet to make.",

What’s Happening: The Error on Dylann Roof's Background Check The .45 pistol that Dylann Roof used to kill nine people in a Charleston church last month was widely thought to be legally bought. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that a background check should have prevented Roof from purchasing his weapon. Roof had been charged earlier in the year for unlawful use of a controlled substance, which would have barred him from buying a gun. As David Graham notes in The Atlantic, “it seems the problem is just a failure in the system.” Fallout from the federal hack: Katherine Archuleta resigned as the director of the Office of Personnel Management on Friday. She stepped down just one day after it was revealed that hackers compromised the sensitive data of over 21 million Americans. When the cyberbreach was first reported in June, only 4 million Americans, mostly government workers and contractors, were thought to be affected.

We bore and burn out easily—particularly, it seems, when it comes to fitness.” Christopher Orr: “There’s plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted, and the minions themselves are consistently amusing...

The core idea of the emerging Jeb Bush economic policy is that a bigger Gross Domestic Product will translate into more opportunity and higher wages for the average person. Over the past generation, however, rising GDP has not always improved living standards. A close look at the period in the past 40 years when living standards did improve, in the second half of the 1990s, reveals that the improvement was driven by a (temporary) pause in healthcare cost inflation. When the cost of employee benefits rises more slowly, employee pay can rise more quickly. The tragedy of the American workplace is that employers continue to pay more for labor—but workers don’t receive that money. It is siphoned off by the healthcare industry.

There are several Olympic-style events for man's best friend to compete in, and some will qualify to move on to the finals in St. Louis on September 25 and 26. \"It's a great way for them to come together and have a friendly competition,\" Jim Allen, Purina Pro Plan brand manager said. This is the first time the Incredible Dog Challenge has come to Boston, where it will be held at Joe Moakley Park on Friday, July 10 and Saturday, July 11. The Western Regional Competition was held in Huntington Beach, California in May. According to Allen, who has worked with the competition since its start, they try to bring it to new cities each year, but have not taken it any farther northeast than New York City, until this year. The competition began as a marketing event for a Purina Dog Chow advertising campaign, and has stood the test of time, becoming one of the longest running dog-specific programs on television. Now, the event attracts dog athletes from cities all over the country to compete in events like high flying disc, weave pole racing, agility, Jack Russel hurdling, and the crowd pleasing, diving dog. (The diving dog challenge consists of the dogs taking a running leap off of a 40 foot dock into a 19,000 gallon pool.) The competition is for dogs of all ages, sizes and breeds, and it gives local dogs the chance to compete in the open qualifying rounds on July 10. Those who qualify will earn a spot in Saturday's main event. However, each event is limited to a certain number of competitors, so if a local dog wants to participate they should get to the qualifying registration as early as possible. There are 20 dogs competing in the qualifying round of dog diving, 15 in the flying disc competition and eight in the freestyle fetch competition. At least the top two winners from each challenge will move on to the finals in St. Louis, which will air on NBC in January. Allen said in the 18 years of the event, a cash prize has never been given out. Instead, winners receive a medal, bragging rights and their 15 minutes of fame on national television. \"It's always been a friendly fun thing to do with dogs,\" he said. IF YOU GO What: Purina Pro Plan Incredible Dog Challenge - Eastern Regional Event. When: Friday, qualifying rounds beginning at 9 a.m. Saturday, competition from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Where: Joe Moakley Park, 1005 Columbia Road, Boston. Admission: The event is free and open to the public. For more information go to incredibledogchallenge.com.",

    "LabBody": "An environmental group is suing a local metal recycling facility it accuses of polluting local waterways, court records show. Clean Water Action filed the civil suit against Framingham Salvage Co. in U.S. District Court on Monday. The Boston-based advocacy organization is seeking a court order that stops the company from releasing pollutants into nearby water sources; forces it to restore the allegedly damaged water bodies; and requires it to pay civil penalties for violations. On Tuesday, however, both sides said they were already working together to reach a resolution on those issues. According to a copy of the suit, Clean Water Action claims the 120 Waverly St. scrap metal recycling yard has been discharging stormwater runoff into the town’s municipal storm drain system and into Beaverdam Brook, “the largest tributary of Lake Cochituate.” The organization specifically claims that runoff contains levels of aluminum, copper and zinc that exceed what’s allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency under the facility’s stormwater permit. In excessive amounts, those metals “are toxic to fish, aquatic plants, and other aquatic life,” the suit says, and “may also be hazardous to human life if they enter the water supply.\" The runoff also had higher than allowed levels of iron, which can also be harmful to water-dwelling organisms and cause “aesthetically objectionable conditions in water bodies by making the water appear rust colored,” Clean Water Action said. Framingham Salvage’s attorney, David Rosenblatt, declined to talk about the specific claims in the suit, but said the company has not had any problems with environmental compliance. “The company takes its environmental responsibility very seriously,” he said. “They’re working with Clean Water Action to reach a resolution on this matter, and expect they will do so.” Becky Smith, campaigns director for Clean Water Action's Massachusetts division, also said the sides were communicating with each other in the hopes of resolving the organization's issues. \"Hopefully in the end, what that looks like is the company comes into compliance,\" she said. Smith said Clean Water Action targeted Framingham Salvage as part of a statewide citizen enforcement campaign aimed at uncovering violators of the EPA's water regulations. The organization has filed lawsuits against several other companies as well as a result of that effort, she said. In a letter to the company last September, Clean Water Action’s New England regional co-director, Cindy Luppi, and the organization’s lawyer, Nora Chorover, said Framingham Salvage “has had a pattern of exceeding EPA benchmark limits” for regulated metals since the company submitted a notice of intent to the agency for a stormwater permit in 2012. In particular, the lawsuit claims heavy machinery and processing equipment kept at the Waverly Road facility have leaked oil, diesel fuel and other contaminants, which are washed into local waterways during storms. The EPA's online database as of Tuesday showed the company had no violations during the agency's last inspection in 2010, and that subsequent compliance monitoring the past three years also yielded no violations. But several categories on Framingham Salvage's facility report page in the database also say \"no data returned,\" including two categories related to tracking releases of pollutants.

    "LabBody": "COLUMBIA — Not much has happened at the Central Missouri Events Center in 2015. The 129 acres on the east side of North Oakland Gravel Road, which some just call \"the fairgrounds,\" was closed Jan. 1 after Boone County voters in August rejected, by a 2-1 margin, a proposed sales tax to keep it operating . The only event on the calendar is the Boone County Fair, which begins July 21. But after the annual celebration concludes July 25, it's back to lack of business as usual for the site, whose tenants include storage containers, unused utility hookups, vacant buildings and empty fields. On Wednesday morning, the gloomy expanse seemed an unlikely and unwelcoming sort of venue for merriment and camping, let alone business. Yet the fairgrounds played host to a meeting of a county commissioner, a former Missouri governor, the mayor of Columbia and four other prominent county residents, whose job it will be to suggest development options for the property. The Central Missouri Events Center Review Committee held its first public meeting inside a conference room at the Coliseum. Seated beneath a rotting ceiling tile, Boone County Presiding Commissioner Dan Atwill told the group it should look at what has worked at similar facilities around the country, such as the Independence Events Center in Missouri. Atwill said he handpicked six additional members of the committee. Besides brainstorming ways to make money for the fairgrounds, Atwill said, there's the perception of government inactivity, rumblings that the county owns the property \"and we're not doing anything with it.\" \"I'm concerned about that,\" Atwill said Tuesday. \"We've got to make some decisions.\" Former Missouri Gov. Roger Wilson said the city and county would have to work together to find a solution amid upcoming \"explosive\" growth in Boone County. Columbia Mayor Bob McDavid said that while the city was glad to be involved, it has no expertise in operating such a facility. He added that there was no room for events center funding on the city's park sales tax, which voters will decide whether to renew in August. The committee is expected to present its recommendations to the County Commission, Atwill said, though there's no deadline. His hope is that the property's development and funding will be based in part on the committee's advice. A tour of the grounds was planned, going from the Coliseum past the open fields to the Atkins Park Baseball Complex. Atwill commandeered a Sheriff's Department paddy wagon for the occasion, but the tour was washed out by the rain. The weather did help, Atwill said, to identify at least eight leaks in the Coliseum's roof. In a precursor to explaining the need for funding, he estimated the cost of repairing the roof alone to be about $500,000. Atwill said plans to develop the events center have been mired since the August defeat of Proposition EPIC, a proposed one-eighth-cent sales tax for the fairground. Without the additional tax revenues, the county never prepared a development plan. \"It was just a circular dilemma,\" he said. \"No money, no plan. No plan, no vote.\" Asked how much the fairgrounds was worth, Atwill replied: \"Who knows? It hasn't been appraised.\" He said there were no plans for an appraisal, adding that after talking with county Assessor Tom Schauwecker, Atwill estimated the land might be worth twice the $2.4 million the county paid for it in 1999. A better set of circumstances — more public interest, more money — could allow the fairgrounds to be patterned after facilities in Independence or in Overland Park, Kansas. Atwill suggested the group take a trip west to look at those facilities in hopes of generating ideas for Boone County. The Columbia Convention and Visitors Bureau released a report in November recommending the city create a sports field complex at the fairgrounds. Besides adding fields and bleachers to the Atkins Park Baseball Complex, which the city and county jointly own, the report recommends redeveloping land on or near the events center, including \"at least 12 competitive-caliber soccer fields with artificial turf,\" lights, concession stands and locker rooms at the fairgrounds. The report estimated the total cost of such a project at about $16.5 million, with the soccer fields and accompanying facilities to cost about $14 million combined. It said the events center was \"a financial burden for the county\" and noted \"a severe lack of both practice fields and tournament-caliber venues for a wide variety of field sports.\" Amy Schneider, the bureau's director, spoke on the importance of tourism to the region. She said tourism was the second-largest industry in Missouri, behind agriculture. Atwill pointed at a map to indicate a strip of land at the fairgrounds near U.S 63 that had been identified as a possible location for hotels and restaurants. Schneider's presentation led to a discussion of how the events center could increase tourism. McDavid said the city is looking to increase its 4 percent hotel tax to 7 percent, which would put Columbia in line with St. Louis, Kansas City and Jefferson City. McDavid said the city plans to put a 5 percent hotel tax before voters within a year. He'd like it to be even higher, he said, but efforts to lobby the state to allow Columbia's tax to exceed 5 percent were unsuccessful. \"Help us get 7 percent,\" McDavid said to Atwill, and \"I'm certain we could contribute some of that to whatever endeavor we come up with.\" Besides being the father of former Hickman High School basketball standout Jimmy Whitt, James Whitt coaches basketball and organizes two tournaments in Columbia each year. He said that such tournaments can lead to increased hotel revenue when out-of-state teams participate and spoke approvingly of building a multisport facility at the events center. Atwill said the demolition derby venue could be repurposed as an office to manage the soccer and baseball fields. Again, though, the problem of funding looms large. And there's still the matter of the county fair. While the group studied a map of the grounds, regional Commerce Bank President Teresa Maledy asked if anyone knew the minimum amount of space needed for the county fair. Boone County Fair Board members Jeff Cook, David Grant and Dane Chandler were present at the meeting, and board president Cook introduced himself as he walked to the map. Cook said that with youth shows, carnival attractions and animal expositions, the fair is spread across the land, and he acknowledged that the set-up for the fair could be more efficient. He said the fair is important for reasons besides making money, describing it as a \"vacation for 4-H kids\" who camped out for the duration. He told the members of the committee that he was \"very disappointed\" to hear so much talk of athletic venues and nothing about children who participate in 4-H or FFA. \"Not all kids play sports,\" Cook said. \"Don't forget about our 4-H kids. ... You're killing the agriculture kids. It's just ... it's very heartbreaking.\" Cook said that he's fine with adding soccer fields but asked the committee not to overlook the agricultural community: \"Don't forget about us.\" Cook will be speaking at a noon Muleskinners meeting Friday at the Columbia Country Club. He said that while his topic is the past, present and future of the county fair, he is \"focusing on the past because we don't know what our future is.\" While he reiterated his belief that \"sports are great,\" he added that there are many more types of events that could call the fair home: horse shows, dog shows, motorcycle displays, cattle shows, gun shows and 4-H art exhibits. Wilson complimented Cook and the fair board on their time and effort, and he told Cook not to feel disheartened. Wilson said there is \"another line of intent\" to involve agricultural interests — it just hadn't come up in conversation yet. After the meeting adjourned, the fair board members gathered by the indoor arena that would soon host a mule show, a dog show and a pony pull. Wilson joined them briefly, whispering to Cook, Grant and Chandler, who listened closely. Whitt said that the \"public needs to buy into\" any development at the events center, and former MU Athletics Director Mike Alden agreed, saying that the more public input and transparency, the better for all. In November 2013, a similar group — known as the \"Central Missouri Events Center Task Force\" — delivered a report to the County Commission. That group, which was chaired by Wilson, noted that the fairgrounds was \"repeatedly described as a gem, jewel or diamond in the rough\" but found the property needed a full-time manager, full-time marketer and additional revenue sources — whether public, private or facility-generated. \"There's an answer to this problem,\" Atwill said on Tuesday. \"I don't know what it is, but there's got to be an answer. And you're never going to find it if you don't look.\" Supervising editor is John Schneller.",

    "LabBody": "Season 2 of Extant premiered just last week with a few changes. At Comic-Con on Thursday, two of its stars -- Halle Berry and Jeffrey Dean Morgan -- and the executive producers sat down to gab about what fans can look forward to on the rebooted drama. Berry quickly recapped what happened to her character Molly in Season 1: She adopted a robot, went to space, and got impregnated by an alien. Then it turned out her alien son aged super fast. Then he died, and then the robot son got taken away, and then her husband got hit by a train. Then she got committed to, and subsequently escaped from, a mental hospital. This season has lots of fun stuff coming: It turns out her alien son isn't dead! But more importantly, Jeffrey Dean Morgan will be there. Morgan said his character, JD Richter, a cop investigating a series of mysterious deaths, and Molly \"meet at a crime scene and sparks fly.\" Berry said she was excited to have a man interested in her character. \"Finally, a man that wanted to kiss me! My husband last season didn't want to come near me,\" she said. Executive producer Craig Shapiro said they were excited to see the chemistry between Berry and Morgan, saying it \"fizzes\" on screen. \"Jeffrey and I do swap fluids,\" Berry teased. \"You gotta wait for it!\" Also something to look forward to: A kick-ass fight scene in the finale. Shapiro wouldn't say who Molly fights, but promised \"it's an amazing fight scene to wrap up the season.\" Berry also briefly touched on why she went from a successful movie career to television. \"I felt like, TV is the new frontier,\" Berry said. \"The best writing is on television. There are great characters for women and women like me, my age group, my ethnicity, and I felt like to go do some quality work, which I was finding hard to do in the film world, I would go to TV. ... Television is where it's at right now.\" Extant airs on Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS. Page 2 of 2 - (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)

    "DiffbotBody": "Uber and Lyft have taken to prices slashes in Manhattan as they continue to fight. The battleground of the ride-hailing war has now moved from San Francisco to Manhattan. On Friday, bitter rivals Uber and Lyft, both of which offer on-demand rides with the tap of a mobile app, announced price slashes to their carpooling services in Manhattan. So, if you’re looking for a ride and don’t want to grab a taxi, here are your options: UberPool: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan, as long as it starts and ends south of 96th Street, and it will cost $10 at most (or less if the distance doesn’t reach $10 per Uber’s fare math), and regardless of whether you get matched to carpool with another rider. Uber says this is for a limited time, so keep an eye out for announcements in case it changes. Lyft Line: Riders can get a trip anywhere in Manhattan as long as it starts and ends south of 97th Street (note the extra block), and it will cost only $5 even if you’re not matched with another carpooler. The catch is that this only works for one rider. If you are with a friend, you will be charged $1 dollar for both of you to get into the car. Gett: This Israeli car service contender has been quieter than Uber and Lyft, but it’s been offering $10 rides anywhere in Manhattan south of 110th Street since last September. Oh, and you don’t have to carpool and you get to ride in a fancy black car. Uber and Lyft have been running this playbook in San Francisco for several months now, and prices have fluctuated. Manhattanites should expect these deals to be temporary. New York’s city council is also expected to consider a proposal that would halt these services’ expansion by capping the number of cars they can add every year, so any of the above could be affected. Lyft recently agreed to pay $300,000 to settle a city complaint. At least New York still has a pretty good subway system…",

    "LabBody": "NEW YORK — Magic doesn't just happen like, well, magic. That's a major message of Penn and Teller, who for 40 years have plied their trade as sassy secularists in the priesthood of magicians, doing everything they can to undermine their brethren's baton-and-black-cape mystique. For them, magic isn't voodoo. It's an acquired skill that they — peerless in its acquisition — are exhibiting at Broadway's Marquis Theatre starting Tuesday for a six-weeks-only gig through Aug. 16. Drawing on their long association and their dozen-years-running engagement on the Las Vegas strip, \"Penn \u0026 Teller on Broadway\" is a bag of tricks that range from their first months together to illusions unveiled only weeks ago. But Penn and Teller aren't out to \"trick\" you (they say people don't like getting tricked) as much as challenge your perceptions. \"It's all about contrasting what your senses are telling you with what your experience is telling you,\" says Teller, the single-monickered silent partner, who in person is loquacious. \"You already know everything you need to know about the mysteries that we're doing. We're just placing that information in ways you have trouble accessing.\" \"It's so much more interesting that way,\" pipes up Penn Jillette, Teller's outspoken, towering other half. \"For a magician to claim that what they're doing is supernatural is either an attempt to bamboozle you, or it's simply lying. We say, 'We learned to do these tricks, and these tricks let us play around with how you ascertain what's true.' That way, we're working with the audience to think about this stuff.\" And also make the audience laugh. The pair use comedy to play against the traditional pretensions of stage magic. They are both devout rationalists. No wonder their act is irreverent, even subversive, down to the comic illusion that Teller is a peewee. Which he is, but, inasmuch as he stands 5-foot-8, only when observed alongside Penn, a hefty 6-foot-7. Interviewed recently in a production office in midtown Manhattan, they are pleased to note that, parting company with typical magicians, they don't waste the audience's time with lofty buildups for each trick. \"I worked silent before I ever knew Penn,\" says the 67-year-old Teller (who, lest there be any doubt about his name's singularity, shares with a reporter a couple of credit cards and his driver's license, which all say simply, Teller). \"It was partly a rebellion against magicians' patter because anything I'd ever heard in a magic act was really stupid.\" So onstage Penn, 60, does all the talking. He plays the dominating provocateur, with Teller his mischievous accomplice. By now they have three or four hours of magic in their active repertoire, \"and there's always two or three new ideas in the pipeline,\" says Teller. But R\u0026D for each new trick can take anywhere from six months to six years. \"I think people have a hard time imagining how many blind alleys we go down, at a hundred miles an hour,\" says Penn. \"It's not like playing a new song on the guitar,\" says Teller. \"We have to do the equivalent of inventing the guitar, then learning to play it, then writing the composition for it, then performing that song.\" For their Broadway show, Penn and Teller are presenting one trick whose gestation — 6 1/2 years — is a record for them. \"We vanish an African Spotted Pygmy Elephant,\" says Penn, wearing a devilish smile. \"Some say the elephant we use is just a cow dressed up. There are those who will say the trunk is just a drier hose strapped onto a feed bag of a cow. Some say it's silly. But I think it may be the most amazing trick you've ever seen.\" For all the amazingness of the results, their brainstorming sessions sound strictly workaday. \"We meet at Starbucks on Tuesday afternoons for two or three hours and we just talk,\" says Teller. \"Out of those conversations, things come — even things, like half-a-trick we couldn't make work before, that we finally resurrected from conversations we had 30 years ago.\" One trick resulted not from coffee at Starbucks. \"I believe we were having tea,\" Penn reminds Teller, \"and you began singing 'I'm a Little Teapot.' I said, 'That would be a great trick.'\" \"In the trick, Penn sings the song and I play the teapot,\" says Teller, \"and he picks me up by my elbow — my 'handle' — and he pours a cup of tea out of me. It's a really hard trick. I don't remember how long that took us to work out.\" \"At least two years,\" says Penn. \"The audience is misdirected by the fact that it's profoundly silly,\" says Teller. \"Then the second reaction is: That's impossible!\" That's their magic twofer.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "What is the key to a successful marriage? Here's the secret: there are no secrets! However, there are some rules; rules that couples are ignorantly unaware of, or intentionally ignore. But when paid attention to, these rules result in long-lasting and happy marriages. Your spouse is not your roommate. I think every couple goes through \"the roommate phase\" every once in a while during their marriage. When this happens, the key is to intentionally notice the lack of spark...and light it again. It's easy to let life get in the way of your romance. When that happens, put life to the side for a moment, and show your spouse why you're more than just roommates. Marriage is not 50/50. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Marriage is not give and take. It's give and give, on BOTH sides. If you only give half of what you expect in a marriage, you will come up short-handed every time. Wives, you should be giving all you have to your husband. And husbands, you need to give all you have to your wife. Together you are one. Give everything and expect nothing. Mistakes are ok. Despite what you may read in fairy tales or see on Facebook, no marriage is perfect. Your spouse will inevitably make mistakes, and so will you. The key is to own up to those mistakes and try your best not to make them again. Patience, understanding, and forgiveness are fundamental to having a great marriage. Learn to speak your spouse's love language. Know what the five love languages are. Even if you have read the book and know what love language your spouse speaks, it's easy to forget and automatically go back to speaking your own. My love language is quality time. So for me, it feels natural to show my husband I love him by just spending time with him. But he doesn't feel loved that way. I need to make a conscious effort to speak HIS love language, especially when it's completely different than my own. Marriage is not about you. If you are constantly asking yourself, \"What's in this for me?\" you've got marriage all wrong. Men and women have needs that are almost completely different, yet both sides are crucial for a happy marriage. Perhaps your spouse isn't fulfilling your needs. Instead of dwelling on their lack of effort, focus on how you can better fulfill their needs. They will be more likely to be mindful of yours. Sex is not a bargaining tool. Whether they realize it or not, some couples will say to each other, \"You get sex when I get what I want.\" Slowly but surely, that will destroy your marriage every time. Sex should be a priority and valued highly as a couple. When you treat it as such, your relationship will surely be strengthened. True love isn't just about romance. I'll never forget the butterflies in my stomach or the fast-paced beat of my heart when I was dating my husband. Luckily, I still feel those things many years later. But the longer I have been married, the more I learn about what love actually means. Love isn't about those feelings. It's about commitment. It's about service. It's about hard work. Love is about believing the best in each other and doubting the rest. Happily married or not, every couple can benefit from following these marriage rules. A successful marriage is an accumulation of the simple things. But you have to do the simple things each and every day of your life together to make it work.",

West Texas VA Health Care System Director Michael Kiefer will present “Homeless Veteran Summit.” Services available at the fair include medical services and screening, haircuts, counseling services and referrals, VA clinic information and employment assistance. Barillaro and others from Redcon-1 Music Group will perform at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Though inspired by country artists who have released military-centered songs, Barillaro said his music style differs in more than just genre. “The country music genre proves that patriotic music lives so I could do it with hip-hop,” he said. “The only difference between mine and theirs is, as patriotic as theirs is, I’m speaking as an artist who actually lived it.” Barillaro doesn’t glorify his experience; he’s open about the difficulty of readjusting to life at home and living with post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. He started writing songs as a form of therapy to help deal with PTSD. “I was reading an article about music therapy and I was like, ‘I’m going to start making songs that will help me as a form of therapy,’” he said. He wrote about PTSD — his recurring nightmares and inability to sleep — and found that his songs were also therapeutic to other veterans. “I could actually help other people,” he said. “Now, that’s what I’m doing on a consistent basis is helping other veterans through music.” One of Barillaro’s songs addresses high rates of veteran suicide and asks veterans and their friends and family to watch out for “red flags.” In another, he writes a “break-up” letter to PTSD. Barillaro travels the country performing for veterans. After his Midland show he’s off to Boston and then Minnesota. His career path as a military hip-hop artist and veteran activist — though unplanned — is rewarding. “I have veterans who tell me my music has saved their lives,” he said. “Helping them helps me at the same time.

    "LabBody": "McLester “Mac” McDowell’s booming laughter is gone from the dining room of Anderson’s Emergency Kitchen, where he spent every day for two or three decades until his death last fall. It is clear that he is missed. A large framed photo of him hangs in the dining room, above what once was a fireplace in this house turned soup kitchen. A snapshot of him is still part of a collage of photos of the kitchen’s volunteers that decorate the serving room. Two newspaper articles, displayed in frames, contain photos with him in them. All the volunteers here remember him. Some are here working because of the man they called simply Lester. “I’m here because Lester asked me about volunteering up here,” Lonnie Smith said. “We both went to St. Paul Baptist Church then. I grew up in this neighborhood, so this is a way I can give back. For 10 years, Lester, Bobby and I were here every day, five days a week. We just miss his presence.” WANT TO HELP? Anderson’s Emergency Kitchen is suffering a bit from a slump in donations because of the busy summer season. They always accept any donations, of food or money. But in particular they need the following canned products: tuna, salmon, beef stew and vegetables.The kitchen is at 306 W. Franklin St., in Anderson. It is open 5 days a week from 9 a.m. until about noon. For more information, call 864-224-4763. McDowell died in October 2014 at age 85. For nearly 25 years, almost as long as the soup kitchen had been open, McDowell was a volunteer there. He was even the chairman of the soup kitchen’s board of directors for at least a decade, said current board member John Brown. “People still ask about Lester,” one of the volunteers said. But neither the mission of the soup kitchen nor its work has come to a halt because of McDowell’s absence, Brown said. Instead, because of McDowell, the charity’s mission has been strengthened. Because of him, at least four of seven volunteers present at the kitchen on Thursday were there as a result of McDowell reaching out to them in one way or another. “Nothing is the same without Lester,” said Ivy Davis, whose husband is Lester’s nephew. “He is why we are here,” said her husband, L.C. Davis. “Besides, none of us can carry all the burden, but we can share it.” And really, that is what Anderson’s Emergency Soup Kitchen has been about since it was founded. It has been an effort pulled together by community-minded people from the beginning. It has operated in a small, red-brick housenear downtown Anderson since the late 1980s. The kitchen was started by the efforts of community activist, Lila Albergotti, according to a history of Grace Episcopal Church. Albergotti was a Grace Episcopal member, and in 1982, in a period of high unemployment in the county, she approached the church’s governing body about providing a site for the soup kitchen. The church’s Gadsden house, which was used as a school house at one time, was the soup kitchen’s first home. When the operation became self-sufficient, it was moved to its current location, at 306 W. Franklin St. Today it is supported by donations from individuals, churches, companies and the United Way of Anderson County. They also receive support from the Abney Foundation and from the Foothills Community Foundation. It is also supported by the 30 volunteers and one paid staff member — the cook — who keep the place running five days a week. In 2014, those volunteers worked 18,627 hours to serve Anderson’s poor. “Our volunteers are dedicated,” said the kitchen’s cook, Bobby Hardman. “They come in like this is their job. They are wonderful.” Several churches and community organizations serve meals at the kitchen on Saturdays. The people of the Gospel Tabernacle of Faith on South Main Street serve up a meal at the kitchen on Sundays. Brown said it takes about $35,000 to $45,000 a year to run the kitchen, and they served 19,835 people in 2014. Every day, they typically serve about 50 to 60 people. Brown added that the level of financial support that the mission has received over the years hasn’t changed since McDowell’s death. “It’s the mission that people support, not just the missionary,” Brown said. Donations have slowed a bit because of the summer season this year, as it typical Brown and Hardman said. Hardman said donations are always greater around the holiday season but slow in the summer when families go on vacations. So McDowell is missed here. But this place is still a haven for those who are hurting and hungry. Hardman comes in as he has for 10 years to cook the meals. A small band of volunteers arrived around 9:30 a.m. Thursday so that they were ready to serve the people, who were waiting by the kitchen’s front door by 10 a.m. Lonnie Smith wiped down the tables in the dining room. Another longtime volunteer, Claude Webb, led the diners and volunteers in a prayer before the meal began. And for the following hour, the place bustled with activity, as men, women and children came in and gratefully accepted a plate of potatoes, baked beans and a hamburger steak. The only thing missing was McDowell’s distinctive laugh. Follow Charmaine Smith-Miles on Twitter @Charmaine_AIM.",

Martindale will recur as Willa Eastman, who's successfully championed underdog presidential candidates in Iowa and who \"hides her intelligence and cunning under a fake, folksy charm,\" according to CBS. Lest we forget, in the Season 6 finale, Peter (Chris Noth) told Alicia (Julianna Margulies) that he's been asked to run for president to be a viable VP candidate. So, will Willa be on Team Florrick or a rival's? \"Every year we look for a character and an actor who can go toe-to-toe with Eli Gold and make him blink,\" showrunners Robert and Michelle King said in a statement. \"So we were thrilled when Margo Martindale agreed to play Willa Eastman. Her ability to mix comedy and drama is unparalleled. And we can't wait to see how Margo and Alan deal with each other.\" Martindale previously recurred on The Americans, but left the show due to scheduling conflicts when she landed a role on The Millers. (She returned for one episode last season after The Millers was abruptly canceled.) Martindale also won an Emmy for playing Mags Bennett on Justified. As previously announced, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is coming aboard as a series regular and Cush Jumbo has also landed a recurring role. (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)

Is that hard to remember? Hint: Think counter-clockwise for controlling cooling costs. Ceiling fans create a wind chill in the room, allowing you to turn down your air conditioning and save on energy costs. You'll save even more money if you turn off the fan when you're not in the room. Ceiling fans cool people, not the room itself. If you didn’t know which way a fan should turn, you’re not alone. Research shows many people are not using fans in a way that saves on energy bills. That’s why Hunter Fan created its LOOK UP campaign that shows how to cut your air-conditioning bill by 40 percent with a ceiling fan.

Built at the University of California’s Sagehen Creek Field Station, it was designed by Seung Teak Lee and Mi Jung Lim from design firm stpmj, who wanted to create a structure with an understated shape that emphasises its surroundings. “Many architects and designers consider nature as just a background,” says Lee. “We thought it could be interesting to flip this.” (Image: Sagehen Creek Field Station) The whole barn, which measures just a metre at its widest point, is wrapped with reflective panelling to make it blend into the background, while the angled reflections of tree trunks hint at its true shape. Judging by how confusing the structure looks to human eyes, you might expect it to baffle birds as well. However, it has been specifically designed with avian sight in mind. The mirrored film reflects wavelengths visible to birds more intensely so they can see it and avoid it. Novel materials can also be used to make things invisible by bending light around objects. Two devices that cloak objects by bending light in the range visible to humans were able to conceal tiny microphones placed on a wall.",

    "DiffbotBody": "As a child, Amy Hollander would ride her bike to Grover's Mill, the storied New Jersey village where aliens landed in Orson Welles' radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds.\" But it wasn't the Martians that interested her; it was the idle mill on the pond. She would while away the afternoon on the nearby bridge, watching the mill turn on the water just outside Princeton. \"It's something that captivated my interest. Why was it here and what did it do?\" she recalled. \"I was interested in how it worked when it was originally doing what it was meant to be doing.\" That curiosity helped launch Hollander's 20-year career in history, culminating this spring with her appointment as the new head of the National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem. As the executive director, Hollander, 46, is charged with opening the long-anticipated museum at the former Bethlehem Steel plant by next year. Much is expected of Hollander, who inherits a project 18 years in the making and entangled in controversy. And she says she's up for the challenge. \"If I were to design a dream job, it would be to be the executive director of the National Museum of Industrial History, a Smithsonian affiliate in a local, engaged community that is passionate about saving the vanishing landscape, which is how this appears to me,\" Hollander said. \"This is the classic historic preservation success story.\" In the backdrop of the plant's blast furnaces, the museum is the elusive piece of SteelStacks, a growing cultural and entertainment campus kick-started by the opening of the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem. SteelStacks, which opened in 2011, includes PBS-39 studios, Bethlehem Landing visitor center, ArtsQuest Center, an outdoor stage, plazas and a new elevated walkway connecting the industrial relics to the Sands property. While those projects took shape at SteelStacks, museum officials were securing artifacts, including an operable loom that dates to the 1700s, a 13-ton refrigeration compressor from a 19th century brewery, and two large bronze statues plucked from Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab's New York City mansion. Meanwhile, community leaders amassed enough money for some renovations but not enough to complete the museum. The stagnation prompted a Northampton County grand jury review, which in 2014 concluded the museum's board and president had squandered $15.8 million in donations and overpaid its then-president and CEO Stephen Donches with a salary of $180,000 per year. The grand jury recommended state Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office look into the matter, which ended with Kane's office mandating in January that the museum open in two years, dissolve or merge with another nonprofit. Donches, a former Steel executive, retired this year. But before he did, he secured an anonymous $3 million donation, just enough to finish construction. Hollander took over the $90,000 a year job in May, overseeing the renovation of Steel's old electrical repair shop into a museum that will tell the story of the machines and entrepreneurs that built America. She embodies everything the board was searching for, said museum consultant Brent Glass, former head of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. \"We were looking for someone who had clearly a strong museum background and an understanding of what museums are all about, and also experience with managing a nonprofit organization, and finally a commitment to education — and especially education in industrial history,\" said Glass, who led the search. Hollander has the education — a master's degree in historic preservation from the University of Pennsylvania. She has the experience — former head of the iconic Red Mill Village in Clinton, N.J., and the Readington museums in Hunterdon County. She has a reputation as a smart leader with an enthusiasm for history and a commitment to education, said L. Charles Marcon, chairman of the National Museum of Industrial History. \"Museums are more than just artifacts and displays. Museums are about conveying to the public a sense of history, so the educational component is very important,\" he said. Hollander's education is rooted in a passion for history. She's wielded a mallet at an old-fashioned barn-raising. She's strapped on a bonnet to teach kids about Colonial life. And she actually lives in a mill — an early 19th-century wool factory along the Musconetcong River in Warren County, N.J. When Hollander bought the stone building in 1999, it had already been restored as a home but had seen better days. It had a metal roof, plaster covering the stonework and mismatched windows that were so ill-fitted the draft would blow out a window candle. Hollander had the plaster peeled back, the stone repointed, the windows refitted and the roof replaced with the period's cedar shingles. She transformed the building, once full of spinning machines and dyeing tubs, into a home. Paintings of local landmarks cover the walls and books are stacked in floor-to-ceiling shelves fashioned by her husband, Douglas Milne. The books include a register of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which she picked up long before she knew she would be heading a museum that features artifacts from that exposition. A romantic, Hollander has a nook of Don Quixote-themed books and figurines, a case of antiquities such as flasks from Cypress and amulets from Egypt, and a miniature village — all displayed amid antique and reproduction furniture. She also has a collection of a couple dozen musical instruments from around the world, including a kantele from Finland, bali laika from Russia and a sarangi from India. She plays none of them. She's had no time to learn. A polymath, Hollander's interests are vast and varied. At Vassar College, she took so many undergraduate courses in art, history and women's studies early on that her adviser urged her to pick one for a major or plan on staying two additional years. She earned an art history degree but changed direction in graduate school, earning a degree in historic preservation. She did an internship in Israel with the country's antiquities authority and came back to New Jersey as a Main Street business booster. Hollander has run a handmade jewelry business out of her home, learned to play volleyball competitively as an adult and spent a summer writing one-line summaries for artwork for a Washington, D.C. museum. She discovered Bethlehem about 16 years ago during Celtic Classic, where she had a first date with her future husband. They went for the piping bands. They came back to Bethlehem for Musikfest and live shows at Godfrey Daniels and the Funhouse bar while making their home in Pohatcong Township, N.J. She began working for museums in earnest in 2002 when she became administrator of the Readington museums, where she oversaw three 18th-century buildings depicting Colonial life in New Jersey farming communities. Hollander helped with several restoration efforts and spent a great deal of her time making history accessible to the public. She developed Hands-on History programs centered on themes such as health and hygiene in the Colonial era and traditional crafts such as barrel-making. She would also take on the persona of Vrouw Maritje Bouman, a 36-year-old mother of five in the Colonial era. Donning a white bonnet, embroidered apron and red linen bedjacket, Hollander would tell school groups what life was like in 1755 as she performed daily chores. \"I would show them that I was cooking on a hearth and ask them if they help their moms cook on a hearth,\" she recalled. \"They would say we don't have a hearth. We have a stove. I would ask them what is it? How did it get hot? Wood? Most didn't know, but by asking them questions, if forced them to think about their world.\" Hollander played the part so seriously that a student once stopped her on the street to tell her she looked just like Vrouw Bouman and ask if she was her descendant. \"She got the kids to appreciate history,\" said Margaret Smith, program director at Readington. Hollander kept their attention, she said, through hands-on activities and stories. Hollander left Readington in 2010 when the board made her job part-time and soon after started working at Clinton's Red Mill Village. With 40,000 artifacts and a 10-acre campus along the scenic south branch of the Raritan River, the mill is well suited for exhibits and special events. Hollander tapped that potential, hosting Civil War Days and Revolutionary Days, weekend festivals that featured re-enactors. She also got a quick lesson in crisis management there. The Halloween before she was hired, the nonprofit that runs the mill had transformed the historic spot to the Asylum of Terror, haunted by \"wretched souls\" tormented by \"dementia, paranoia, violent sociopathic behaviors, physical abnormalities and deformities.\" The theme drew criticism from the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma and prompted the National Alliance on Mental Illness to alert the public about the Clinton mill. Mill officials approved a safer \"zombie\" theme the year Hollander came on board and issued a public apology in the newspaper. The board would have left it at that had it not been for Hollander, said Pat Bower, a former mill board member. Hollander reached out to the alliance and the council, creating a history exhibit on how the state had treated the mentally ill. \"She used it as an opportunity to highlight the issue and engage public discussion,\" Bower said. Hollander said some didn't want the exhibit to include the state's mistreatment of the mentally ill and the prejudices held against people with mental illness. But Hollander was insistent that a full story be told, and that the mill was the right place to tell it. \"You can't learn to do things right if you don't recognize the things that happened in the past,\" she said. Hollander left Clinton three years ago for a job as assistant director of communications and outreach at the New Jersey regional office at American Jewish Committee, an advocacy nonprofit. There, she said, she learned about building connections with people and partnerships to advance a cause. Considering just a third of the National Museum of Industrial History's budget will be covered by museum tickets, she said building partnerships — in the form of sponsors, grants and memberships — will be key. She also learned at AJC that history is more significant to people if you can show its impact on people today. She believes she can do that at the National Museum of Industrial History by showing how the machines and innovations that built America continue to have an impact on the world. And here, she'll also have an opportunity to develop programs that inspire the next generation. \"That's where the truly, truly open minds are,\" Hollander said. \"To them, the sky's the limit, anything can happen.\" It takes, she said, just one historical figure, artifact or idea to inspire a future. Just as Grover's Mill did for her.

    "LabBody": "For most Royals fans, there’s a sigh of relief that comes when a fly ball shoots into left field: Alex Gordon, the best defensive outfielder in baseball, resides there, and there is nothing — no fly ball, no tagging runner at third, no outfield fence — that Gordon cannot conquer. When Gordon was injured Wednesday night there was, fittingly, nothing at cause but himself. An awkward step on the warning track felled him. Gordon, the team’s best and longest-tenured player, sprawled in the dirt. Kansas City Star beat writer Andy McCullough compared the environment at Kauffman Stadium to that of a tomb. Suffice it to say that for the first time in a year, Royals fans felt vulnerable. In their last 162 games, the Royals are 102-60, including playoff games. Before Gordon’s injury, they led the American League Central by 4.5 games. Then came Gordon’s awkward step, which led to a grade two-plus groin strain that will sideline him for eight weeks, according to the team. As trainers tended to Gordon under the 2014 American League Champions flag, the familiar sinking feeling of being a Royals fan came back. The next day, Tampa Bay’s Grady Sizemore mashed a liner into a left field sans Gordon. Jarrod Dyson, Gordon’s replacement, raced back to the warning track. In nearly the same spot as Gordon’s injury, Dyson made an over-the-shoulder basket catch before slamming into the wall. Then turned and doubled a runner off first base. Kauffman Stadium roared, and Kansas City went on to win 8-3 to extend its division lead to 5.5 games. The sinking feeling evaporated. It’s still good to be a Royals fan.",

    "LabBody": "Step aside, Christian Grey. There's a new boss in town -- and he might even steal your girl! According to reports, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" producers may be casting Henry Cavill (\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\") as Jack Hyde, Anastasia Steele's (Dakota Johnson) boss. While the rumor hasn't been offiicially confirmed, the ink may be still wet as Cavill reportedly just signed to be part of the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" sequel. While he's immersed in several franchises, it seems that the in-demand actor doesn't want to pass on any good opportunities that will further catapult his career. Based on the erotic novel written by E.L. James, Cavill's character will get in the way of Anastasia and Christian Grey's (Jamie Dornan) relationship. While Christian offered Anastasia a job at his company, Grey Enterprises, she turned down the offer and instead took a job at a small publishing company. Things heat up at her office as Hyde instantly feels a connection towards Anastasia and then come the sexual advances towards her. When Christian gets wind of Jack coming on too strong, he threatens him to leave Anastasia alone. Using his power and his hefty wallet, Christian buys the company and makes Anastasia take the reins. Jack promises that he will seek revenge on the couple after his dismissal. The love triangle between Anastasia, Christian and Jack will reportedly be the focus of the sequel. \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is slated to be \"more of a thriller than a romantic movie.\" The sequel to \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is expected to hit theatres on Feb. 10, 2017.",

    "LabBody": "How many pigs are too many on 2.5 acres? That’s the question the Linn County Board of Commissioners will answer at 10 a.m. on July 29, and an issue that’s pitting neighbors against each other in the Riverside Drive area southwest of Albany. Commissioners Roger Nyquist, John Lindsey and Will Tucker spent more than three hours Wednesday hearing an appeal to overturn a unanimous May Planning Commission decision. If upheld, it would allow the Ben and Amy Krahn family to increase the number of pigs they can have on 2.5 acres on Riverside Drive. The property is zoned Rural Residential, which allows limited farming operations. Numerous neighbors testified that although they support the family’s efforts to raise pigs and dairy calves as 4-H projects, they do not believe the family should turn their property into what they see as a “commercial” pig farm. Ben Krahn works for the Oregon Department of Agriculture and Amy Krahn teaches ag classes at Linn-Benton Community College. They have masters degrees in agriculture and have previous experience working in the ag program at Oregon State University. The couple purchased the property in 2010 at a foreclosure auction. They have since made numerous improvements, increasing the property’s estimated value by more than $130,000. A Realtor who testified in favor of the Krahns said the property is in excellent shape and she could not tell there was a livestock operation until she was taken to the barn area on the north side of the property. The family has raised some pigs and Holstein cattle since purchasing the property, but began to increase the total number of animals after their daughter Gracie won a breeding sow. The Krahns want to raise piglets that would be sold to local 4-H club members. The Krahns say other pork producers are charging 4-H kids high prices for their pig projects. They plan to sell their 40-pound pigs at affordable prices. They would like to have a maximum of six sows/gilts; six show pigs for 4-H; four feeder pigs, one boar and a maximum of 65 farrowed piglets that would be sold at about 40 pounds. The Krahns described the best practices used in their operation, and their daughters, Gracie, 13, and Clancey, 10, both talked about how important the pigs are to their 4-H programs and in their lives. Amy Krahn said the goal isn’t to make a lot of money with the farm, it is to “develop life skills” in their children. “We don’t do competitive sports, we go to livestock shows,” Krahn said. “We don’t go on vacations, we go to livestock shows. Agriculture is our passion.” Former Linn County Extension Service staffer Karissa Deshon testified that the Krahn’s property is extremely well cared for, and on visits there were no obnoxious odors from the covered manure containment building. The Krahns also contend that nearly all of their neighbors have or have had livestock including cows, pigs, horses and goats on their properties. Neighbors have supported the Krahns’ efforts, but say they are going too far in wanting to increase their farm operation on such a small parcel of land. Thirteen people registered to speak against the conditional use permit during Wednesday’s meeting. They are concerned about increased noise, manure odors, the trespassing of bedding materials onto other properties and water drainage issues. Lisa Richard said the opposition is not about the Krahn family’s character, how they care for their animals or whether they love their livestock. “It’s about not wanting to live next to a large number of pigs,” Richard said. “Pigs make noise. They smell. Yes, we are also concerned about the value of neighboring homes.” Her husband, Joe Richard, owns JTI ag supply business, and said his company purchased Gracie Krahn’s champion pig at the Linn County Fair two years ago. “But it’s grown from two sows to where it is today,” Richard said. “Every year it keeps growing. We support 4-H and purchase animals in four or five counties.” The Richard family is also concerned because their father owns a 2.5-acre parcel of bare land that borders the Krahn property’s north border. They plan to sell the property they believe is valued at about $165,000. “We are not trying to run the Krahns out of the area,” Lisa Richard added. Her brother-in-law, Robert Richard, said his family grew up on a farm, but it encompassed more than 2.5 acres. “Rural residential zones require restrictions that need to be maintained to keep adjacent Rural Residential properties livable and desirable,” Richard noted in written testimony submitted to the Planning Commission. He is concerned about animal density numbers and waste materials escaping from the Krahn property, especially since the livestock pens are concentrated on the north side of the property that adjoins his father’s property. “The pigs make noise because that is their nature,” he noted. “They make noise when they are being fed, moved, or are in competition with other pigs. The increase in the number of pigs will only increase the amount of pig noise at the rear of the Krahn’s shop next to the north property line.” Richard also contended that the Krahns did not obtain the required building permits when they added a livestock shed and a roof attached to an existing shop building. That led to his need to obtain a variance from the county. Neighbor Debra Howard said that her family also benefitted from 4-H programs, but she does not support increasing the number of pigs on the site. She said pig squeals are extremely loud, measured at up to 115 decibels. She said the noise of a jet engine measures about 112 decibels. Steve Kratka said the Krahns should have researched allowable uses of the property before purchasing it. “It is zoned for limited ag use, not intensive ag use,” Kratka said.

    "LabBody": "By Meghan Rabbitt When you're making all (or most) of the \"right\" money moves -- like building a nest egg, and not racking up a ton of debt -- it can be easy to ignore your net worth, assuming it will grow as long as you're being financially responsible. But it's important to keep regular tabs on your net worth -- and actively try to increase it, says Cheryl Sherrard, a certified financial planner and director of financial planning for Clearview Wealth Management in Charlotte, North Carolina. Your net worth -- the difference between your assets and your debts -- provides a good bird's-eye view of your finances. So the greater your net worth, the more likely you'll be able to weather a rough patch, like losing a job or dealing with a sudden medical emergency. Boosting your net worth also gives you more financial security, allowing for some risks -- like finding a new job or buying a house that looks like a great investment, Sherrard adds. Kathy Gibson*, 36, from Denver, is one of those people who's doing everything right on paper. The health care research program director makes a six-figure income, saves regularly for retirement and emergencies, has a decent home down payment fund and has no debt, having paid off her student loans two years ago. But in order to move on to the next phase of her life with financial confidence, Kathy believes there's more she could be doing to increase her net worth. \"I often wonder if I'll have enough money when I retire, and I don't want to fall into the trap of assuming that I'll eventually be married and have two retirement incomes to fall back on,\" she says. What's more, Kathy's career involves moving from one project to another, with contracts that tend to last two to four years -- so there's always the possibility she'll have to dip into her savings when she's between projects. We asked Kathy to share the details of her budget, savings and investments, so that Sherrard can help her find ways to boost her net worth by at least $40,000 over the next few years -- because there's always room for improvement when it comes to growing your wealth. What Kathy Says About Her Net Worth ... \"After I graduated from college in 2001, I got a job at a science lab that made me realize health care research was my passion -- and that I'd need to get my master's degree in public health to continue climbing the ranks. \"Fortunately, I didn't have any debt from my undergrad years -- my parents were awesome and covered tuition for me -- but I did have to take out about $45,000 in student loans for my graduate program. That put my net worth in the red, but I anticipated my future career would pay me well enough to be able to chip away at it relatively quickly. \"Right out of grad school, I got a job working on hospital research databases, and I continued to get promotions for the next five years. As my pay grew, I put more toward my student loan, taking care of the bulk of that debt during this time -- and also started socking away money into a 401(k) and a home down payment fund. \"Then I got my current job, which bumped my income up further -- but the trade-off was job stability. The projects I work on are steady for a few years, but there's always a chance that the groups we contract with won't renew. As such, I've tried to beef up my emergency savings, but I suspect the [financial planner] will tell me I should be saving more. \"Overall, I feel like I'm doing pretty well. I put about 4 percent of my salary into my 401(k), which my company matches. I also have about $66,000 from my old 401(k) rolled over into an IRA, and I've saved up enough for a down payment on a home. \"My fixed expenses are relatively low compared to my $4,800 per month take-home pay because I've paid my student loans and car off -- plus, it's a hybrid, which means low fuel costs. I'm also good about paying off my credit cards every month. \"I do anticipate that my $850 monthly rent will become something like a $1,200 per month mortgage if I end up buying a house, so I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to cover all my financial bases.\" \"I'd suggest Kathy consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Over the next five years, that would add almost $27,500 to her retirement savings.\" What the Financial Planner Says About Kathy's Net Worth ... Cheryl Sherrard: \"She's doing a great job planning for her future. She also deserves kudos for not depending on marriage for financial stability. She's taking charge of her own financial success, which is a great attitude to have. \"Because Kathy has no debt, her net worth is the total of her savings, a little more than $150,000. To beef it up further, I think Kathy's first net-worth-boosting goal should be to increase her emergency savings because her income isn't completely stable, and she doesn't have another person's income to rely on as a backup. \"My recommendation would be to have somewhere between six and 12 months of pay saved, which is anywhere between $28,800 and $57,600. Even doubling her current emergency fund to get closer to the $30,000 mark would be great. \"To build up to that over the next four years, Kathy will need to sock away a little more than $300 each month, which she could do by re-evaluating her discretionary spending. \"For example, could she spend $100 on an espresso machine rather than drop $4 to $5 on lattes every day? I'd also challenge Kathy to set aside a certain amount each month for eating out -- maybe half of what she spends now -- because it's easy to get into the habit of ordering takeout or going to restaurants without realizing how much you're spending. \"In fact, considering that what she spends on entertainment, food and drinks takes up more than a quarter of her take-home pay, I think Kathy can look for further cuts in these categories in order to boost her nest egg. \"As for her retirement savings, it's great that she's taking advantage of her employer 401(k) match, but it'd be better if she could find a bit more than 4 percent to invest. I'd even go a step further and suggest Kathy consider contributing to a Roth IRA, since her income still qualifies her for one. \"Currently, the maximum contribution is $5,500 a year, which breaks down to about $458 a month. She's debt-free, doesn't have a lot of other expenses, and lives within her means, so I think that's a reasonable goal. Over the next five years, that would add about $27,500 to her retirement savings. \"If Kathy built up a $64,000 down payment in order to put down 20 percent, that means she's thinking of buying a $300,000 home. I would just caution her not to buy more house than she needs. \"If she uses all of that savings, it won't leave her much wiggle room if she has to, say, fix a broken water heater. I also wonder if she has seriously considered all of the extra expenses that she'll incur as a homeowner. \"Not only will her mortgage be more than her rent, but she'll also have to think about taxes, insurance -- and a utility bill that could be 10 to 15 times more than the $20 she's paying right now. \"I'd suggest that Kathy pretend she's already purchased this new house and stash the extra expenses in a separate 'house emergency' fund. This way, she's crystal clear on how much she'll really pay to own a home -- and it can help her see where she may need to make adjustments to her flex spending in order to cover those new costs. \"My guess is that in 'practicing' being a homeowner she'd be putting $600 to $800 a month into her house emergency fund, which could be as much as another $9,600 in savings a year. \"Finally, if Kathy wants to make even faster gains on her net worth, she might consider freelancing on the side, if that's feasible given her work commitments. Some of her skills might translate into a part-time gig that could help her save even more aggressively.\" \"I'm close to putting an offer in on a house, and I was considering funneling any down payment money I don't use into my IRA, but I may put that into a house emergency savings account.\" What Kathy Says About Her Planner's Advice ... \"I think these are all things I can start implementing immediately. I know that beefing up my emergency savings is really important, so that's something I'll make a priority. \"I also like the idea of stashing away a bit more money toward retirement via a Roth IRA -- it'll be nice to add a cushion to my retirement money. \"I'm close to putting an offer in on a house, so I definitely need to start calculating my increased expenses -- and socking away that extra $600 to $800 a month Cheryl suggested. I was considering funneling any down payment money I don't use into my IRA, but I may put that into a house emergency savings account instead. \"Regarding my 'fun' expenses, I had a feeling Cheryl was going to call me out on those. I love going to concerts, and since I live alone, I go out a lot to meet my friends for meals or drinks. It's no fun cooking for myself! \"But there are definitely ways I can still socialize without having to spend as much -- and I'll try to make that happen over the next few months so I can start to build better spending habits. \"It's encouraging to know that I'm making a lot of good financial planning moves, but it's even nicer knowing what I could be doing better. I don't want to get lulled into thinking that I'm doing fine when there are ways that I could be saving more and building my net worth.\" *Name has been changed.",

    "LabBody": "India will benefit from the new bank, but should keep China’s interests in check. It is not without reason that the launching of the New Development Bank — as the Brics Bank has now been named — is being seen as a momentous development. The reason for this lies not just in the collective economic clout of Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa — their combined GDP equals that of the US, whereas the latter was double their size as recently as in 2007 — but also in the fact that the Bank’s rules are a sharp break from the IMF’s. The IMF assigns voting and borrowing rights to its 188 member-countries broadly on the basis of their shares in world GDP about two decades ago; this does not take into account the emergence of China and India, respectively, as the second and tenth largest economies. Whereas the IMF system is one where the OECD, and the US in particular, wields financial and ideological clout, the NDB has been envisaged as one where founder members enjoy equal voting rights. The initial paid-up capital of $50 billion has been created by equal contributions. A contingency reserve fund of $100 billion will be set up to meet currency crises and balance of payments contingencies, for which China will contribute $41 billion, India, Brazil and Russia $18 billion each, and South Africa $5 billion. The NDB may not insist on macroeconomic conditionalities of the sort that were imposed on Greece. The most significant feature of the Bank is its intent to promote trade between member countries in their respective currencies rather than the dollar. This could insulate about 15 per cent of world trade from the greenback. When seen along with the fact that China and Russia are entering into a 30-year gas sharing arrangement denominated in their currencies, the possibility that emerges is one of the dollar gradually losing its pre-eminence. But behind the NDB’s egalitarian facade, there can be no denying that China is the dominant partner. Its financial agenda is to earn a better return on its $3.8 trillion reserves than the 1.6 per cent US treasuries offer today. China’s dominant presence in the 57-member Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, of which the US and Japan are not a part, is also aimed at expanding its economic and financial footprint. The NDB and AIIB will compete with the 50-year-old Asian Development Bank and possibly influence the working of Pacific Rim trade bodies. India has much to gain from diversifying its trade and currency basket by being a key Brics player. For instance, it makes sense for the RBI to diversify its currency holdings, now overwhelmingly invested in US treasuries. However, it should be wary of a hegemonic China, which is clearly attempting to reshape the world economic order by its financial spearheading of alternative multilateral institutions. While the emergence of many multilateral bodies will enable India to obtain credit on better terms, it has to ensure that it is not seen as casting its lot with one camp.",

    "LabBody": "Creativity is considered by many to be a mysterious, unexplainable force. Some people believe it can be taught or at least honed as a skill to improve personal happiness. In the mind of a true artistic genius, creativity often manifests itself alongside psychological issues — as in the case of painters Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, who had a messy, violent friendship, and neither of whom functioned well in everyday society. Such thinking gives rise to the idea that all artists are crazy. But where does creativity actually come from? Can it be seen in brain imaging? Is there really a connection between artistic temperament and clinical mental illness? Nancy C. Andreasen, the Andrew H. Woods Chair of Psychiatry and director of the Neuroimaging Research Center and Mental Health Clinical Research Center at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, is the author of The Broken Brain: The Biological Revolution in Psychiatry (1984), Brave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genome (2001), and The Creating Brain: The Neuroscience of Genius (2005). Andreasen is a neuroscientist and psychiatrist with research interests in creativity, spirituality, neuroimaging, genomics, and the natural history and neural mechanisms of schizophrenia. She helped establish the foundations for the study of stress disorders by writing the definition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) III, and she received the President’s National Medal of Science in 2000.

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "TALLAHASSEE | Never a group content to abandon lost causes, the Sons of the Confederate Veterans continues to push for soldiers who fought for the South in the Civil War to be included in the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame — through legal action, if necessary. A panel formed to suggest names for the hall to Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Cabinet did not choose either of two Confederate nominees for the next class Thursday. It selected other veterans, including former Gov. Lawton Chiles, to be inducted into the hall — but all those veterans were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, which state officials say is necessary for induction. The controversy erupted in February, when Department of Veterans' Affairs Executive Director Mike Prendergast told Scott and the Cabinet that the agency was not recommending the induction of three Confederates who were approved by the advisory council. Eventually, the Cabinet decided to send five former members of the U.S. armed forces into the hall, but not the Confederates. POSSIBLE LAWSUIT. As the council weighed the new nominees on Thursday, David McCallister of the Sons of Confederate Veterans — which says the Southern soldiers are eligible — said either his organization or individual members might sue the state over the disagreement. \"We may have to go to court to have an actual judge determine what that law says,\" said McCallister, who heads the organization's committee dealing with the hall. But Confederate symbols remain potent in the South, even more so after the recent killing of nine members of a black church in Charleston, S.C. The man charged in the crime has expressed white supremacist views. The state NAACP staunchly opposes the inclusion of Confederate soldiers in the Florida hall. Dale Landry, who is leading a new campaign for the state conference of the NAACP opposed to the flying of the Confederate battle flag on public spaces, said Thursday that the principle applies to the veterans' hall. Supporters of the Confederate veterans \"claim it's their heritage and it's the whole issue about heritage,\" Landry said. \"We've got a heritage of black folks that were the slaves for those people. And today, we refuse to sit back now and say let them put their stuff up on public property while we pay taxes. That's a slap in our faces.\" McCallister, who on Thursday wore a battle flag-themed tie and four pins that included either the battle flag or another Confederate banner, tried to distinguish between the two issues. \"Here today, we're about the Veterans' Hall of Fame,\" he said. \"We are not about the flag, we are not about any kind of public display of the flag, or anything else except the Veterans' Hall of Fame. And I think to bring other issues into this chamber is disingenuous and overreaching by Mr. Landry.\" McCallister said the group would also support the inclusion of other soldiers who would be barred from the state's interpretation of the law, including those who fought before the state was formed and those who served before the Spanish-American War. For example, McCallister said the Seminole warrior Osceola could be considered. \"He was a Floridian, and he was a military veteran. I assume he would have received the equivalent of an honorable discharge,\" McCallister said. The Florida Legislature could allow other veterans to be included in the hall by approving legislation, but Rep. Jimmie Smith, an Inverness Republican who also serves on the council, said he thought that was unlikely. \"What I do see, though, is more of a push to get the two entities that are dealing with that to come to their own solution,\" Smith said.",

    "LabBody": "The way things are going, the House Select Committee on Benghazi will never release the testimony of Sidney Blumenthal, who, let us make no bones about it, is solemnly accused of being a friend of Hillary Clinton's. Of that he is no doubt guilty, caught red-handed by his leaked emails to her, her responses to him, a vast public record, his utterances in public and private, his employment by the Clinton Foundation, his work in the Clinton White House and other such matters. But in one of the incriminating emails, Blumenthal urged Clinton to \"help Clio now\" and become more public about her role in the overthrow of Moammar Gaddafi, late of Libya (and of this world), understandably triggering the quivering suspicions of Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan. Who or what is this Clio? he inquired. The Greek goddess of history, Blumenthal responded under oath. For this and other reasons, it is not likely the transcript will be made public. The other reasons are just as cogent. The committee, the eighth to look into the Benghazi matter and determine if Clinton, as secretary of state, was somehow complicit in the deaths of four colleagues — you know, those Clintons are capable of anything — asked Blumenthal 160 questions regarding his relationship with Clinton and fewer than 20 regarding Benghazi. (The Democratic minority kept count.) The committee also asked Blumenthal more than 50 questions about his relationship with the Clinton Foundation and only four about security at Benghazi. Blumenthal was additionally asked more than 270 questions about his business dealings in Libya, which, considering that he has none, is commendable thoroughness run amok. The committee in its wisdom came to appreciate that regarding Libya, Blumenthal not only had no business interests there, but had never even been in the country. The emails concerning Libya that he had passed on to Clinton had come originally from Tyler Drumheller, the CIA's one-time top spy and someone who just might have had something interesting to say. It seemed reasonable to Blumenthal to relay them to Clinton and it seemed reasonable for her to relay them to her staff for vetting. In fact, it seems downright admirable, because the last thing you want is a government official who operates in a bubble. Given what the committee learned, its Republican majority then nimbly pivoted from insinuating a Blumenthal conflict of interest over Libya to accusing him of having nothing of interest to say about it. They got him there. Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., put it all down on paper. In a letter to the ranking member, Elijah Cummings, D-Md., he accused Blumenthal of unpardonable ignorance about things Libyan and then, sensing he was on to something, accused Clinton of wasting her time listening to him. \"So the real question is not why did the committee talk to witness Blumenthal about Benghazi and Libya; rather, why did Secretary Clinton do so?\" No, Mr. Chairman. The real question is why did you subpoena Blumenthal in the first place? Why did you subject him to over nine hours of questioning? Why has your committee selectively leaked information to make him look bad and why oh why did you say that Clinton was lying when she said that Blumenthal's emails were unsolicited? Blumenthal's lawyer, James M. Cole, a former deputy attorney general, called these and other of your statements \"inaccurate representations.\" That does not sound good. The 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy outpost in Benghazi was a tragedy compounded by some mistakes. Four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, died and their murder has had a deleterious effect on American diplomacy. U.S. diplomats are kept on a short leash. Congress has looked into this over and over again, and despite the heroic efforts of many Republicans, Hillary Clinton has proved to be not at fault — although Susan Rice, then the U.N. ambassador, waltzed through the Sunday talk shows after the attack tossing the verbal equivalent of chaff. But the truth, as occasionally happens, won out. The matter should be settled. God only knows how much these many investigations have cost. But the expense to the government, as opposed to Blumenthal's, is a trivial matter. What matters much more is Congress' abuse of power — a transparent attempt to placate the twisted conspiracy theories of right-wing Clinton haters. \"Witness Blumenthal,\" an appellation with an eerie Stalinist ring to it, has now been accused of knowing Libya too little and Clinton too much. No wonder Republicans want to keep Guantanamo open. (Richard Cohen writes for the Washington Post. His syndicated column appears Fridays.)",

    "LabBody": "Was Ben Affleck a rolling stone, and wherever he laid his hat was his home? According to a new report by well a known tabloid, the answer is an unequivocal \"yes.\" In the wake of Ben and Jennifer 's divorce, many fans, strangers, haters, and critics have all wondered why \"Bennifer\" ended their 10-year marriage. Allegedly, super secret sources to the National Enquirer believe they know why: Ben Affleck cheated on Jenn and had a bevy of babes. Unnamed sources say Ben was a chronic flirt and had affairs with a bevy of \"other women\" such as Blake Lively, Emily Ratajkowski, and Anna Kendrick, to name a few. Insider's claim Ben’s pattern of cheating includes women he's either worked with in past films or upcoming projects. Allegedly, Affleck, 42, and British actress, Haley Atwell, had a \"too close for comfort\" moment back in 2008. The pair had dinner with Ben's brother, Casey, when things nearly got out of hand -- for a married man. Before exchanging vows with Jennifer Garner, Benn Affleck, and Jennifer Lopez had a thing. However, their engagement (yes, they were to be married) ended suddenly. Reportedly, Jenny From The Block learned of Ben's affair with a stripper, ahem, erotic dancer, Tammy Morris. The tabloid also broke that story in 2003. Morris didn't mince her words on her tryst with Affleck. \"Once a cheater, always a cheater!\" Tammy exclaimed to NE. There's also evidence from insiders who claim Ben had a thing for Gwyneth Paltrow, his Shakespeare in Love co-star. And supposedly, Affleck \"lusted” over Forces of Nature co-star Sandra Bullock. To be fair, who wouldn't, right? After all, People named her the most beautiful woman in the world for 2015. Purportedly, Ben's list of other women includes Salma Hayek, Shoshanna Lonstei (close, but no cigar) and Survivor standout, Colleen Haskell (flirted). Then, there's Britney Spears, who admitted crushing on Ben Affleck in the past. It's unclear if they made sweet music together. Oh, baby, baby! And if that's not enough gossip about Ben's list of named home-wreckers, allegedly he veers off course at times and frolics with fans and even the hired help. Yep, rumor has it that Ben has a thing for skinny-dipping (allegedly). Interestingly, in his commentary for the 2014 crime thriller Gone Girl, in which Affleck starred, director David Fincher talked about an observation that made him uneasy about the actor. Then, he had no idea of the couple's impending divorce. Fincher said he noticed how Ben Affleck was able to get intuitively into character in his role of a suspect accused of the disappearance and possible homicide of his wife. \"This is something that Ben is extraordinarily good at when he has to cook up a phone conversation when he has to hear somebody on the other end of the phone. \"If I was his wife, I think I would be very suspicious, always, of whoever just called, because he has a real gift at being able to insinuate a conversation.\" It's your turn. Do you think cheating with a long list of other women caused Ben Affleck’s divorce with Jennifer Garner?",

    "LabBody": "Carrying a base price tag of Rs 80 lakh, India skipper fails to spark bidding war before going to Ranbir Kapoor-owned franchise for Rs 1.2 crore Think auction, talk big bucks. That's what they say. However, Mumbai City FC don't quite adhere to that philosophy. So how exactly did they manage to pull off a coup in the form of Sunil Chhetri at the Indian Super League (ISL) player auction and draft on Friday? Well, they placed their bid and hoped no other team got too serious. In the end, they 'won'. Carrying a base price tag of Rs 80 lakh, Chhetri was expected to be sold for Rs 2 crore or even more. But the India skipper's presence didn't lead to a bidding war. Eventually, he was sold to the Ranbir Kapoor-owned franchise for Rs 1.20 crore. \"It's a steal. I never imagined that the other clubs would not bid higher than the price he was sold for,\" Indranil Das Blah, CEO, Mumbai City FC, told dna. He added that the country's all-time record goal-scorer wasn't even part of their plans. Their plan was to limit spending at the auction and concentrate on the draft. \"We just bid for Chhetri thinking that the others will counter-bid till his price nears Rs 2 crore. We knew that we didn't want to spend more than 1.5 crore on a player because it would eat into our spending on an international player.\" But they managed to do the impossible. \"We still can't believe it,\" Das said. \"When we bid at Rs 1.10 crore, we realised that other teams weren't too keen on signing him. That's when we knew we had our man. But to sign the country's most high-profile player will give our team a huge boost.\" And the team certainly requires such a boost after a poor show last season. They finished seventh (second from bottom), scoring just 12 goals and conceding the most (21). So, by signing the striker duo of Nicolas Anelka and Chhetri, Mumbai have probably the best team on paper this season. Chhetri had no qualms about not starting a bidding war. \"Once you've played football for so long, you don't really care about the money. I'm happy that Mumbai have chosen me. I've never played for a team in this city, so it'll be really great. Moreover, I'm excited to partner Anelka. I think we have a well-balanced team as far as the domestic players are concerned.\" Signing Chhetri is also a great deal from a marketing perspective. \"Getting him (Chhetri) means that fans will flock the stadium to watch the home games. It will lead create more interest. And, ultimately, football will reach new levels in Mumbai. A simple move of signing Chhetri will have a huge impact,\" Blah added. While Chhetri was supposed to be the star of the auction, two other players stole the limelight from him — Bengaluru FC's Eugeneson Lyngdoh and Rino Anto. Lyngdoh became a millionaire when was purchased by FC Pune City for a whopping Rs 1.05 crore (base price of Rs 27 lakh) and Anto (Rs 17 lakh) was sold to defending champions Atletico de Kolkata for Rs 90 lakh. Atletico de Kolkata were the first to bid for Lyndoh to touch the Rs 1-crore mark, but FC Pune City eventually picked up the 28-year-old, who was named I-League's best player this season. A total of Rs 7.22 crore was spent on 10 players at the auction, with FC Goa and Kerala Blasters being the only teams not to buy any player.",

    "DiffbotBody": "About 15 to 20 residents crowded New Market’s town hall Thursday night to comment and question representatives about the planned development for the 262-acre property, which was annexed into the town in 2014. Some asked what impact this new neighborhood would have on the existing residences adjacent to the property, noting the planned bypass would create more traffic and potentially dangerous roads for those in the community. Representatives noted the bypass, which would extend Mussetter Road, is intended to alleviate congestion along Main Street and provide an alternative route for the town. Others remarked the development would cause overcrowded schools and more traffic in the area, including Steve McKay, a Monrovia resident concerned about growth in Frederick County. “It’s not good impact; it’s bad impact,” McKay said. “It’s leading to overcrowded schools and dangerous roads. And you’re contributing to that.” Betsy Smith, a nearby resident, voiced concern about adequate protection of the watershed and urged town officials to slow this development in hopes of slowing development across the county. “I think you are in the driver’s seat now, and once you allow them to go forward, you go in the back seat,” she said. Ian Bartman, a representative of those looking to develop the property, said the application submitted to the town met all requirements in order to move forward with development. “We are here for a limited purpose tonight, which is the [planned development district] floating zone. … I do not believe that you could not take a vote tonight based on the sufficiency of the evidence [submitted into] the record,” Bartman said. The town’s mayor and council delayed rezoning the property, stalling development plans and delaying the town’s approval process for the 925-home subdivision. Mayor Winslow Burhans III said he could not say when town officials would vote on the rezoning, noting they would need time to review all the information. Dubbed Calumet, the housing subdivision would include detached houses as well as town houses. A schematic plan submitted by developer Miller and Smith outlines land use in the space, including nearly 7 acres of wetlands, 65 acres of parks and wooded areas and about 3.5 houses per acre. Calumet is expected to be built in phases, but no date has been set for the start of construction, The Frederick News-Post previously reported. A memorandum between the town and developer outlines the order in which planning documents must be filed and sets some deadlines, but no exact dates are included. Miller and Smith plans to hold a town hall meeting for residents to show architectural and more detailed neighborhood design plans before those documents are submitted to the town for approval.",

    "LabBody": "If Santana Butler’s baseball skill set is lacking anything, it’s definitely not a flair for the dramatic. Butler drilled his third home run of the American Legion baseball season on Friday, his second game-winner. Mandan dug itself out of a 10-5 hole to defeat Grand Forks in an 11-10 thriller at Memorial Ballpark in the first game of a statewide doubleheader. Butler’s three-run home run capped the winning rally and dealt the visiting Royals just their second statewide loss of the summer. Mandan took the nightcap 8-5 to improve to 8-7 statewide and 18-15 overall. Grand Forks slipped to 7-3 and 20-7. Butler, a 5-foot-9, 260-pound 2015 graduate of Mandan High School, turned on a Conner Richardson fastball to clear the screen monster in left field at the 315-foot mark. The ball bounced off the top of the screen’s frame and dropped onto south Third St. The blast came on a 2-and-1 pitch. “His first pitch was a fastball on the outer half and I fouled it off,” Butler recalled. “He threw a curveball in the dirt and missed with a fastball, so I knew he’d be coming with a 2-and-1 fastball. If it was middle-in I was going to turn on it and hit the left-center gap, hopefully.” So Butler’s home run was a bonus of sorts. “I definitely didn’t swing from the heels on that one. … My first reaction was that it would be off the chain link for an easy double that would tie the game. When it skipped off he top of the fence it was a bonus run.” Mandan’s six-run sixth canceled a six-run fifth by Grand Forks. That rally included a grand slam home run by the Royals’ No. 9 hitter, Jace Braathen. Neither starting pitcher figured in the outcome. Grand Forks starter Brandon Walters gave way to reliever Conner Richardson with a run in, the bases loaded and one out in the sixth. Richardson was charged with the loss. Mandan starter Jared Walters fell victim to the Royals’ fifth-inning rally. He gave way to left-handed reliever Jarad Zittleman with six runs in, two men on and two out. Zittleman worked an inning and one-third and picked up the victory to improve to 3-2. Lefty Parker Harm pitched the seventh to earn a save. The teams were nickel-and-diming each other before the two huge rallies. Grand Forks scored a run in the first, one in the third and two in the fourth. Mandan responded with one in the first, two in the second, one in the third and one in the fourth for a 5-4 advantage. Butler, Mandan’s first baseman, did the heavy lifting for the Chiefs offense, with a single, double, home run and four RBIs. Grand Forks shortstop Ben Carolin rapped two singles and a double to go with Braathen’s grand slam. Mandan got off to a fast start in the second game, building a 7-1 lead. The Chiefs scored three runs in the first inning as Butler rapped a two-run single and added three in the second as Butler connected for a two-run double. Grand Forks cut the deficit to 7-5 with a three-run sixth. However the Chiefs could do nothing with Bryce Andresen, who came on to pitch a perfect seventh inning with two strikeouts. Andresen earned a save in the process. Butler said a comeback from a five-run deficit does wonders for a team’s confidence. “We had five errors … and came back from five runs down with a six-run sixth. That’s a huge confidence booster for us, definitely, especially since it’s against a good Grand Forks team,” he noted. “You’ve always got to compete against a team like that.” Grand Forks moves across the Missouri River to play Bismarck in a statewide doubleheader beginning at 4:30 p.m. at Municipal Ballpark. Bismarck leads the state with a 10-1 mark. The Governors stand 17-10 overall. Mandan is idle until Tuesday when it visits Bismarck for a single nine-inning noncounter. Mandan played the second game under the direction of assistant coach Reid Flaagan. Head coach Ryne Jungling and catcher Trever Leingang were ejected from the first game in the top of the seventh inning. Plate umpire Corey Stewart dismissed both of them for disputing a hit by pitch call. Mandan 11, Grand Forks 10. Grand Forks;101;260;0;-;10;10;1. Mandan;121;106;x;-;11;11;5.

A “for lease” sign hangs in the front window and the arcade sign has been removed from the outside of the building. In a Facebook post last month, Gunther’s Games owner Wes Upchurch told loyalists he was closing the store after he failed to find someone else to run the business. Upchurch was arrested last year on suspicion of conspiring to sell K2, synthetic marijuana Upchurch and his co-defendants allegedly imported from China, according to the federal indictment. Earlier this year, Street Talk reported Upchurch had temporarily closed the downtown arcade to sell some of the business’s games and that he planned to reopen the business with a focus on retro games and craft beer. Less than two months after it reopened, Upchurch decided to close the business for good. Gunther’s has a decades-long history in Columbia. It opened as part of a chain called Pin Pan Alley at 1106 E. Broadway, which is now Pickleman’s. In the late ’80s, Skip Semmons bought the arcade and renamed it Gunther’s Games. In the early ’90s, Gunther’s managed to remain in business while other Columbia arcades were forced to shut down because of competition from home gaming consoles. Greg Wolff, Steven Faber, Bart Brand and Rodney Butler bought Gunther’s in 2000. Seven years later, decreased interest in arcade games caught up with them. They closed the business and leased the space out. Upchurch and his business partner, Matt Robb, decided to revitalize Gunther’s Games in 2013 on Broadway.",

    "LabBody": "WACO (AP) — The world’s largest Baptist university has dropped specific references to homosexual acts from its sexual conduct policy, though the new policy’s application for married gay couples isn’t clear. Previously, Baylor University policy listed homosexual acts with adultery, fornication, incest, sexual abuse, harassment and assault as sexual acts that were expressly prohibited. But the university has dropped specific actions that would be considered violations and its policy now specifies only “that physical sexual intimacy is to be expressed in the context of marital fidelity.” University spokeswoman Lori Fogleman referred questions Tusday about how the policy affects to married gay couples to the policy’s application section, which still cites a 1963 Southern Baptist doctrinal statement specifying marriage as uniting one man and one woman in a lifetime commitment. “These changes were made because we didn’t believe the language reflected Baylor’s caring community. We are pleased with the recent changes to the policy language and that it states more plainly the expectations of the university,” Fogleman said in an email Tuesday. The university Board of Regents approved the policy change in May, after school administrators presented a proposal to make the sexual conduct policy apply equally to all students, faculty and staff. In 2013, then-Baylor student Trenton Garza proposed a resolution to the student senate that called for the change. The senate adopted the resolution in November 2013, but it was vetoed by the student body president and never presented to the regents. Garza told the Waco Tribune-Herald that while the revised policy still marks no shift in the university’s stance on same-sex relationships, it is a step toward inclusiveness on campus. The university’s policy toward gay students became an issue for Baylor basketball center Brittney Griner early this decade. At Baylor, Griner had to remove Twitter messages and photos of her girlfriend. After college, she went on to play in the WNBA and became the first openly gay athlete to sign with Nike and model apparel.",

His wife, Shelda, wore bright sneakers so he can easily spot her if they’re separated in the hustle and bustle of the tournament. Of all the details going into the enormous production that is the U.S. Women’s Open, every professional golfer, volunteer and spectator needs to figure out the same question: What do I wear? Take July’s hot and humid weather, add the threat of showers, the vast golf course and the fact that this is the biggest women’s golf tournament around, and the answer isn’t easy. Fans watching practice rounds balanced comfort and staying cool with stylish pops of color. Many wore golf clothing even if they weren’t competing. Golfers mainly stuck with solid colors, but some of the players showed a lot of personality in their outfits, all the way down to their shoes. Most of the golfers wore gear common at a tournament — a hat or visor, sunglasses, a polo shirt (usually made of wicking fabric) and shorts or an athletic skirt, said Jasmine Grimm, personal stylist and CEO of Lancaster-based Ruby Inc., an agency dedicated to helping women find the perfect clothes for their body type. Haeji Kim was one of a few golfers wearing pants during practice rounds. Her plaid pants have a fun side pocket, which looked like a cargo Cookie Monster. Yuting Shi, one of the younger golfers, broke from tradition and wore a polo with a message (“Hello and Smile”), stripes and buttons at one of the practices. Michelle Wie wore sleek separates in solid colors during practice rounds. In the past, she has worn camo-pattern tape to help her muscles and alignment. For this tournament, she went with pink and blue. On the other side of the lines, about 2,300 volunteers staffed the Lancaster Country Club course. Their uniform of cobalt blue shirts and khaki skirts or shorts was a common sight. Many spectators followed suit. wearing a lot of khaki. Allison Appleton of Millersville wore khaki shorts, a bright orange T-shirt and purple sneakers. A rising golfer who’s won the Lancaster Ladies City-County Individual Championship, Appleton was more interested in serving as a standard bearer at the U.S. Women’s Open and watching the action, not focusing on her clothing. But she did put some thought into her outfit. “I love fun colors,” she said. Sisters Karen Halstead of Penn Township and Diane Lausman of Manheim Township both wore bright, lightweight shirts, khaki shorts and athletic shoes. “We didn’t try to color coordinate,” Halstead said. Lausman wore golf shoes for extra support. She’s had a grueling recovery after a bicycle accident a year ago, but she made it to the country club to watch the players practice. “I love the game of golf and it was a goal for me to be walking again for this,” she said. Spectators (and a few golfers) brought umbrellas to hide from the sun. Sue Kob of Mount Joy wore a big straw hat. “I figured this wouldn’t fly off,” she said. Tammy Yarnell of Lampeter Township brought a big umbrella to shield the sun during her second volunteer shift. “I was exhausted,” she said about her first shift. “I have the umbrella because it’s hot out here.” On the other end of the attention-to-detail spectrum, Taylor Merrill of Lancaster channeled “Caddyshack” with vintage 1970s pants, a graphic 1980s golf shirt and a floral golf hat. “I love Rodney Dangerfield,” said Merrill, of Lancaster. “I love ‘Caddyshack.’ I love when people stare.” In between were fans wearing flowing shirts, white pants and summer dresses. “This sort of outfit is perfect for a nice summer day,” Grimm said. Sarah Stoltzfus of Bird-in-Hand doesn’t like shorts, so she wore a dress and comfortable flat sandals. Her friend, Kari Denlinger of Harrisburg, focused on comfortable shoes and added a cool tank top and her signature pearl earrings. Carey Eshleman of Lancaster picked her platform sandals first and then selected a breezy outfit — a tank and a maxi skirt. Barb Grimm, of Lancaster, wanted to wear an outfit that was cool and appropriate, with shoes that were stylish yet comfortable, so she picked a dress and made sure to wear coordinating sunglasses. Another style challenge is visitors can’t bring bags larger than 6-inches-by-6-inches-by-6-inches. Shelda Matthews of West Virginia bought a special purse so she would be following the rules. Visitors can bring a larger bag (12-inches-by-12-inches-by-12-inches) as long as it’s transparent. Volunteer Marilyn Hoffman of Willow Street borrowed a clear bag from a neighbor that she filled with essentials — a cellphone, lip gloss, an umbrella and Tylenol. During the practice rounds, she picked a skort for her second day of volunteering because it’s cooler. She couldn’t help but notice the golfers’ outfits and matching shoes. “The bright pink really stands out when they’re coming up the fairway,” she said.",

    "LabBody": "A grand jury has indicted Kristopher Houchin, 26, of Rapid City, on one count of second-degree murder, but not rape, of a 6-month-old girl, Houchin’s defense attorney, Betsey Harris, told the Rapid City Journal Wednesday afternoon. Harris said her investigation of the incident revealed the autopsy showed no evidence of anal rape. The investigation also revealed the child had suffered brain trauma since birth. Doctors had previously informed law enforcement officials that L'Naya White had died of shaken baby syndrome and suffered anal bleeding around the time of her death on June 26. According to police investigation reports of the incident, Houchin had been babysitting the child alone on the morning of June 26 in his apartment in the 800 block of Willsie Avenue when he and other caregivers took the child to Rapid City Regional Hospital. She was pronounced dead around noon. Houchin was first arrested on suspicion of rape and child abuse, and a few days later, Rapid City Police said the arrest included suspicion of murder. According to Harris, she has been informed that Houchin’s next scheduled court appearance on July 15 has been cancelled. Harris said the state’s attorney’s office informed her that the indictment is set to be filed Thursday morning. Reached after office hours, Pennington County Deputy State’s Attorney Scott Roetzel would not confirm the grand jury’s decision.

    "DiffbotBody": "The story of the Baby Boomers, and their movement from adolescence to adulthood, has been documented and re-told endlessly. And few bands represent that story, and the move from the relative innocence of the mid-'60s into the hedonism and burnout of the '70s, better than the Rolling Stones. They started out as seemingly polite boys in jackets and ties and they grew and changed in front of the cameras and the microphones. Their music grew darker and more cynical, just like the times. At one of their shows, the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, held just as the '60s came to a close, a group of Hell's Angels, possibly enlisted as security, killed a man, and the event, along with the Charles Manson murders four months earlier, have long been held up as the symbolic end of the peace-and-love '60s. Seen in retrospect, the Stones were a Zelig-like band for a while there, somewhere in the mix whenever there was a cultural shift underway. That post-Altamont moment was the setting for their 1971 album Sticky Fingers, an album reissued many times that was recently released in its most extensive re-packaging yet. From 1968's Beggars Banquet and the following year's Let It Bleed on through this album and 1972's Exile on Main St., the Rolling Stones had one of the great four-album runs in pop music history. This was a time when—on record, at least—they could do no wrong, and Sticky Fingers could reasonably be called their peak. Beggars and Let It Bleed might have had higher highs, but both also had their share of tossed-off tracks; Exile's tossed-off tracks, on the other hand, were pretty much the whole point—it's the underground music's fan's favorite, but it never had the broader cultural impact of its predecessor. Sticky Fingers is where the myth met the songwriting; Keith Richards' riffs and melodies were in full flower, Mick Jagger never sang better, their new guitarist, Mick Taylor, was upping the ante musically, and the whole thing was wrapped up in a brilliant packaging concept by Andy Warhol. \"Brown Sugar\" launches the record with its quintessential blues-rock riff and lyrics that get more questionable the closer you listen (Jagger has since said it was a bit of a wind-up, \"all the nasty subjects in one go\"). But words were secondary for the band at this point—Sticky Fingers is about melody, and playing, and style. The Stones were always fascinated with American music, but after the death of Brian Jones in 1969 and their move away from psychedelia, their connection to blues, R\u0026B, and country music grew even more intense. From the loping country-folk of \"Wild Horses\" and the tongue-in-cheek honky tonk of \"Dead Flowers\" to a Mississippi Fred McDowell cover (\"You Gotta Move\") to the swelling Otis Redding-style R\u0026B of \"I Got the Blues\" to the crunchy boogie of \"Bitch\" to the Latin-flavored Santana jams of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\", Sticky Fingers is a love letter to these forms, the culmination of obsessions these musicians had had since childhood. But where they once sounded like English boys doing their version of the blues, now their songs felt as lived-in as their inspirations. By this point, the Stones were so convincing playing rootsy American music it made little sense to compare them to their British peers. Musically at least, the Rolling Stones of 1971 had more in common with the Allman Brothers than they did the Who. Along with the barrelhouse piano, pedal steel, and Stax-like horns, Sticky Fingers was also only the second album to feature the guitar work of Mick Taylor, and his clean, fluid, and highly melodic leads bear a strong resemblance to Duane Allman's playing from this period. But ultimately, this is Mick Jagger's album, the same way Exile is Keith's. Of all the iconic vocalists in '60s and '70s rock, Jagger remains the hardest to imitate, at least without sounding ridiculous. That's partly because he himself never minded sounding ridiculous, and he turned his almost cartoonish swagger into a form of performance art. Jagger's voice never sounded richer or fuller than it does here (Exile mostly buried it, to artful effect), but he's doing strange things with it, mimicking and exaggerating accents, mostly from the American South, with an almost religious fervor. When the Stones were coming up, the line on British singers is that they sounded American because they grew up listening to those records; on Sticky Fingers, Jagger pushes that kind of mimicry to places that run just short of absurd. His twang on \"Dead Flowers\" is obviously played for laughs, but \"You Gotta Move\" is harder to get a bead on, partway between homage and parody and delivered with abandon. \"I Got the Blues\" is utterly sincere, with Jagger flinging every ounce of his skinny frame into it. Wherever he stands in relation to the material, Jagger is selling it, hard, and by extension selling himself as a new kind of vocalist. \"Sister Morphine\" and \"Moonlight Mile\" are the two songs that stray furthest from American music reverence, and they are highlights, showing how well the Stones could convey weariness and a weird kind of blown-out and wasted beauty. With reissue culture in overdrive, we're seeing which classic bands kept the most in their vaults. The Stones, like Zeppelin, didn't keep much. The 2010 version of Exile on Main St. pretty much cleaned out the vault as far as music from this era, so what we have here are alternate mixes, an inferior but still interesting different take of \"Brown Sugar\" with Eric Clapton, the one true rarity that has long circulated but never been officially issued. There's also, depending on which version you get, a good deal of vintage live Stones, which is the main thing to get their fans excited. Selections from two 1971 gigs, both recorded well, capture the band in a peak year. To my ears the Stones' live prowess has never quite translated to recordings. The best live records are about more: more heaviness, more jamming, more crowd noise, more energy. And their music didn't necessarily benefit from increasing any one of those things. Their songs were about a certain amount of balance between all of the elements, which is why their recordings sound so platonically perfect. With their live records, you can focus on the grooves and the riffs and the collective playing, but it's easier to notice moments of sloppiness and mistakes. Still, as far as live Stones on record, the material here is about as good as you will get. The Stones entered the '70s still young and beautiful, but they'd have their share of problems just like everyone else; they got into disco and then in the '80s they dressed like they were on \"Miami Vice\" and then finally they fully understood what nostalgia for them was really worth and they discovered the power of corporate synergy. Given the weight of history behind it and its centrality to the story of both the Rolling Stones and rock music as a whole, it can be difficult to put on Sticky Fingers and try and hear it for what it was: the highly anticipated new album from one of the biggest bands in the world, a group that at the time hadn't released a new one in two years (in 1971, that was an eternity). They were called the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band for entirely too long, but if that designation ever applied it was here.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The trio of brothers running Sunshine Market in Lynnwood, at the corner of 212th Street SW and 44th Avenue W, are serious about their fruits and vegetables.They stand behind their products, support local farmers and try to be there for their customers nearly every day of the year, 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and until 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, said Noor Almtowaq, 29. And they'll stay open later if a customer drives in at closing time, he said.He's the eldest brother and the driving force behind the purchase of the stand, which they opened in September 2013.“Noor's the heart of the entire business,” said 26-year-old Alex.Yet Noor now works at Microsoft, finding time mainly on weekends and some nights for Sunshine Market, and it's Alex who's hooked on produce.“He has so much passion for the business,” said younger brother Josh, 22. “It's like he fell in love with produce.”Alex agreed and said he's not likely to fall out of love anytime soon either. In fact, he's searching for a site for a second, bigger store where he can expand the selection. He dreams of a string of stores offering both conventional and organic produce. He said there's a science to understanding how fruits and vegetables work — “for example, potatoes hate light, bananas love heat, asparagus loves water” — and in understanding how to sell produce.“When you put tomatoes, basil, eggplants and ginger next to each other,” he said, “it's a guarantee you're going to sell them all.”He's always been interested in how things work. Younger brother Josh said Alex was the kind of kid who was forever taking things apart and putting them back together. He studied at Edmonds Community College and earned an engineering degree from the University of Washington, because he wanted to understand the technology behind materials like concrete.“I'm an inventor and my imagination was limited because I didn't understand the materials, so it limited me,” Alex said. Understanding materials “grew my imagination,” he said.The brothers didn't start out planning to go into the produce business.“I didn't even know what cilantro was, to be honest,” Josh said.Prodded by Noor, they were just looking for a business. And they liked the Lynnwood location. Perched on a hilltop at a busy intersection with three corners anchored in Mountlake Terrace, the site overlooks a Lynnwood business district and streets leading to the Alderwood Mall and I-5. It's housed a produce stand at various times in the past, as well as a coffee stand, sometimes both at once. But there were few, if any, improvements to the building and nothing seemed to last for long. That changed when the Almtowaq brothers took over the site. It was Alex who almost singlehandedly rebuilt the building, doing everything the city would let him do by himself. He redid the electrical and plumbing, built the shelves and an awning for shade. He installed new siding and garage doors that can slide up to open an entire side of the building. “He built this whole entire building all by himself,” Josh said. “He's really smart. I used to come down and watch him.”Todd Hall, planning manager for the City of Lynnwood community development, said the brothers made “significant modifications” to the building and their business is apparently running smoothly.“Since they've come in, we haven't had any complaints or anything,” Hall said. “It seems to be going really well.”The brothers said they made a lot of mistakes and their first customers didn't expect Sunshine Market to last long.At first, they didn't have proper coolers and their produce wasn't being sprayed with water to keep it fresh. So Alex installed coolers and bought the software for a state-of-the-art sprinkler system. “My spinach now lasts two weeks,” he said. “I won't leave it in the store two weeks, but it lasts two weeks. When I first opened, I couldn't even get it to last three days.”Customer Kainitra Crammer, who lives in Bothell but works near Sunshine Market, said she loves the freshness of the produce. She can put it in her fruit bowl and it won't attract fruit flies because it's not spoiling right away, she said. “It's not the grocery store's produce,” she said, “and you can clearly tell, because of the way it lasts.”The brothers order from independent local farmers and smaller outfits like Peterson Fruit Co., a family-owned business in Mukilteo. Often it's a customer request that brings a new product into the store. That's how the brothers started carrying raw milk from Jackie's Jersey Milk in Bellingham. They started out selling 18 bottles a week and now sell 90.They also sell fresh goat milk, which is even harder to find; theirs comes from Lucky Hook Farm in Moses Lake.“People drive from like, Arlington and stuff, just to come buy it,” Josh said.They also sell organic eggs from Stiebrs Farms in Yelm, fresh every three days, he said. And duck eggs, which he described as “a very rich egg” beloved by Asians. Another big seller is their raw honey, purchased from a beekeeper with 46 beehives ranging from Mill Creek to Walla Walla, Josh said.“It is like, the best honey out there,” he said, adding, “We believe 110 percent in our honey.”There are also familiar items like chocolate milk from Twin Brooks Creamery in Lynden, coconut water, Bulgarian feta cheese and Beechers Cheese. Other jarred and canned products give a nod to the brothers' Middle Eastern roots. There's olive oil from Lebanon and Tunisia, coriander from Pakistan, Turkish figs, dolmas and cornichons, tahini paste and dates.Although they consider themselves Americans, the brothers fled with their family from Iraq in 1992, in the wake of the first Gulf War. Aided by Red Cross and United Nations workers after crossing into Saudi Arabia, the Almtowaqs made their way to Washington state, living in Everett for a time and then Lynnwood. His family history may explain in part why Alex has studied philosophy and history and seems just as prone to discussing Plato, Socrates and Galileo as he is to talking produce.Indeed, the conversation at Sunshine Market seems to be part of the customer service.“One of the coolest things here is being able to meet with the brothers,” said store regular Doug Clark, maneuvering through the market in his wheelchair. “And since I'm disabled, they actually have excellent customer service.”He's also partial to the produce, he said.“I've gone up to the Yakima fruit stand, just to compare prices and quality,” he said, “and I just turned around and came back here.”Retired media-arts teacher Claire Beach, of Edmonds, called Alex's impassioned explanations his “TED talks,” referring to the short, powerful talks made popular by the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences.She chatted with Alex on a recent visit, but that didn't distract her from the produce, which she said has helped her recover from a serious illness. She's been following an anti-inflammatory diet, including cutting down on carbs, and has lost 40 pounds and regained her vigor, she said.“This is the first time in my life I'm eating what my body wants,” said Beach, adding that she grew up in the South. “I was raised in Betty Crocker Land.”Customers like Beach are inspiring, Alex said.“When people come back and they tell you they feel better, healthier, stronger — it's a good feeling,” he said. “It keeps you going.”He could be making a lot more money as an engineer, but said he doesn't like sitting behind a desk.“Engineering is a hobby,” he said. “It's something I do because I love it.“But selling produce is different. You're selling something that feeds the entire world.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "A sign denoting property as its future site and a circulating post from a resident’s blog have the community wondering: Has McKinney ISD already made up its mind – and budget – on a new athletic stadium? The site, on the southeast corner of Hardin Boulevard and McKinney Ranch Parkway, is certainly decided. On it sits a sign that reads “Future site of McKinney ISD Stadium” above the district’s official logo. Curtis Rath, who in May ran against and lost to McKinney ISD school board incumbent Stephanie O’Dell for the Place 6 seat, this week wrote on his online blog, at rathpack.me, that the district has approved a $60 million, 12,000-seat stadium for the property. His blog shows documents from the district for the “multi purpose stadium,” featuring “cost opinion and alternative development options” and dated Oct. 17, 2014. Two different options – north side and south side sites – each provides estimates for a 12,000-seat stadium to open in 2017. The south side structure is projected to cost $57.3 million; the north side, $52.4 million, according to the documents. But, district officials said the scope and cost of the new stadium are far from finalized. The cost estimates and renderings – also shown on Rath’s blog – are “no more than conceptual drawings and numbers that were necessary when considering a future site for a stadium,” said McKinney ISD spokesman Cody Cunningham. “A stadium was not approved by the board, nor was a budget for a stadium,” he added. “The District has taken no additional steps at this time other than to secure a site adequate in size for a future stadium and parking.” Despite that explanation, Rath said the deal is all but done. In his post, which was quickly shared via email and social media, he writes, “There was no public announcement, hearings, discussion, citizens panel or any public hint, that the district, was even considering a new stadium.” Upon seeing Rath’s post, residents took to social media to respond. Some voiced displeasure with such a stadium, saying it’d be a waste of taxpayers’ money. Several mocked neighboring Allen, comparing the potential McKinney stadium to Allen’s Eagle Stadium, the nationally recognized $60 million project shut down this past year because of structural faults. After about 15 months of repair work, the facility reopened last month in time to host Allen ISD’s graduation ceremony. “Let’s just hope they don’t use the company that built Allen’s stadium,” commented Jean Seiler-Bonifacio on the McKinney Watchdog Facebook page, which shared Rath’s blog post. On the same page, Patti Waugaman Stephenson posted, “Our kids DO NOT need a ridiculous stadium like Allen’s! We need better quality teachers and a better education.” McKinney Watchdog posted Rath’s blog only to spur discussion; it has not taken a side on the new stadium to this point. Yet, some are in favor of a new stadium, even one as large as presented in the documents shared by Rath. Also in a Facebook post, Paul Elkins stated: “The students in this town deserve to have a nice stadium like everyone else. They have got a lot of years use at Ron Poe. That stadium is very old and no parking. I support building a new stadium. Our kids deserve it.” All three McKinney ISD high schools play their football games at Ron Poe Stadium just east of U.S. Highway 75 and south of White Avenue. The new stadium would sit a few miles from Allen’s Eagle Stadium. Cunningham said the decision will go to voters. The district plans to form a Citizens Long-Range Facilities Planning Committee that would develop a bond program to recommend to the school board. “Ultimately, McKinney ISD voters would decide if a bond were approved or not,” Cunningham said. While there hasn’t been any official public announcement or hearing on a new stadium, school board members have discussed the possibility. Lynn Sperry, who was re-elected to the board in May, said then that a new stadium was a topic of conversation in light of the district’s continued expansion. “While a stadium is certainly a need, there are other pressing needs as well, such as campus renovations, technology, safety and security improvements and new schools to accommodate future student growth,” Cunningham said. Stay tuned for updates on the new stadium discussion moving forward. For local news updates, follow Chris Beattie on Twitter.",

Forest River RV has agreed to a settlement with a penalty of up to $35 million after federal regulators say the company didn’t properly report safety data and recalls on some of its recreational vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Thursday, July 9, announced the agreement following a nine-month audit of Forest River’s reporting of safety data to the administration as required by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. This was part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to improve reporting compliance, said Gordon Trowbridge, communications director for the NHTSA. “We’ve been trying to proactively go through all of our data to look for holes that might indicate problems,” Trowbridge said. “This was a product of that effort.” EnviroFest returns to Wellfield Botanic Gardens in Elkhart. The exhibitions at the event are all related in some way to the environment or sustainability, with vendors showcasing recycled artwork or environmentally-friendly pest control and lawn care among other things, Elkhart Environmental Center director Ericka Popovich said.The Elkhart Wood Showcase, for one, will exhibit some of the art and furniture their woodworkers have made using logs. The Tumbleweed Jumpers will perform at the event from 5:30 to 9 p.m. with a few breaks here and there. South Bend Beer Werks will serve drinks at the event’s beer and wine garden, offering wine from Easley Winery. They’ll also be brewing an exclusive beer for the event, Popovich said. Ecstasy, cocaine and gun found by Middlebury police during traffic stop. Eric Michael Veldman of Granger, 23, and Jamie Michele Appleman of South Bend, 20, were arrested Wednesday, July 8, near the intersection of Warren and State Streets in Middlebury, according to a press release from the Middlebury Police Department. Both Veldman and Appleman are being held in Elkhart County Jail. Veldman’s bond is set at $7,500, while Appleman’s is set at $3,000.

Those are just two features that are part of the $37 million master plan announced by zoo officials during a press conference Thursday, July 9. Marcy Dean, the zoo’s executive director, said the plan to renovate and add exhibits and animals is a “revitalization” for the zoo, which opened in 1902. She could hardly contain herself while announcing the plans Thursday. Five Points Auction fire in Edwardsburg results in heavy damage, no injuries. Though no one was injured in a structure fire at Five Points Auction in Edwardsburg, Mich., firefighters said two of the business’s buildings were heavily damaged in the Thursday morning blaze. Six fire departments were called to the fire at 19659 U.S. 12 in Edwardsburg at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday, July 9. The two buildings damaged in the fire were beyond repair, according to Southeast Public Safety Authority Fire Chief Michael Holdeman. “The east building is a total loss, and the west building has enough structural damage that it is a total loss as well,” Holdeman said.",

Sunday. 1 p.m.: Salmon feed, barbeque with games, award presentations and time capsule at Marine Park. Kalama is turning 125, and this weekend’s celebration is going to taste like strawberry shortcake. To celebrate its birth, the town is throwing a three-day birthday bash packed with a car show, pageant, salmon bake, tall ships, a flea market and more. Its birthday cake will be comparable to the 5-inch deep, 5-foot wide and 16-foot long strawberry shortcake baked in 1928. To top that off, overlapping with the birthday bash is the week-long Kalama Fair. Kalama was a bustling site for the lumber industry even before it was technically settled. The 1850 Donation Land Act, which granted land to men and married couples, helped develop Kalama and the towns around it. Though many consider Ezra Meeker its first settler, the little town was formally reincorporated in 1890 after Washington became a state. Most people believe it is named after John Kalama, a Hawaiian from Maui who traveled to Washington to work for the Hudson’s Bay Co. In 1870, the first spike of the Northern Pacific Railroad’s western terminus was driven into Kalama, and the population boomed. Between 1872 and 1922, it was Cowlitz County’s seat. At the time, the town consisted of four hotels, four stores, two groceries, three saloons, one brewery, one printing office, two shoe shops, one barber shop, two churches, one machine shop, one public school and the Masonic Hall. The Imus family’s arrival in 1889 revived the town after Northern Pacific moved its headquarters to Tacoma and the population plummeted. The town later flourished from the cannery, mill and power industries. The ebb of the fishing industry and the move of lumber mills to Longview after World War I calmed the Kalama economy, which later concentrated on shoreline industries to bolster it. Kalama also flourished as a farming town and was especially important for strawberry growers, creating celebrations like the first Strawberry Festival in June 1939. Kalama claims a touch of celebrity fame when Elvis Presley supposedly slept at the Columbia Inn Motel on Sept. 4, 1962, and when the vampire romance series “Twilight” was filmed in part at Kalama High School. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft also visited in 1903 and 1911, respectively, for 15 minutes each.

    "DiffbotBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway. Separately, P\u0026G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P\u0026G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P\u0026G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P\u0026G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter \u0026 Gamble shareholders could exchange P\u0026G shares for shares of Coty. P\u0026G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P\u0026G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P\u0026G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P\u0026G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P\u0026G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P\u0026G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. “This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,” Lafley said. “We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.” Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P\u0026G’s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal “is a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,” said Ali Dibadj, a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. “The timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,” Dibadj told me. “Feels a little amateurish in terms of process by P\u0026G.” The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger, an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. “Sales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P\u0026G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,” Strebinger told me. The brands that P\u0026G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P\u0026G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P\u0026G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head \u0026 Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. “Procter \u0026 Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we’d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,” Erin Lash, a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. “However, we don’t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.” The beauty category “has remained a challenge for P\u0026G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,” Lash wrote. “We suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.” The other brands included in P\u0026G’s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice \u0026 Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce \u0026 Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. acted as financial adviser on the transaction, and Cadwalader, Wickersham \u0026 Taft LLP acted as tax counsel. Jones Day acted as legal counsel, and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P\u0026G.",
    "LabBody": "About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter \u0026 Gamble, including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company spins off or splits off CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P\u0026G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. “The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,” said A.G. Lafley, CEO of P\u0026G, in a statement released by the company. While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P\u0026G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty’s stock price. Based on Coty’s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P\u0026G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick, ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P\u0026G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P\u0026G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P\u0026G’s Duracell battery division, which P\u0026G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway.",

Lest we forget, in the Season 6 finale, Peter (Chris Noth) told Alicia (Julianna Margulies) that he's been asked to run for president to be a viable VP candidate. So, will Willa be on Team Florrick or a rival's? \"Every year we look for a character and an actor who can go toe-to-toe with Eli Gold and make him blink,\" showrunners Robert and Michelle King said in a statement. \"So we were thrilled when Margo Martindale agreed to play Willa Eastman. Her ability to mix comedy and drama is unparalleled. And we can't wait to see how Margo and Alan deal with each other.\" Martindale previously recurred on The Americans, but left the show due to scheduling conflicts when she landed a role on The Millers. (She returned for one episode last season after The Millers was abruptly canceled.) Martindale also won an Emmy for playing Mags Bennett on Justified. As previously announced, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is coming aboard as a series regular and Cush Jumbo has also landed a recurring role. (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)

    "LabBody": "DECATUR – In 1983, the year Billy Joel released his hit single, “Uptown Girl,” and cast himself as a downtown man unwilling to be overlooked, downtown Decatur was in decline. “Many corporate restaurants popped up in the 1970s and '80s, and people started to go to those,” Andrew Chiligiris said. “Now I feel people want to connect with Decatur and go where they know people care and want you to come back.” Chiligiris is betting on that as the owner of the newly refurbished Lincoln Square Lounge, one of downtown's oldest eateries, and also owner of the building that houses Anna Thai, which opened in June in the spot he renovated three years ago for another Thai restaurateur who didn't stay. The addition will bring the number of restaurants in downtown Decatur to 18, with nearly half of them open five years or less. For the renaissance, many owners credit streetscape improvements that began in 2011 and will conclude this summer with the Franklin Street corridor. In addition to creating more apartments that feed the return to downtown, Chiligiris has not only redone the main bar area and dining room of the Lincoln, he just added an adjoining banquet/overflow room in the space Capital Comics used to lease at 127 N. Main St. The gyro plate and flaming cheese are enduring menu favorites, he said. One block over, a full six dining choices occupy the east side of Merchant Street, but the oldest is Robbies Grille, focusing on salmon and other healthy options. Owner Rodney Powell said each place fills a niche, business has never been better, and that he, like most others downtown, appreciate the freedom they and their employees have to be with their families on Sundays. Those that are open on Sunday include the Lincoln, Pastabilities Italian Grille and the Downtown Cafe. Co-owner John Ninnemann said the cafe serves breakfast and lunch seven days a week but Saturday is better and Sunday's best. “There must be 10 or 12 churches within four or five blocks of here and plenty of places to park,” he said. “We serve traditional American food, and people like it.” Ninnemann and his wife Barbara are looking for a buyer who will keep the Downtown Cafe going. Open since 2006, Doherty's Pub \u0026 Pins has become such a popular place for groups to gather than John, Bob and Jeff Hawkins took out the last six bowling lanes last year to create a second banquet room. John Hawkins said customers think the roasted red pepper/smoked gouda soup is the bomb and that downtown has changed drastically since he became the owner of Robbies 20 years ago. “I think there were only three of us down here back then,” he said. “Now the park looks nice, the lighting's good, and you can walk from one place to another, order an appetizer at one, have dinner at another and eat dessert somewhere else if you want.” Paco Greenwell said opening Paco's Sol Bistro in 2010, shortly before Archer Daniels Midland Co. moved 350 employees downtown and the city began streetscape improvements, got his business off to a good start but that his chicken meatloaf and Southwestern eggrolls are what keep people coming back. He said the restaurant is doing surprisingly well after adding lunch on Saturdays in exchange for giving employees two consecutive days off by closing Monday as well as Sunday. As for what would make downtown even better, Brent Sloan of Sloan's Calzones would like to see stores stay open later in the day, Debbie Hill of St. Nicholas Grille wants some dancing, and John Redden of Taproot had been hankering for a coffee shop. Then Dilly's Bakery opened last month at 231 N. Main St., serving gourmet coffee in addition to satisfying a person's sweet tooth in almost every possible way. “There's something to be said for taking a stroll, getting a coffee and going back to work,” Redden said. “I love it that people are coming downtown instead of driving north. We are investing in ourselves again.” Worapot “Addy” Tangmunarunkit and his wife Ratana “Anna” Darawankul, owners of My Thai in Champaign and Siam Terrace in Urbana, said they are looking forward to being part of the mix of restaurants in downtown Decatur with Anna Thai. “We ... have good food and great service, served with a smile,” Tangmunarunkit said.",

    "LabBody": "SILVERDALE — The storefront that once housed a Forever 21 might shock some Kitsap Mall-goers when they walk by it now. The space is now the home of the Kitsap Art SLAM — the acronym stands for Showcasing Local Artists in the Mall — and doesn’t look much like a store any more. It’s a pop-up art gallery, open to any Kitsap artist, though there is already a waiting list to showcase art. Art is displayed on tables and walls and even the floor has become a living art project. Anyone who visits the gallery can grab some sharpies and leave their (non-profane) mark in the space. Susanna De Santos, who started the project and co-sponsored it, said more than 25 artists have had their work displayed, a number that doesn’t count the hundreds of drawings on the floor. “I don’t know whose work this is on the floor, it’s the community’s,” De Santos said. De Santos said works by are all levels of artists are displayed, from children to careers artists. “There’s people in here who have never shown their work to anybody and that’s really cool to be a part of, and hearing people’s stories,” De Santos said. The gallery has been open since June 19 but must be vacated by July 15. After that, the artists hope to relocate to a more permanent location inside the mall. De Santos said she saw the space and asked if anyone would be using it. Since most of it was going to be gutted for a new store, the mall decided to let the group use it temporarily. “It was a perfect match for these local artists to showcase their pieces in a space we had available for a short period of time,” Erin Leedham, Kitsap Mall general manager, said in an email. “The showcase has exceeded all our expectations.” Kitsap Art SLAM has benefitted from several donations — more than 20 mannequins from the Gap and chairs from Mastercuts, for instance. Each artist is painting a mannequin, and the group has coined the term “art-equin.” Artists plan to auction off the art-equins to help fund a more permanent space. Kahlan Crumbliss found the gallery when her and her family were waiting for a table at Buffalo Wild Wings. De Santos asked if any of them were artists. Crumbless’ dad told De Santos his daughter is. De Santos offered to help display her work and Crumbliss agreed, but only for a few days. Crumbliss leaves this week for her freshman year at Boise State, but she has still come into the SLAM to work on projects and paint her mannequin. “It’s just been so much fun and everyone has been so nice,” Crumbliss said. Chris Mendez, a Coast Guard mechanic and another artist on display, found the gallery in a similar way. He was in the mall with his children when he walked by and knew he had to go inside. “It just felt like a calling,” Mendez said. “I just came on in and said, ‘What’s going on?’” Jerry Mattoon, another artist with work on display, had done art in high school but only took it up full-time after he retired. Mattoon and his wife Beanie have a table set up and have been hanging out in the gallery with the other artists. Mattoon said he learned from his first gallery showing that it’s important for artists to figure out what they want to paint. “Paint what you really want to paint,” Mattoon said. “Satisfy yourself first.” De Santos said the project helps the community get easy access to art, considering the location is a prominent one in Silverdale. “It hard to get to places where you can really appreciate art, and where something is going on that’s different in our town,” De Santos said.",

The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "LabBody": "WILTON — At its regular meeting on Monday night, the Board of Selectmen discussed the process of implementing the $425,000 Main Street grant, more than a year after the Department of Housing awarded the money to the town. “The Bond Commission had not blessed the whole thing, but finally did,” said First Selectman Bill Brennan. “We got the grant in April 2015, and based on the requirements, the money is there. The goal and main focus is to improve safety and quality of life in Town Center.” Aesthetics and safety of the sidewalks and walkways in the area near Starbuck’s off River Road is the focal point. “Brick facing — we want that woven into the entire area,” Brennan said. “We want to be (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant at the intersections. We will add sidewalks at certain areas.” Part of the plan will include “integrated pavement” across the roadways, where brick-like crosswalks will serve several purposes, according to Brennan. “They give a distinct look, they are visually distinctive, and it calms drivers because they think there may be a bump,” Brennan said. “Georgetown has them.” The first selectman said after requests for proposals went out, Langan Engineering and Environmental Services out of New Haven will design the project. “Langan is in the process of briefing the Board of Selectmen, the Norwalk River Valley Trail and the Chamber of Commerce. We have the $425,000 grant. The town has a portion of in-kind contribution. The request is for the plan to be appropriate. There is not money (in the grant) for plans. We paid for them.” Most of the development will be along River Road, Godfrey Place and around Veterans Memorial Green, according to Brennan. “There’s a long narrow strip of grass that just won’t grow; it’s just weeds,” Brennan said. “That will be excavated for bricks. At the intersections, some are all brick, and each one of the corners will get ADA compliant. This will start to improve the look of the town and integrate designs. Basically, with the direction we’re going, we think we have an accurate plan. We can’t do anything outside the village, and it has to do with sidewalks. We have to pay for the plans ourselves.” Bob Nerney, director of land use management for the town, said he was surprised Wilton even got the grant in the first place. “Really what this program is for is distressed downtown communities, and to be honest I didn’t think we had a chance for it,” Nerney said. “I wouldn’t put us in the distressed category. “We needed to put a good design plan in place,” he said. “I think moving ahead and putting a good plan in place is important. This seems like a very good plan. We’re passing on the ideas to the police department for the crosswalks. It looked for the most part to be in public right of way.” Now the plan must go to the Department of Housing for final approval, then contracts must be sought and signed. It’s already approaching mid-July. “The concern we have is doing this (project) when there’s low traffic,” Brennan said. “We have to get approval from the Department of Housing, then bids and contracts, somewhat sequentially. We’d like to get the street impact before we pave River Road. We have to get (River Road) paved before next winter.” Brennan described this plan as “complementary” and not something is going to alter the landscape. “We’re not putting in ‘vest pocket’ parks,” Brennan said. “We’re not changing a lot of aspects of Town Center. We don’t have a lot of flexibility. What we’re going to do is create a better appearance. If the town looks better, it attracts more business. We had a good application. This will make the downtown more attractive and safer. When it’s all done it will look better and be safer.”",

    "LabBody": "MANILA – Filipinos tend to be loyal to brands they have used for a long time, which is good for companies that have popular brands and bad for those not too popular with the country's fast-growing consumer base. Michaelangelo Oyson, chief executive and managing director at BPI Trade, said sticking to popular brands is a common theme among emerging markets, even in Mexico and India. \"The population stick to brands as guidelines for their purchases,\" Oyson told ANC's \"On The Money.\" Oyson said some of the household names in the Philippines include Ayala, SM, Jollibee, and URC (Universal Robina Corp.). “It’s because they trust them, there is a brand equity, they have brand loyalty. They have a perception that they can relate and trust the brand,” he said. But what does this brand loyalty mean to investors? According to Oyson, a study by JP Morgan found that brand value accounts for one-third of the value of a company. \"Part of that is due to the fact that people tend to pay a higher multiple to company they can trust,\" Oyson explained. \"That's why in the case of Ayala Land, for example, they're trading in the price-to-earnings multiple of the high 20s because people trust the brand. Same thing in the case of Jollibee, which is trading close to 40 times PE in the second quarter,\" he added. Oyson noted that investors in the stck market will have to sift through about 200 names in the equity space, and some resort to brand familiarity. He said it takes a lot of years of guiding customers, and producing high quality product for companies to earn the trust of consumers and investors. He said some brands, however, take a shortcut to building brands by picking \"ambassadors\" who are well-known to the public and have a good reputation. “They want to associate the trust that the public has on these individuals with the company,” he said. For investors, Oyson said the current market pullback offers an opportunity to buy good brands at a lower price. \"You don’t want to buy high-quality brands when stocks are flying. You want to buy when foreigners are selling,” he said. Another strategy is to buy the same brands over and over again because it is hard to time the market. Oyson said because big brands don’t normally have high volatility, they are typically not for trading. To manage downside risk by choosing big brands, Oyson suggests looking at the historical performance of companies over the last 10 years. The top 10 members of the Philippine composite index were there 10 years ago and are still there today, he said.",

    "URL": "http://www.sciencealert.com/does-it-really-matter-if-you-pull-a-usb-out-without-waiting-for-it-to-safely-eject",
    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "We've all been guilty of ripping our USB drives out of our computers instead of ejecting them properly, only to receive the judgemental pop up telling us we really shouldn't have done that. But when everything on the USB works fine next time you plug it in, you can't help but wonder: does it actually do anything when you safely eject your disk before removing it? Well, we've done a little background research, and it turns out that it does. In fact, waiting those extra 30 seconds to safely eject could help to properly save your data and software. But the risk really depends on your operating system, and what you're actually doing with your USB drive. As Phillip Remaker explains over at Quora (in a response that now has more than 11,000 views), our operating systems have been programmed to treat our external drives - like USB sticks - like they'll always be there. It expects the files on it to remain accessible indefinitely and this changes the way it interacts with a flash drive. This means if a program on your computer is just reading a file and not actually saving any information to the drive, it's probably not going mess things up too much for the files on your USB stick if you suddenly yank it out. But you do risk confusing your computer, says Remaker. \"Symptoms could include: Lost data, corrupted filesystems, crashing programs, or hanging computers requiring a reboot.\" On the other hand, if you've altered or uploaded new information to your drive at some point, no matter how long ago, things are a bit more risky. That's because our operating systems are too efficient to simply stop what they're doing and save information whenever you tell it to. Instead, most are programmed to do what's known as 'write caching'. Rachel Z. Arndt explains what that means over at Popular Mechanics: \"For efficiency's sake, they don't actually write the files you're moving to the disk until there are multiple files to move. Ejecting the disk is a way of telling the computer that it's time to do the writing, regardless of whether the computer deems it efficient. When you remove a flash drive without warning the computer first, it might not have finished writing to the drive.\" This means that pulling your external drive out without warning could result in the file you just saved being lost forever - even if you saved it hours ago. So how does the \"safely remove hardware\" command fix this problem? As Remaker explains, the command does the following things: It flushes all active writes to disk. It alerts all programs (that know how to be alerted) that the disk is going away, and to take appropriate action. It alerts the user when programs have failed to take action, and still are holding files open. Of course, modern operating systems are getting better and better and preparing for us to pull the rug out from under them by trying to write and read files as quickly as possible. Windows has even introduced a feature called \"Optimise for Quick Removal\" that you can select to make sure files are written quickly, rather than by write caching, which is the most efficient way. But you can still never be sure exactly when your computer is done with your external flash drive, and that makes pulling it out a big gamble. Bottom line? \"You can remove a disk at any time, but you are at the mercy of how well programs using the disk cope with the sudden disappearance of that disk,\" says Remaker. So go on and continue living life on the edge, ripping those USB drives out with abandon if you really don't have the 30 seconds to spare. But just remember what's at stake next time you're saving precious information (say, the new Game of Thrones episode...legally downloaded, of course) onto your USB drive. H/T: Gizmodo.",

The 20-year-old woman said she met Jason Minton on Monday and agreed to go out with him for dinner that evening, Volusia County sheriff's spokesman Gary Davidson said. The woman said Minton, 39, instead took her to a bar where he bought her several drinks. After leaving the bar, Minton took her to his home in the 200 block of West Minnesota Avenue home and forced an unknown pill down the woman's throat, Davidson said.

Eventually, Minton climbed off of the woman who then ran to her own home and was taken to a hospital by a relative. Minton has not been seen since Monday night, Davidson said. He is about 5 feet 8 inches and 170 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

If someone posts a fond farewell to Peter Falk as though he's just passed, it's OK to point out that news is four-years-old. And even then, I try to keep in mind the mindset and Internet presence of the poster. For some, Falk's death (or Jane Russell's, or Anne Francis') could easily have escaped their notice. More often, the remark comes on an offbeat or fun story. A couple of years ago, a post on our Facebook page about how the price of “Two Buck Chuck” (Charles Shaw wine) going up in price found us being lit up by the Facebook news police. They observed “old news,” “irrelevant,” “not news” and “it must be a slow news day in Decatur.” Any or all of those observations might have been accurate. But more accurate was each person took the time to give their very public and very pointed opinion via social media. It was important enough as “not news” that they felt compelled to point it out. I suppose I should instead think about the hundreds or thousands who saw that headline and clicked through and smiled, or thought “Big deal” and shrugged and moved on. But I can't help thinking about the others, like the ones who go through the trouble of registering on our website just to respond to a story with a comment of one of two words. Punishable offense?

    "LabBody": "ORLANDO | Every year there is a player who looks too good for the Orlando Pro Summer League. In the weeklong league ruled by unproven rookies and unheralded journeyman, Magic forward Aaron Gordon played just three games — but he might have staked claim to that title in limited action. Gordon did a little bit of everything, averaging 21.7 points and 11.7 rebounds per game for Orlando, leading the league in both categories. But individual success doesn't trump team success — even in the summer. \"I'm very happy with the work I've shown in my game,\" Gordon said. \"We lost too many games here, and that's really what it comes down to; we lost too many. I'm just looking at the team to improve and to continue to get better and come back ready for training camp.\" While he played in just three games this week, Gordon was impressive from the start. The second-year forward pulled down a summer record-tying 18 rebounds in the Magic's first game, and continued to do a little bit of everything in the ensuing games. Point guard Elfrid Payton and this year's No. 5 overall pick, Mario Hezonja, also showed potential this week, though they each played only two games. When Gordon, Payton and Hezonja played, the team finished 1-1, but otherwise was 0-3. \"Aaron had a good week, obviously,\" said new Magic head coach Scott Skiles. \"Mario got to get his feet wet with the NBA-type competition. Guys are just trying to get used to the staff and the kinds of things we expect. It's been a good week so far.\" After putting together an impressive all-around effort in the summer league last season, Payton piled up 13 assists in two games this time around. Hezonja, whose European season just finished last month, shot just 38 percent from the field but scored 26 points in a pair of games. His dunk over Oklahoma City center Richard Solomon on Monday was one of the week's top plays. \"Really comfortable because I know almost everything — media, practice,\" said Hezonja, who finalized his contract with the team Friday. General manager Rob Hennigan announced the deal Friday. Terms were not disclosed. \"The summer league, though, all of this professional stuff, I'm used to doing it now for nine years,\" Hezonja said. OTHER ROOKIES. With the Magic's big trio only playing together the first two games, it opened the door for former second-round picks Devyn Marble and Tyler Harvey. The duo played well on Thursday. Harvey led the way with 24 points and five assists while Marble chipped in 22 points and grabbed seven rebounds for the Orlando Blue team, one of the Magic's two summer teams.

    "LabBody": "The citizens of Rochester missed out on a big celebration this year, which they have come to expect on the night before the Fourth of July. Over the years, the Rochester Fairgrounds have been the place to mark Independence Day in the Lilac City, with the annual fireworks bringing many in the community together. This year, though, residents had to look outside of the city to have a real celebration. According to city officials, Rochester fireworks have historically been put on by a volunteer organization. Previously, the fireworks have been organized by the Rochester Jaycees. When the Jaycees decided years back that they could no longer do it, the Journey Baptist Church stepped in six years ago and began organizing the event. It is clear how beneficial and the Night Before the Fourth event has been to the community. Through leadership of the church, the celebration not only benefited the eventgoers, but also Gerry's Food Pantry; those at the event were encouraged to bring donations of nonperishable items for the pantry. The patriotic annual event has also featured participation by the Ancient Order of Hibernians bagpipers, the Rochester Veterans' Council, and Spaulding High School Jr. ROTC, among other local organizations. That is, until this year. Community Service Coordinator Lisa Ball, of Journey Baptist Church, said the church would not be doing fireworks this year to focus on other projects. Whether a new organization will step up to the plate to organize the city's fireworks remains up in the air. Samantha Rodgerson, who works as the executive assistant to the city manager and City Council, recently said that the city of Rochester does not traditionally fund the fireworks display, and spending public dollars on the celebration would require City Council approval. We hope that the city will not have to seek that route to ensure a great fireworks celebration to mark Fourth of July in future years. Rather, our hope is for another volunteer organization to step up and organize the event, just as Journey Baptist Church did six years ago. And it is good to remember the amount of planning that needs to go into such a project. As Ball said in a recent interview, making the celebration happen is \"very labor-intensive,\" and requires around nine months of planning and more than 300 volunteers. This is why we hope that efforts to bring next year's celebration, through a volunteer organization, will begin as soon as possible.",

    "LabBody": "THE ISSUE. Lancaster General Health is working on a plan to significantly expand its inpatient psychiatric program. Jan L. Bergen, LG Health executive vice president and chief operating officer, said a new facility, operated with an as yet unidentified partner, would offer 70 to 100 beds. LG Hospital currently has 37 psychiatric beds. There is no denying the great need for psychiatric beds in Lancaster County and, indeed, across the country. Too many families have been through the terrible, dispiriting experience of seeking inpatient psychiatric care for a loved one, only to be told there were no beds available. Too many people experiencing mental health crises have spent hours in the emergency room, only to be discharged with a prescription for medication but no real hope of getting the care they desperately need. Our prisons and jails have turned into mental health hospitals. So acute is the need for inpatient mental health care that three University of Pennsylvania bioethicists — including Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of the Affordable Care Act — have called for the return of the mental asylum. Only 38 percent of adults with “diagnosable mental health problems” and less than 20 percent of children and adolescents get the treatment they need, according to the federal government’s mental health website. Here, LG Health regularly has to send patients in need of psychiatric care to other counties for treatment. And, as we noted in a January editorial, even when someone gets a bed in a mental health facility here, the stay often is too brief. So we’re encouraged by LG Health’s intention to expand psychiatric care here, and we look forward with great interest to learning the details of the planned expansion. We’re also heartened by the continuing work of the Lancaster County Mental Well-Being Collaborative, which was formed last year. The collaborative — which includes representatives from all the area hospitals, and other local mental health and medical service providers — has been working to identify the gaps in mental health care along the continuum of life. The collaborative members have decided to focus first on depression, a common but still misunderstood and inadequately addressed mental health concern. Primary care physicians will be encouraged to screen for depression, as they do for health issues such as high blood pressure. The challenge is to devise a standardized way of screening for depression, so providers all will be looking for the same symptoms, says Alice Yoder, who leads the collaborative and directs community health and wellness initiatives at LG Health. A greater challenge looms: where to send those identified as depressed for care. The Affordable Care Act has made mental health services an “essential benefit” that must be covered by insurers, but there are still too few providers. Then there is the challenge of overcoming the stigma that remains attached to mental illness. This is one challenge we all can work to solve. We need to cease looking at mental illness as if it were a failing or weakness, and regard it as we do any other health challenge. There should be no shame in seeking help for a mental health problem. The only shame is that such help remains difficult to find. Resources:",

An online jail log also shows warrants on a charge for stalking and violating a protective order on a total of $525,000 in bonds. Brossett was arraigned and was being held without bond Tuesday in the McLennan County Jail, McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said. Legal documents filed in the stalking case show that Brossett allegedly sent more than 200 text messages to Patschke and called her more than 10 times July 1 and July 2. The documents, filed by Det. Michael Graham, say Patschke avoided her home for several hours July 1 because she was “in fear for her safety” and thought Brossett was waiting for her. When prompted by a deputy in the case, Brossett reportedly admitted to the communications with Patschke, according to an affidavit. There had been at least one previous report made to the sheriff’s office by Patschke about an assault by Brossett, the report says. State records show that Brossett served four years of jail time after pleading guilty to an assault bodily injury of a family member charge in 2003. His record shows several other charges, including theft and possession of a controlled substance. “He has a violent past with women,” McNamara said, adding that Brossett was at one point charged with kidnapping. McNamara did not know more details in that case. Officials think Brossett and Patschke broke up recently. “From what we can tell, that’s what this whole thing was over,” McNamara said. Brossett published a post on his Facebook page June 26 that reads, “I find myself searching the deepest pit of my soul as to why a person would claim to love someone yet when you may need them the most they turn their back on you and leave you in a sea of sadness.” Brossett allegedly killed Patschke, 48, in her bedroom with the shotgun, then shot her son, before the teen and his brother, 17, escaped and hid at a neighbor’s home. That neighbor phoned police, and Patschke’s 13-year-old daughter reportedly was hiding in her bedroom when deputies arrived, McNamara said. “This was a very brutal, senseless, cowardly act,” he said. “It’s my understanding that when he broke in, there was a confrontation. The son tried to defend his mother and was shot during the effort to defend her.” Patschke was pronounced dead at the scene. Her son was shot in the forearm, and he was taken to a local hospital and is expected to be OK, McNamara said. McNamara described Patschke’s home as “a beautiful house” and said that Brossett “kicked in some doors” to gain entry. “He fired multiple times inside the residence with a shotgun and just throughout,” the sheriff said. “Every time he fired, he was shooting at people.” McNamara said officials think Brossett was trying to kill both of Patschke’s teenage sons. “She was just successful and sweet,” the sheriff said of Patschke after speaking with her family. He said she was a cheerleader while at Lorena High School and had worked for Shell since graduating from Texas A\u0026M University. “This was a very sweet, beautiful person who was gunned down in cold blood in her own home,” the sheriff said. “She was in bed asleep with her handsome sons and 13-year-old daughter in the house.” Arrested near Burleson. Brossett was arrested about 4 p.m. Monday near Burleson, about 98 miles from the scene of the crime, after a manhunt that began just after midnight Sunday, McNamara said. Brossett is listed in county records as living in Arlington and the owner and president of Texas Select Masonry. “Our main goal was to capture him before he hurt anyone else,” McNamara said. “That was on all of our minds at the time.” Patschke’s vehicle later was found off State Highway 6 about a mile from the home after Brossett used it to get back to his truck before fleeing the area, the sheriff said. The sheriff said he transported Brossett to the jail himself, with the assistance of Graham and Capt. Steve Smith. “We had a wonderful citizen in our community brutally gunned down in cold blood, and I wanted to make sure this creep was made accountable,” McNamara said of wanting to be in the vehicle with Brossett himself. “We’re so thankful that no one else or law enforcement officers were hurt trying to catch him,” McNamara said. “We had such a good effort by everybody assisting us trying to track him down. It was a very intense manhunt.” The search involved assistance from 21 units from four different agencies, including the sheriff’s office, the U.S. Marshals fugitive task force, the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office and the Texas Department of Public Safety. “We developed information that he was hiding out in a residence in Burleson and stormed the residence with 10 to 15 officers, and he gave up,” McNamara said. “There were several people in the home that didn’t have anything to do with him and that didn’t know what he had done.” McNamara said Patschke’s three children are with their father and were under security after being taken to a safe location Monday until Brossett was caught. “We were doing everything we could to make the family as safe as possible,” he said. McNamara added: “This case is heartbreaking. You see something like this happening . . . it’s just maddening and it’s heartbreaking.” Staff writer Tommy Witherspoon contributed to this story.",

The defense wrapped up Friday after two weeks of testimony that featured a pair of psychiatrists who examined Holmes and found that he was insane. Earlier in the case, two court-appointed doctors testified for the prosecution that Holmes knew the difference between right and wrong at the time of the killings and therefore was sane under Colorado law. In Colorado, prosecutors have the burden of proof in insanity cases. So the defense only needed to raise a reasonable doubt that Holmes was sane. His attorneys argued he was in the grips of a psychotic episode during the attack that killed 12 and injured 70. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",

    "LabBody": "SWAT officials conducted a drug bust Monday morning in Hewitt, arresting four people near the 200 block of Neely Road in two traffic stops and a raid on a home. Hewitt Police Chief Jim Devlin said neighbors contacted the department about suspicious activity, including traffic coming and going from the home that picked up over the holiday weekend. “It helped us mobilize, know what we’re looking for, know what we’re up against. We have people taking an active role in their community,” Devlin said. About 5 a.m. Monday, patrol officers made a traffic stop of a 2010 white Hyundai Tucson that had been parked at the home and then left quickly, said Devlin. After police noticed a pistol on the floorboard in the back of the vehicle, Devlin said officers also realized the driver was wearing body armor and had a baton in his pocket. The man Joseph Moreno, 49, was detained and found to have methamphetamine on his body, Devlin said. Moreno was charged with possession of a controlled substance and unlawfully carrying a weapon, Devlin said. Devlin said he did not know Moreno’s city of residence. Officials later learned that the pistol was a plastic replica handgun, and Moreno’s second charge stemmed from the baton, Devlin said. Devlin said Moreno gave police enough information to obtain a search warrant to raid the home with assistance from the Woodway Public Safety tactical unit, which also has five Hewitt police officers on it. Another vehicle was leaving the home when police returned for the raid about 11 a.m., Devlin said. Officers stopped that vehicle, eventually arresting the driver, Jonathan Chase Franco, 25, of Waco, on two charges of possession of a controlled substance, the chief said. Two people were arrested at the residence, and Devlin said officials found 5 grams of methamphetamine but noted “one of the guys was actively flushing it as the team made entry into the house.” Jose Richard Alverez,37, was arrested on possession of a controlled substance and tampering with evidence charges, and Melissa Renee Huffman, 34, of Waco, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, failure to identify a fugitive and a possession of a controlled substance warrant out of McLennan County, said Devlin. Devlin said he did not know Alverez’s city of residence. The McLennan County Sheriff’s Office had booked in only Moreno as of press time Monday. The other individuals were awaiting processing and mugshots were not available.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Growing up in Turkey in the 1990s, the whole live music scene was dominated by cover bands that played hits from the United States and Europe. It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. But when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was. So I went back and listened to them—and was blown away. Listen to a playlist featuring Turkish artists covered in this story: In the ‘60s and ‘70s, the music scene in Turkey flourished, producing local legends including Erkin Koray and Selda Bağcan. But a military coup in 1980 put a definite hold on the arts. There was not much happening besides pop music for a while, but a strong metal scene appeared in the ‘90s, including bands which formed the base for long running acts like Replikas, Nekropsi, and Daire 2: General Gramafon. The Internet then spurred on a new wave of vibrancy within the country's music scene, and underground musicians started to embrace their own roots and write their lyrics in Turkish. Peyote, a music venue located in the heart of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, became the first venue to exclusively book bands with original music, giving way to a healthy artistic community. Musicians in Turkey still face drawbacks on a daily basis: There are still only a handful of venues that host non-cover bands, with bigger venues only booking foreign acts (and not offering local groups support slots), and lots of music festivals have been cancelled due to new government regulations that prevent alcohol sponsorships. But these obstacles have brought bands together as they collectively work to book shows, open DIY venues, and do their own street festivals. Members of Istanbul’s music scene outside Roxy, one of the city's oldest venues for rock shows There are only a few cities in Turkey with music venues, and getting visas to play shows in Europe can be difficult, so touring is not really an option for most underground bands. But the economic inviability of making a living entirely from music—as well as the diminished chances of any type of rock stardom—has effectively eliminated certain types of musicians, leaving behind only the ones who are 100% dedicated to what they do. Right now, despite all the roadblocks in the way, there is an incredibly lively DIY music scene in Turkey, filled with talented musicians. I asked nearly 20 of these artists to take me where they feel at home in Istanbul and talked to them about the current state of the music scene. The journey led me through rehearsal spaces and tea gardens, alleyways and festive feasts.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "For anyone going to the Paula Poundstone performance Friday in The Villages, she'll be the one wearing a tie. A necktie, typically accompanied by a vest or suit, has been the comedian's signature look for most of her comedy career going back to the 1980s. Yet she owns only about 30 ties — and doesn't know how to tie any of them. \"I either leave the knot in or get someone else to tie it,\" she said in a recent telephone interview prior to her first-ever visit to this part of north-central Florida. \"A lot of famous people have tied ties for me.\" She has come out on stage to find she's the only one in the venue wearing a tie — well, at least that she can see from stage. \"But then my shows are not a formal thing …\" Her show at the Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center starts at 7 p.m. Friday. Ties are optional. Poundstone's TV comedy credits include HBO's \"Comic Relief,\" her own \"Pop-Tarts\" special — yes, she said she's \"still addicted .. though I am trying to taper off my Pop-Tart jones\" — and Craig Ferguson's late-night TV show. She is also a radio star these days, serving as a regular celebrity panelist on NPR's \"Wait Wait … Don't Tell Me.\" \"They allow me to say whatever I want,\" she noted in a biographic profile. \"I feel like I'm a batter in a batting cage. I get lobbed topics. Sometimes I just watch them go by, but every now and then I get a piece of one. If the others didn't cheat, it would be an almost perfect work experience.\" In the movies, she's now heard in Disney Pixar's smash hit \"Inside Out\" as the voice of Forgetter Paula. \"Yes, I am in a hit movie; isn't that the coolest thing?\" she said. It's no coincidence that she and her character share the name \"Paula.\" \"They named her after me,\" Poundstone said, \"and designed the character to look like me. When I'm not on stage, just hanging out, I don't wear a suit; I typically wear a baseball cap and my hair sticks out both sides.\" She has won an Emmy, a Cable Ace Award and the American Comedy Award for Best Female Comedy Club Stand-Up Comic. But these honors nearly pale compared with her character being a cake topper in \"Inside Out\" merchandise. \"Being a cake topper is just an enormous honor; after all, not just anybody can be a cake topper,\" she said. Poundstone said she discovered she could make people laugh in kindergarten. \"My teacher wrote a ‘summary note' to my parents that concluded, ‘I've enjoyed many of Paula's humorous comments about our activities,'\" she said. \"And I'd have to say she was probably the last teacher who appreciated my humorous comments in class. \"But it was nice that an adult appreciated.\" Being funny for a living remained only a vague, far-off dream. Instead, she went into the highly challenging yet hardly lucrative field of bussing tables in Massachusetts, where she was raised. \"If I wasn't a comic, I'd probably still be bussing tables for a living,\" she said, \"and I'd be an unbelievable table busser because I was pretty damn good then.\" Most bussers, however, don't wear a tie — except at the really, really fancy restaurants. An observational comedian, Poundstone likes to talk about her cats, her family, her cats, sometimes politics, her kids, news and her animals. \"I'm not actually a cat person, though I do have 15 cats and all I ever do is sift their litter and clean up after them. But we have two German shepherd part breeds, a bearded dragon\" and some other animals. \"So I'm actually an animal lover,\" she insisted, adding the cats obey better than her kids \"hands down.\" Poundstone said when she goes out on stage, she has a few routines in mind, but spends most of her time interacting with her audience. \"No two shows are alike,\" she added. An avid blogger, Poundstone often takes to social media to relieve the stress before each show. In one commentary, she talked about what she does: \"I love to do my job. I love to talk to the crowds. I relish the high that comes from laughing with a group of people. \"Just before I go on, I sometimes have a feeling that I have nothing to say. I grab a soda, and have a bit of water, and walk out on stage anyway, because I promised I would, and about two hours later I find it hard to leave.\" One might say she gets tied up in her work.

    "LabBody": "Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms don’t always stop with painful, swollen joints. Without proper treatment, the condition can cause serious, even life-threatening, problems affecting the heart, lungs and other vital organs. Read on for advice from top rheumatologists on preventing and treating the worst RA complications... Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can sometimes seem like a roster of problems: painful joints – check; another crooked finger – check; difficulty walking – check. Lung nodules – what? Crippling pain and gnarled hands are only Act One of RA, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects 2-½ times more women than men. The condition – and sometimes the drugs used to treat it – may lead to lung disease, skin problems and even cancer. “Because RA is a disease of the immune system, it’s not hard to imagine that [immune disorders], like infections, are affected [by it],” says Gary S. Firestein, M.D., a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Early, aggressive rheumatoid arthritis treatment, however, can often prevent or greatly reduce complications. “The difference between the first day I see a patient and after treatment begins is like day and night,” says Ozlem Pala, M.D., assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Rheumatology/Immunology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Read on for expert advice on 5 RA complications and their treatment from leading rheumatologists. RA complication #1: Cardiovascular disease About 40% of deaths in RA patients are the result of heart disease, according to a 2008 study at Emory University in Atlanta. RA patients face a two-fold risk for heart attacks and stroke. A stroke is the result of reduced blood supply to part of your brain, causing the death of brain cells. Patients face higher heart disease risk because RA inflammation triggers a condition called atherosclerosis, which hardens and narrows coronary arteries and makes them less flexible and unable to supply enough blood to the heart. Heart attacks and strokes are more common in patients with uncontrolled RA than in those who are on anti-inflammation treatments, Dr. Firestein notes. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Your doctor probably will prescribe oral or injected methotrexate, a medication to control inflammation and decrease pain, swelling and joint degeneration, Dr. Firestein says. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). This class of drug helps the immune system slow RA progression. Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine, biologic drugs such as etanercept and cyclosporine. If the patient has additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, high blood pressure and poor physical fitness, the patient is treated for LDL (“bad”) cholesterol – most likely with statin drugs – and encouraged to lose weight, Dr. Pala says. RA complication #2: Infectious diseases RA patients also face a higher risk for common infectious diseases, such as colds and flu, and sometimes for severe conditions, such as tuberculosis and gangrene, which is dead tissue caused by blocked circulation or a bacterial infection, says rheumatologist Scott Vogelgesang, M.D., professor of internal medicine and director of Graduate Medical Education at University of Iowa in Iowa City.Because RA is an autoimmune disease, your immune system is busy attacking healthy cells in your body, leaving fewer reserves to battle an external threat like a virus. Also, some RA treatments – including methotrexate and biologic medications (genetically engineered proteins) – lower immune system response.Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Patients with a high risk of infection should get more frequent checkups and treatment follow-ups, take infection-reducing antibiotics when needed and consider changing RA medications if they’re causing problems, says Eric Matteson, M.D., chairman of the Mayo Clinic’s Division of Rheumatology and senior author of a 2012 study about predicting an RA patient’s risk of developing an infection.It’s even possible to stop medications, Dr. Vogelgesang says.“If patients are sick with an infection, I’m likely to hold off on RA medications temporarily,” he says. “If she has an urinary tract infection, for example, has a fever and is on antibiotics, it’s best if she’s off methotrexate until the fever is gone for one week.” That gives the infection medication a chance to work and prevents other infections that may occur from the DMARD. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Rheumatologists must carefully monitor patients with lung problems, taking chestX-rays and asking about coughs, shortness of breath and other symptoms, Dr. Pala says.“If their condition changes over time from the [original] tests, we repeat the X-ray and do further [tests] for lung disease,” she adds.Inflammation-reducing RA medications, such as methotrexate, are also used – even though they sometimes, but infrequently, cause lung problems, Dr. Vogelgesang says.Deciding whether to use a medication that could cause harmful side effects is complicated, he explains.Dr. Vogelgesang relies on patient-described symptoms, blood-test and X-ray results, the progression of joint destruction and a physical exam, among other tests.After assessing the results, “we weigh the risks and benefits of treatment and come up with the best sweet spot for the patient’s condition,” he says. “We also factor in their tolerance for risk.” RA complication #4: Lymphoma and other cancers The risk for lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph glands, is 2-5 times higher in RA patients than in people without the disease, Dr. Firestein says. The reason isn’t clear, but immune-suppressing drugs could be a factor. That’s because they prevent immune cells from finding and fighting abnormal cells, Dr. Firestein says. For example, biologic drugs may hinder the body’s ability to fight tumor growth. Early studies on RA medications showed an increase in lymphomas and other cancers, but large-scale studies have found that it’s not true, he explains. “If you’re being treated with anti-RA drugs, the benefit of having RA under control outweighs the risk of side effects,” he says. On the other hand, RA patients are less likely to develop colon cancer, probably because many take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin – which reduce the risk, Dr. Firestein says. Those drugs trigger diseased stem cells to self-destruct, according to a 2010 report by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: If his patients develop cancer, “I prefer to stop the arthritis medications if we can,” because medication-induced lymphoma sometimes disappears after ending therapy, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center in Baltimore. “If a patient has to go off one medication because of side effects … we can sometimes substitute [another] RA drug,” Dr. Vogelgesang says. Sometimes chemotherapy drugs, which also inhibit the immune system, will reduce RA symptoms, he adds.But if RA is difficult to control, Dr. Vogelgesang suggests that the rheumatologist, oncologist and patient discuss the situation, so all can decide which medications and treatments are best.RA complication #5: Skin disease or vasculitisRheumatoid nodules, or small, knobby bumps on the hands, fingers, knuckles or elbows, are the most common skin complaint; about 1 in 6 RA patients will get them, says Binh Ngo, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at USC’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.They also can appear internally, in the heart, the lining of the lung and other organs.Skin-nodule complications, such as infections, ulcerations or gangrene, are more likely in patients who don’t take their RA medications as directed, Dr. Ngo says.Another serious sign of uncontrolled RA is vasculitis, which causes the walls of blood vessels in the skin to become inflamed; it shows up in less than 5% of RA patients, she says.Watch for purple splotches of varying sizes on your legs, feet, buttocks and the back of your legs, says Ali Jabbari, M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. In small blood vessels, vasculitis looks like a bruise, but in medium-size vessels it resembles raised nodules and ulcers, or gangrene, on the fingers.Vasculitis also affects other organs, including nerves to the hands and feet, finger and toe arteries and the eyes, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). It causes rapid worsening of the lungs and inflammation of coronary arteries.Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Nodules often are treated with DMARDs such as methotrexate, glucocorticoids (steroids) injected into the joints to shrink them, or, as a last resort, surgery, to remove them, Dr. Ngo says.Mild cases of vasculitis are treated with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen, according to the NHLBI. They reduce inflammation but should not be used if you’re bleeding, because they thin the blood. Ask your doctor before taking NSAIDs.A severe case of vasculitis requires prescription inflammation-reducing medications, such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.A patient with an aneurysm (abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel) due to vasculitis may require surgery to remove it, Dr. Ngo says.For more expert advice, visit Lifescript’s Rheumatoid Arthritis Health Center.

    "LabBody": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The Confederate flag was lowered from the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse to the cheers of thousands on Friday, ending its 54-year presence there and marking a stunning political reversal in a state where many thought the rebel banner would fly indefinitely. The turnabout seemed unthinkable before the June 17 massacre of nine black parishioners — including a state senator — at a Charleston church during a Bible study. Dylann Roof, a white man who was photographed with the Confederate flag, is charged in the shooting deaths, and authorities have called the killings a hate crime. The massacre reignited calls to remove Confederate flags and symbols across the South and the nation. The crowd chanted “USA” and “hey, hey, hey, goodbye” as the flag was swiftly lowered by an honor guard of South Carolina troopers during a six-minute ceremony. Gov. Nikki Haley stood on the Statehouse steps and, while she didn’t speak, nodded and smiled in the direction of the crowd after someone shouted: “Thank you, governor.” Haley supported the flag before the shooting, but the Republican had a change of heart after the killings, urging legislators to pass a bill she could sign bringing the flag down before the end of the summer. As she looked on, two troopers rolled the flag and tied it up with a string. They handed it to another trooper who brought it to the Statehouse steps. When the trooper handed it to a state archivist, the governor clapped. A van took the flag to the nearby Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum. There, it eventually will be housed in a multimillion-dollar shrine lawmakers promised to build as part of a deal to get a bill passed removing the flag. South Carolina’s leaders first flew the battle flag over the Statehouse dome in 1961 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Civil War. It remained there to represent official opposition to the civil rights movement. Decades later, mass protests against the flag by those who said it was a symbol of racism and white supremacy led to a compromise in 2000 with lawmakers who insisted that it symbolized Southern heritage and states’ rights. The two sides agreed to move the flag from the dome to a 30-foot pole next to a Confederate monument in front of the Statehouse. Many thought it would stay there. Now, even that flagpole will be torn down. No timetable was set for that. On Friday, the crowd of people who supported removing the flag vastly outnumbered those who were upset about the move. “It feels so good to be out here and be happy about it,” said Ronald Barton, 52, a pastor who also was at the ceremony in 2000. Haley did not answer questions, but earlier Friday on NBC’s “Today” show, she said: “No one should ever drive by the Statehouse and feel pain. No one should ever drive by the Statehouse and feel like they don’t belong.” The flag came down 23 days after the massacre at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Haley signed the bill with 13 pens. Nine of them went to the families of the victims. Artist Ernest Lee came to the Statehouse with a framed portrait of all nine victims. He said he hs been invited to the Charleston church on Sunday to present his artwork. He said he wished more people would turn to art for inspiration. “If they did, there wouldn’t be so much hate and violence,” he said.",

    "LabBody": "SPRINGFIELD — A budget standoff that could interrupt some state services beginning Wednesday is worth the pain if it yields fundamental business and political changes in Illinois, Gov. Bruce Rauner says. Turning the Democrats' phrase of his reform proposals against them, the Republican governor said today the initiatives he continues to insist upon are \"extreme common sense.\" The new governor made the rounds at state agencies today to speak to employees as he and Democratic leaders in the General Assembly girded for the new fiscal year amid continuing disagreement on how to fund state operations. Lawmakers were in session today he House planned to take testimony from 15 key state agencies on how they plan to weather a \"shutdown\" with no budget deal, but had retired to private party caucus meetings early in the afternoon. Democrats want to find the revenue necessary to cover what they say are vital operations, while Rauner first demands rule-changes in liability lawsuits and worker-injury compensation, along with term limits for politicians and an impartial method for drawing political district lines. The Legislature sent him a $36 billion spending plan that Democrats acknowledged was up to $4 billion out of balance, but argued Rauner could reduce spending in areas he saw fit to keep government moving ahead while talks continue. The governor vetoed the bulk of that plan last week. To Rauner, who's in the midst of his first state budget battle, the changes are essential to producing more tax revenue and keeping spending in check. To Democrats, they're \"extreme.\" \"They're extreme common sense,\" Rauner told reporters after talking to Illinois Emergency Management Agency employees. He repeated his Monday promise to see that workers get paid even without agreement on a spending plan, a scenario the Democratic attorney general later said lacked legal precedent. \"What is extreme in Illinois is our property tax burden, what is extreme is our deficit and our debt, what is extreme is our low economic growth, our low rate of job creation and our high rate of conflicts of interest inside government,\" he said. If Wednesday comes without a budget, there is enough money to pay 65,000 state employees through mid-July. But it's likely some services provided by government contractors will begin shutting down or stop because payments will cease. Rauner dismissed the idea that the anticipated confusion and commotion surrounding a shutdown could cause more harm. \"We need structural reform and see, change is hard,\" Rauner said. \"But we need to have change. If all we're going to do is keep the status quo, and if all we do is raise taxes to cover up the status quo, we'll continue in our long-term slow decline and the people of Illinois deserve better than that.\"",

    "LabBody": "Will Warne kicked a 57-yard field goal in practice, off the grass field behind Mountain View High School. He earned first-team, all-league status as a kicker the past two seasons with the Thunder. He had dreams of kicking in the biggest stadiums in college football, of walking on to a Division I program and becoming great. But then it occurred to him that he did not have to go to the Pac-12 Conference or the Southeastern Conference to become great. “If you can kick, you can kick. If you can kick, you can go anywhere,” Warne said. “My high school coach (Adam Mathieson) made me realize that.” So Warne will be attending a college most of his peers had never heard of before, a small college in Geneva, New York. Warne will compete for the kicking duties for the Hobart Statesmen. It is Division III football, but that is fine with Warne. “I can get a killer education and play football,” Warne said. “It’s still quality football.” In fact, Hobart had a player selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2015 draft. Some day, maybe, that could be Warne making it to the professional ranks. First, he has to finish his high school career. He has one more contest. Warne will be kicking for the East team at Saturday’s Freedom Bowl Classic, an all-star football game featuring Southwest Washington players. Kickoff is 7:30 p.m. at McKenzie Stadium. Warne is no stranger to the benefits of Hobart. His father and grandfather attended the school. But when Will Warne went to visit, in the middle of the winter, he was freezing. The college’s tour guide that day teased Warne for wearing too much clothing and that he better get used to the weather. Warne thought about the football seasons there, how Hobart is accustomed to making the playoffs, how those games could go into November and perhaps December. It will be cold. “I’m going to be kicking rocks,” he said. But at least he will be kicking. Warne started out as a soccer player but was introduced to the art of football kicking by Daron Alcorn, a former Arena League kicker who lives in Clark County. As a freshman, Warne went out for the Mountain View football team. He only wanted to kick, but the program had an unwritten rule that nobody just kicks, not as a freshman at least. So Warne worked out a little as a wide receiver and even got a couple looks at quarterback. As a sophomore, he was told he could, indeed, just kick. “That was the happiest day of my life,” Warne said. Don’t take that the wrong way. He loves football. It’s just he prefers his own specialty part of the game. “Football is No. 1 to me. Football teaches you things that are crucial to have in your life,” Warne said. “The ultimate goal is to enjoy myself and see how long I can ride the football train.” He expects to study architecture. Or perhaps go into the arts — he enjoyed being in front of the camera for Mountain View video productions. And he will keep kicking. That train is headed some 2,700 miles east to Hobart. Warne is attending a small college, but he still has big dreams. If you go. ? What: Freedom Bowl Classic all-star high school football game. ? When: 7:30 p.m. Saturday. ? Where: McKenzie Stadium, 2205 N.E. 138th Ave., in Vancouver. ? Cost: $10, which also includes admission to CCYF games at 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. (Net proceeds help support Shriners Hospitals for Children.)",

    "DiffbotBody": "Lisa Kohl, a 27-year-old corporate executive in Munich, has watched the ceaseless debate over the latest bailout package for Greece with concern. The COO of a German market research company, Kohl said she already pays high taxes as a single person with no children, and many Germans worry that further economic unraveling in Greece could cost Germany more money. “If we continue paying, what are we paying for?” said Kohl, echoing what she described as the sentiment of many in Germany. Kohl is one of many young Germans closely watching the debate over a solution for Greece. German millennials are part of the first generation to grow up in the single currency eurozone, and they have seen their country serve as a European Union leader for years. As unmarried young people without children, they often pay high taxes, and see themselves as bankrolling a large chunk of Greece's debt. Many are deeply invested in the situation in Greece, but are divided over whether the German government should express solidarity with their fellow Europeans in Athens or continue to take a firm stance on Greece repaying its debt. In January, 61 percent of Germans were in favor of Greece leaving the Eurozone, according to poll data. The same poll reported that 68 percent were against debt forgiveness and that 4 out of 5 people polled favored strict austerity measures. By late Thursday, the Greek government had bent considerably toward the German position, proposing a fresh bailout in exchange for accepting a broad package of spending cuts. Yet if a deal fails to materialize or if it comes without forgiveness for the enormous debts the Greek government now shoulders, many young Germans fear that they will ultimately be the ones paying the bills. Some of the fear concerning higher taxes may be unfounded, since the German government owns only a portion of Greece’s debt -- the rest of it being held by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and other governments and private banks throughout Europe. But private entities now only own 17 percent of Greece’s debt and European governments hold the lion's share: almost 62 percent of 322 billion euros. The German government has the highest stake of those Euro-area governments, making German taxpayers responsible for 65 billion euros, according to Bloomberg. “Greece Is Mocking The Rest Of Europe” Discussions surrounding debt forgiveness and the possibility of additional loans to Greece have long raged in Germany, given their large stake in Greek debt. These debates were stoked by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ visit to Strasbourg on Wednesday, where he discussed an additional 3-year loan proposal with European creditors. The new deal that Tsipras has put on the table involves a 53.5 billion euro bailout in exchange for budget and spending cuts. Young Germans have been less affected by the recession that has walloped Europe in recent years. Germany has the lowest youth unemployment rate in the European Union, while Greece’s number of unemployed young people is the second highest in the region, trailing only Spain. Still, many young Germans who are pro-austerity said they were worried Greece’s financial troubles could hurt their futures. Many talked about the need for safe spending when it comes to Greece. \"Younger people are not necessarily angry, but they feel that everything that has been done in the past two, three and four years has been for nothing -- that all the money has been wasted that could’ve been put into much better use,” said Ferdinand Vogel, 23, a student and German National Guard trainee officer who writes the current events blog “Young German.” Vogel, who lives in Berlin, said Greece needed to take more responsibility for its actions before debt forgiveness could even be put on the table. “If Greece wants to stay in the EU, it should abide by the standards of the EU,\" he said. Torsten Heinrich, 32, a writer and former youth organizer for the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, said he was fed up with the empty promises made by Tsipiras’ Syriza-led government. “Greece is mocking the rest of Europe,” said Heinrich, of Wurzburg in southern Germany. “They have promised reforms; they haven’t done anything. Instead they are asking for more money and more money ... Patience is running out.” Heinrich said he supported debt forgiveness, but only because he thought it was inevitable. “The Greeks will never be able to pay [their loans] back,” he said. Continuing Faith In The European Project Critics of Germany’s hard stance on Greece’s debt crisis, however, point to Germany’s experiences with debt forgiveness after World War II as an example of how the German government has acted hypocritically toward Greece in the past five years. In 1953, with the London Debt Agreement, Germany was forgiven around 50 percent of the debts it had incurred during reconstruction following the war. One of the major signatories of this European agreement was Greece. The agreement, in conjunction with the Marshall Plan, which provided multiple billions of dollars to post-war Germany, kept the German economy from being strangled by debt and allowed it to become the strongest economy in Europe today. People line up to buy rare goods on Berlin's market, during the Berlin occidental zone blockade by Russia, in June 1948. JEAN MANZON/AFP/Getty Images In fact, one of Tsipiras' first official acts as prime minister was to suggest that Germany pay reparations to Greece for the destruction caused when the country was occupied during the Second World War -- a move that outraged Merkel. Germany’s unforgiving tone toward Greece these days is ironic, said Timothy Guinnane, a professor of historical economics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who has written about the London Debt Agreement of 1953. “In 1953, the poor Greeks were helping the rich Germans,” he said in a phone interview. Many young Germans understand the crisis through this kind of solidarity. Julian Greth, 24, an engineering student from Munich, described the Greek population as the “victims” of the crisis -- not the Germans. He also said that everything in Europe was connected and that the EU could not simply kick Greece out without any broader repercussions. His stake in Greece is more than one of a future taxpayer. Greth is somewhat of a Grecophile and has traveled to Greece four times on vacation. “As a country, it’s still the same -- friendly, helpful,” he said of his recent experience in Greece. Matthias Adler, a 34 year-old freelance writer from Berlin, argued that Greeks deserve Germany’s financial and emotional support. Adler was born and raised in Berlin by left-wing parents and said that a good deal of his politics and those of his friends who share his views stem from their geographic location and their upbringing. The politics of south Germany, he said, tended to be more conservative and pro-austerity by comparison. From Adler’s perspective, Greece leaving the EU is unimaginable. He said he couldn't understand the fierce anger many Germans felt toward Greeks and that he would continue to stand in solidarity with them. “In my opinion, it’s not a Greek problem, it’s a European problem,” he said. “We Germans are the ones who have profited the most from this whole European Union, and I hope we don’t forget that.\"",

Posted: Friday, July 10, 2015 10:20 am Midland Reporter-Telegram | Every year, Americans eat an average of 3 1/2 pounds of fresh strawberries. The succulent and delicious fruit is a favorite summer time treat enjoyed in yogurt, ice cream, cakes or all on its own. As a member of the rose family, strawberries are not technically berries according to the botanist community. This is because they wear their seeds on the outside and scientists consider each seed its own individual fruit. Also, strawberries are a perennial plant, which means that they typically live longer than two years. In the United States, 88 percent of the strawberries harvested (2.3 billion pounds) are from California. In Texas, which is not the ideal environment for strawberry production, there are 3 main adaptive areas: South Houston, Del Rio and San Antonio. This is because strawberries require sandy soil, minimum of one inch of water per week and consistent quality sprinkler and drip irrigation. Also, they have extremely hard labor associated with their planting and harvesting. According to Texas A\u0026M Horticulture, the estimated cost per acre is $1,900 to $2,500 for establishment and annual production and the harvest is typically late March to early April. However, don’t let this be discouraging when it comes to growing your own or picking some up from your local farmers market, roadside vendor or supermarket. These heart-shaped pieces of heaven are full of nutritional value. According to WebMD, strawberries have heart-protecting antioxidants, promote increases in HDL or good cholesterol, lower blood pressure and protect against cancer. Strawberries are high in vitamin C, potassium, manganese and polyphenols. Also, these sweet treats are ranked in the top 20 antioxidant-rich fruits. This means they fight off free radicals that can cause cancer. When shopping for strawberries to prepare and eat at home there are things to consider. It is best to choose ones that have a bright, even, red color, fresh aroma and an intact, healthy, green cap. Once you get them home it is best to use them in the first few days after purchase before they become spoiled. When you want to use the strawberries it is best to clean them first. First, wash your hands with hot, soapy water for 20 seconds. Then, wash and sanitize food preparation area. Placestrawberries in a colander and wash them in a clean sink under clean, running water. Then they can be sliced up and placed back in the refrigerator or eaten. Food sanitation is highly important in preventing pathogens such as salmonella, E. coli or hepatitis A.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Who is the best player in the ? Not based on the last 10 years or one game, but over the last year: Who was the best? Good luck answering that one without starting a fight, right? Well, that's what the NFL 1000 aims to do by scouting, grading and then ranking the best players at each position before putting them in order and breaking ties to come up with the top 1,000 players. No narratives, no fantasy football points, no quarterback rating: This is cold, hard scouting. You can find rankings for all other positions on our B/R NFL 1000 main page. The B/R 1000 metric is based heavily on scouting each player and grading the key criteria for each position. The criteria are weighed according to importance for a possible best score of 100. Potential is not taken into consideration, nor are career accomplishments. Cornerbacks have many responsibilities—and those vary depending on the individual scheme. With that in mind, we graded them on run defense (10 points), coverage (75) and tackling (10), plus five points for their value as a starter or backup. In that category, we're looking at whether the player is a consistent starter, a spot starter, a top-level backup or simply a backup-only player. In the case of ties, our team asked, \"Which player would I rather have on my team?\" and set the rankings accordingly. Subjective? Yes. But ties are no fun. Each player was scouted by me and a team of experienced evaluators (Dan Bazal, Cian Fahey, Dan Hope, Marshal Miller, Justis Mosqueda) with these key criteria in mind. The following scouting reports and grades are the work of months of film study from our team. Players' heights, weights, seasons played and coverage stats from NFL.com unless otherwise noted. All other statistics from Pro Football Focus. Begin Slideshow » Coverage: 51/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 5/5 Greg Toler (6'0\", 190 lbs, 5 seasons) has big potential and has flashed top-tier talent at times, but he was far too inconsistent in 2014 as both a cover man and a tackler. On the ground, he saw 14 of his tackle attempts go for naught—a number that puts a huge damper on his run and tackle scores. In coverage, Toler played largely in man schemes while allowing nine touchdowns and letting 56 percent of attempts thrown his way go for a completion. Coverage: 53/75; Run Defense: 5/10; Tackling: 3/10; Starter: 4/5 Coming off the best season of his career in 2013, Will Blackmon (6’0”, 204 lbs, 8 seasons) crashed back down to earth with a rough 2014 campaign. Working as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ slot cornerback for their first eight games, Blackmon was picked on in coverage and did not record a single pass deflection. After missing the second half of the season with a broken finger, Blackmon was released by the Jaguars this offseason. He was picked up by the Seattle Seahawks, where he is competing to be their slot cornerback, but the injury-prone 30-year-old is truly best suited for playing on special teams. Coverage: 56/75; Run Defense: 2/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 Melvin White (6’1”, 215 lbs, 2 seasons) began the 2014 season as a starter for the Carolina Panthers but lost playing time over the course of the year due to poor performance. A big but slow cornerback, White makes some plays on the ball with his length but does not play with enough physicality or fluidity to make up for his athletic shortcomings. He is inconsistent both in coverage and as a tackler and does not make the impact a cornerback of his size should in run defense. Coverage: 52/75; Run Defense: 6/10; Tackling: 4/10; Starter: 3/5 At one point, Robert McClain (5’9”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) looked set to be one of the better slot cornerbacks in the NFL. However, his performances since that point have dropped off significantly. McClain struggles with his footwork, something that is a major issue for cornerbacks who play inside, and he can’t make up for that with length or ball skills. While he is a good run defender in terms of reacting to plays and aggressively forcing his way to ball-carriers, he must become a better tackler to truly show value there. Coverage: 55/75; Run Defense: 3/10; Tackling: 5/10; Starter: 3/5 Chris Owens (5’9”, 180 lbs, 6 seasons) is one of many players across the NFL who is immediately thought of as a good slot cornerback simply because of his size. It’s true that Owens had proved to be adequate in the past, but his skill set doesn’t allow him to handle the two-way game that comes with playing inside. Owens doesn’t have the foot speed or balance to consistently contain the faster inside receivers in the NFL, which showed during the 2014 season. Coverage: 57/75; Run Defense: 4/10; Tackling: 2/10; Starter: 3/5 While Cassius Vaughn (5’11”, 195 lbs, 5 seasons) has good long speed, he is slow coming out of his stance and flipping his hips, which enables receivers to beat him off the line frequently. He does not play physically and is a poor tackler. After one unimpressive season with the Detroit Lions, Vaughn signed this offseason with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he will have to fight just to make the 53-man roster.",

    "LabBody": "What ever did we do without the SEC Network during the Southeastern Conference football media days? Straight out of the last hurrah for the first “SEC Network Takeover” — Texas A\u0026M is featured Saturday, followed finally by Vanderbilt on Sunday — the league’s channel turns its attention to what the SEC’s followers love almost as much as the games in the fall on the gridiron themselves. Bring on coaches, players and talking heads chattering on about said upcoming contests ... and babbling on some more. Since the SEC Network debuted last August and almost immediately went into covering football games, this is perhaps the next premiere that has been most anticipated, as the fancy separate logo would indicate. As team representatives and the reporters that cover them gather for four days in Hoover, Ala., the SEC Network will have it all on lockdown. Starting at 11:30 a.m. Monday with new SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey’s opening address, the SEC Network will be there with coverage with its “SEC Now: 2015 Football Media Days Special,” which is hosted by Dari Nowkhah and Joe Tessitore and runs that initial day until 4:30 p.m. On Tuesday and Wednesday, it airs from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and on Thursday, 9 a.m. to noon. Analysts and guests joining Nowkhah and Tessitore will be Greg McElroy, Booger McFarland and Marcus Spears. It’s during these windows that the coaches’ press conferences will air, along with interviews with the coaches and players who were selected to attend. For Missouri, as Tribune beat writer David Morrison has noted on his blog and Twitter, that means Coach Gary Pinkel and quarterback Maty Mauk and center Evan Boehm — media days vets both — and cornerback Kenya Dennis, the newcomer to the Hyatt Regency Birmingham-The Wynfrey Hotel, will have their time in front of the press corps starting at 1 p.m. Wednesday. Dennis also will be the MU athlete featured in additional coverage on the SEC Network via the league’s “Beyond the Field: Stories of the SEC” initiative, which focuses on a player from each team with “a compelling story outside of his athletic endeavors.” “The Paul Finebaum Show,” both on the SEC Network on TV and ESPN Radio, will originate from Hoover, too, kicking off at its regular start time of 2 p.m. on the latter and, on the former, 4:30 p.m. Monday, 3 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday and 2 p.m. Thursday. SOUND FAMILIAR?: Fans of Missouri basketball anticipating a down-and-dirty battle for 2017 recruit Michael Porter Jr. of Tolton can look to Fayetteville, Ark., for clues on how to handle a similar fight to keep a top prospect close to home and, in the process, away from powerhouse SEC rival Kentucky. Like Porter — rated the No. 2 recruit in 2017 by ESPN, Rivals and 247Sports and No. 3 by Scout — Bentonville, Ark.’s Malik Monk is a consensus top-10 prospect in the Class of 2016. On Friday, CBSSports.com’s Gary Parrish noted that while there are many compelling recruiting stories this coming year — including ESPN’s No. 1 and 2, Harry Giles and St. Louis’ Jayson Tatum, teammates on the recent USA Under-19 world-championship squad, possibly being a package deal — none has his attention more than Monk’s. “For those who don’t know: Malik Monk is a 6-foot-4 guard from Arkansas who doubles as the younger brother of Marcus Monk — a former football and basketball player for the Razorbacks who, more recently, spent time working as what amounts to a graduate assistant in Mike Anderson’s program,” Parrish wrote. “He now helps run the Arkansas Wings summer program for which Malik Monk plays. And did I mention that their cousin is Ky Madden, who averaged 9.7 points last season for an Arkansas team that made the NCAA Tournament. “Simply put, Malik Monk’s ties to Arkansas are endless and strong.” But enter John Calipari, who is dangling the glitz and glamour of the Wildcats and the surest path to the NBA in front of Monk. “Mostly every day fans tell me to go to Arkansas,” Monk said. “But there’s no pressure at all.” “I believe the first part of the quote,” Parrish wrote. “But I’m not buying the second part at all. Because, let’s be honest, the pressure has to be extraordinary, doesn’t it? I mean, can Malik Monk really leave home and endure what would be an intense backlash? And can Marcus Monk really let his brother leave the state when he A) played at Arkansas, B) previously worked with Arkansas, C) lives in Fayetteville and D) now helps run the Arkansas Wings? “That’s what John Calipari is up against here.” Sure, but with Cal’s track record, all that easily could mean squat. And if Monk does stick with the Hogs, nobody pities Big Blue.",

AK writes: \"I read your article about storing iPhone backups on an external drive I tried that and it worked flawlessly.

Carrying an external hard drive everywhere is a real pain.\" So here's the deal: You need to delete the Backup symbolic link you created as a result of following those directions. Creaitng the symlink is a bit of a pain because it requires some command line trickery in Terminal. Fortunately, rectifying the change is much easier: It's something you can do from the comfort of OS X's graphical user interface instead. To do so: Open the Finder. Hold down the Option key and click on the Go menu. Select Library. Click on Application Support, then click on MobileSync. Delete the file labeled Backup. That's the symbolic link you created, which goes to the external drive. iTunes should now resume normal local backups of your iOS devices unless you tell it otherwise.",

Frankel didn’t hit it off with Heather Thomson or Kristen Taekman, but during the dramatic final dinner in Turks and Caicos, she managed to fly under the radar. According to a new Bravo report, Bethenny Frankel is now revealing that she actually thought the cursing dinner was hilarious. The drama was reaching an all-time high with these ladies, but since Bethenny wasn’t involved, she found it funny and entertaining. “The cursing dinner was hilarious. It should be called the hypocrite dinner. Heather can curse all she wants and literally DOES NOT curse more than anyone including Luann, Sonja and Dorinda,” Bethenny points out, adding, “These women are all full of SH--. They all curse like drunken sailors. Ramona doesn't cop to her words, her actions, or her sex life. Why would she cop to her words?” Of course, the episode continues next week with the dramatic conclusion to the dinner. But even though Kristen isn’t Bethenny Frankel’s closest friend, she did add some comic relief to the final dinner. And apparently, Taekman’s actions made Bethenny laugh throughout the episode. “My favorite moment was Kristen grabbing for the wine. That was physical comedy, and I'm not sure if you heard but when Dorinda was leaving the restaurant like a hot mess, you hear in the background Sonja saying \"what kind of vodka was that?\" Lol, I enjoyed this scene,” Frankel adds. It will be interesting to see how the women deal with one another during the Real Housewives of New York reunion, which filmed in New York yesterday. What do you think of Bethenny Frankel calling out her co-stars?",

    "LabBody": "Carlos Arturo Torres Tovar of the Umeå Institute of Design helped create an ingenious prosthetic that can be modified—all that's needed are some LEGO bricks. Called the IKO, the design comes with a four-fingered (non-LEGO) hand prosthetic. What makes it different from other prosthetics is that the person using it can remove the hand and construct whatever he or she desires out of LEGO bricks to replace it, leading to infinite possibilities. It is designed to help with the psychological aspects of needing a prosthetic, which is something that is often overlooked. In a video promoting the new invention, the designer works with a Colombian boy named Dario. The goal was to make a playful experience for Dario, one that would allow him him to create, explore, and be a typical kid. It's hoped that the prosthetic will make it easier for kids to interact with other children while breaking down barriers that might stand in the way of confidence.

    "LabBody": "When the temperature soars, gardeners typically outdoor work early or late when it’s a little cooler. This reduces the chance of various forms of physical injury and emotional defeat. The same consideration should be given to plants. Certain practices need to be performed when the environmental conditions are right to reduce plant damage. Pest management is a big one. If you plan to treat a plant for a pest, check the label for the recommended temperature ranges for spraying. Spraying a plant at 2 p.m. in 90-plus temperatures can bring a plant to its knees. These conditions can cause leaf burn at the very least. Also, make sure the pest is truly harmful and at a population high enough to cause significant damage. Choose a pesticide that is easy on the environment and will give good control. If a foliar spray is warranted, spray early or late in the day when the wind speed is low. Make sure the plant has been well watered and isn’t suffering from heat, drought or other forms of stress which can worsen the damage. While it isn’t exciting, reading the label and following directions can help avoid plant damage and environmental damage. Foliar fertilizing is another activity to avoid in the middle of a hot, sunny day. If the plant is pest, heat or drought stressed, give it time to recover before fertilizing. Fertilizer isn’t a cure-all for stressed plants, in fact, it can actually cause more stress. If using a dry granular fertilizer, make sure the soil is moist before applying and follow with a good irrigation. Using a herbicide on weeds? Make sure they are stress free and avoid the middle of the day spray. Weeds need to be healthy and stress free for a herbicide to work correctly. If the soil is dry and the conditions are hot, dry and windy...wait for better conditions. Stressed weeds can’t take up the herbicide properly so it is often wasted time, money and effort. Trenching, digging, and other repair or construction activities around the root system of plants should be avoided during the heat of summer. Fall, winter and spring are much better times to disturb the root system if that has to happen. Roots grow laterally in the soil, not straight down. So even if you are digging away from the trunk or stem of a plant, if it is inside or near the dripline you can be damaging the roots. If it’s just a few roots it shouldn’t cause significant harm, but if it involves a good deal of the roots, then wait for better conditions. Sprinkle irrigation is another activity that should be avoided in the middle of the day, especially if the irrigation water is high in salts. This harmful practice can lead to yellowing, leaf browning and defoliation depending on the plant, irrigation water quality, temperature and humidity. In addition to causing leaf damage, day time sprinkler irrigation is more prone to drift and evaporate. So, give your plants a break by sprinkle irrigating during the early morning, late evening or nighttime hours. Find re-leaf for your plants by timing your cultural practices to coincide with good growing conditions. \u003e\u003e Debbie Frost is a local horticulturist specializing in regionally appropriate horticulture, garden.frost@gmail.com. \u003e\u003e Debbie Frost is a local horticulturist specializing in regionally appropriate horticulture, garden.frost@gmail.com.",

    "LabBody": "At E3 2015, not only was there a significant increase in the number of women presenting games at the expo's big press conferences, but the games themselves saw more playable female characters come to the fore. Here's a look at the biggest games with the biggest female names attached to them. A note on how we decided which games to include: we only picked games whose playable female protagonists are unique characters unto themselves. This means games where you have the option to play as a male or female version of the same character, such as Mass Effect: Andromeda, Fallout 4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops III, aren't included. However, games where a choice between a male and female player exists with those two protagonists being unique and separate characters, are included. Though DICE is being quite heavy-handed in its positioning of Faith as \"a catalyst for change\" (geddit?), it's interesting that the developer has made the character powerful and self-sufficient without allowing her to even pick up guns this time around. In Mirror's Edge Catalyst, Faith fights on her own terms. Emily Kaldwin in Dishonored 2. Daughter to Dishonored protagonist Corvo Attano and Empress of the Isles, Emily Kaldwin is a playable character is Dishonored 2 alongside her father. Not only will choosing to play as her offer unique perspectives on each mission, but she has an entirely new set of otherworldly powers that are separate from Corvo's. There is little else that's more badass than fighting robotic dinosaurs with a bow and arrow, but that's daily life for Aloy in Horizon: Zero Dawn. We see her training, crafting, and ultimately hunting her mechanical prey with agility, guile, and a variety of different arrow types. Her dialogue suggests she belongs to the game's oldest, more advanced tribe. Lara Croft established herself as a strong-willed survivor in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot. With that origin story complete, we're now going to see her transformation into her eponymous role in Rise of the Tomb Raider. While a survivor is always on the back foot, this time around Lara seems more of the active adventurer: smarter, and more experienced. Jewel in ReCore. A new IP from the creators of Mega Man and Metroid Prime, ReCore follows a character named Jewel and her robotic dog companion, who is trying to help her bring humanity back to the game's planet. Jewel must explore the planet's sand-swept surface and dark underground vaults while retrieving robotic cores to activate new companions. Evie Frye was announced as a playable protagonist when Assassin's Creed: Syndicate was revealed, but it wasn't until E3 2015 that we actually saw her in action. In contrast to her brawler brother, Jacob, Evie offers more stealth-focused gameplay, and her missions take a more investigative tone than the street-level fist-fights we saw previously. Senua in Hellblade. Developer Ninja Theory is exploring mental health and psychosis through Senua, the main character of the studio's new game, Hellblade. You'll explore the depths of Senua's mind as the symptoms of our own mental issues are represented in the world itself, or heard through voices in her head. Those representations will become more literal as the game progresses.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "Sidekicks rarely shine when thrust into the spotlight, but what about a few hundred of them? The Minions, having been the best part of the two previous \"Despicable Me\" movies, have swarmed the screen in \"Minions.\" As candidates for center stage, they are seemingly ill-suited. Slavishly — if rarely competently — devoted lackeys, they're underlings by both definition and verticality. They don't speak intelligibly, which, to be fair, isn't a bar all of Hollywood's leading men reach. Instead, they talk in a bright babble that belies their fondness for colorful phonetics. \"Banana\" and \"piñata\" are their kind of words. Their unsuitability for the lead role, or just about anything else, is much of the fun of \"Minions,\" a happy henchmen overload that largely succeeds in its simple mission: More Minions! Directed by Pierre Coffin (who co-directed \"Despicable Me\" one and two and voices the Minions) and Kyle Balda, \"Minions\" begins in fine form. The little yellow ones are already humming the Universal theme as the film begins. With Geoffrey Rush narrating, we get the history of the Minions, which stretches back across eons and begins with them — a curios early mammal — literally walking out of the sea. But the evolution stops there. For thousands of years, we see, they've been letting down their evil masters, from a Tyrannosaurus Rex accidentally tipped into a volcano, to Dracula, whom they excitedly wake with a birthday cake and wide-open blinds. The Minions have their own Ice Age, however, ending up leaderless in Antarctica. After a few hundred years, the joy of snow ball fights beginning to dim, three of them — Kevin, Bob and Stuart — set out on a quest to find a new supervillain to idolize. Soon, they're on their way to Villain-Con, a riff on Comic-Con only a convention celebrating the likes of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), an evil world-conqueror in a beehive. The trio inadvertently wins a job in Overkill's entourage, and they're soon enmeshed in her plan to take the British throne, along with Overkill's inventor, Herb (Jon Hamm). There are, it should be noted, more ambitious seats of power to set one's diabolical sights on. But this is 1960s Swinging London, a colorful if over-familiar backdrop, and the goggle-wearing Minions could just as well be chipper Mods. The irreverent slapstick unfortunately gives way to the kind of action set pieces that have now even corrupted children's movies. The bombast, though never serious, is still loud enough to, for too long, drown out the best thing the movie has going for it: The chuckles and squeaks of the Minions. It also makes it harder to hear the other key sound accompanying the Minions: the laughter of children. What are the Minions but stand-ins for kids? Mumbling half-understood words by the mouthful, they plunge headlong into any task, usually wielding a dangerous object they shouldn't. Nothing makes them double over like a good pratfall, and they will insist on a goodnight kiss or bedtime story. Teaming and relentless, they will melt the heart of any guardian, even a supervillain. Coming on the heels of Pixar's \"Inside Out,\" an emotional wallop that most knocks out misty-eyed adults, \"Minions\" is a different beast. This one's for the kids. \"Minions,\" a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"action and rude humor.\" Running time: 91 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

    "LabBody": "By CASSIDY SWANSONNew Hampshire Correspondent. — As the first small, commercial lending bank to open in the United States in six years, Primary Bank, set to open on July 28, is attracting national media attention.Kayla Tausche, co-anchor of CNBC’s “Squawk Alley,” was at Primary Bank, located in the Route 101 Plaza, on Thursday morning to talk with chairman Bill Greiner about his newest business venture.“It’s not every day you see someone get the gumption and drum up the support within the community to actually build an institution,” Tausche said. “It’s very unique.”Greiner and his partner, Primary Bank’s President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Stone, are preparing to open the bank after exceeding their startup capital goal of $25 million by an additional $2 million.“It’s a big deal because since ’09, you’ve had 1,300 banks that have been bought out or merged,” Greiner said, adding that most closures and mergers are a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. “If that continues unabated, you’re going to be left with just big banks, and that’s not good.”Greiner, who is a stakeholder in the Great New Hampshire Restaurants group and a real estate developer, decided to get into the banking business after Citizens Bank, whom he worked with previously, announced they would not be providing loans in markets where the value of commercial real estate loans is under $20 million.“That’s pretty much taking you out of New Hampshire. There’s maybe 10 of those a year in our state,” Greiner said. “As that continues to happen, nobody comes in and backfills that. Who’s going to service the $2.5 million guys like me?”Greiner says he hopes Primary Bank will fill that void left by larger banks.“A $300,000 loan or line of credit means nothing to a $10 billion bank. It means everything to a small, community bank,” he said. “And there’s more relationships that go with a small loan like that, so I think that’s the real opportunity.”Tausche said the opening of Primary Bank is “a sign of confidence in the economy.”“The fact that there is demand in a community like this, for people to be taking out new loans, means that there’s a lot of confidence about small business in any given economy,” Tausche said. “We frankly hadn’t seen that for several years.With low interest rates in place for so long, the prospect of creating a profitable bank has seemed less promising, Tausche said.“I think there were not a lot of people who were willing to take that leap, because they weren’t sure that there community would borrow from the bank, and they wouldn’t be able to make money from it,” she said. “The fact that now that’s happening is a big deal.”Primary Bank will be open for business on July 28 with a grand opening scheduled for July 31.

    "LabBody": "by Erika Carter 7/10/15. Have you ever wondered how they make those beautiful tomato flowers? You know the ones, you see them on the buffet tables all the time? They’re beautiful, almost like a work of art. Well, to accomplish this you just need a few simple things: A sharp paring knife, cutting board or other flat surface and a medium sized tomato. The key to successfully learning how to make a tomato rose is by using the right tool. A sharp paring knife is essential, as it allows you to control the depth and direction of your cuts. A dull blade will make it virtually impossible to create a pretty tomato flower. You make your cuts diagonally. You cut into the tomato, about 2.5 inches down, all around in a “V” pattern. When that is done, you pull the pieces apart and there’s a beautiful rose. You can enhance this by cutting down a little further. It almost looks like a rose sitting on a lily pad. Even further, you can cut the skin and it enhances the beauty of the flower. Generally, I would buy vine ripened tomatoes because they seem to be a prettier shade of red and of a good size. But wouldn’t this be beautiful to have a sea of tomato flowers made out of heirloom tomatoes, in many sizes and colors. And, of course, they would be delicious. If it is true that we eat with our eyes first, then this would be a virtual feast. SHARE the love and pass it on! Did You Like This Story? Tap Below.",

    "DiffbotBody": "The superintendent got a vote of confidence. He deserves the Medal of Honor IN A VOTE of confidence, the School Reform Commission last week said it owed Superintendent William Hite what it called a \"performance bonus.\" It should have been called combat pay. That's the extra pay given to members of the U.S. military who serve in \"designated combat zones or hazardous duty areas.\" That pretty much describes the Philadelphia School District, certainly in 2012 when Hite took over after the SRC fired Superintendent Arlene Ackerman. They were perilous times, certainly for the students in the District. The state has slashed about $500 million in aid, creating a huge hole in the district's budget. A round of layoffs - that would continue for several years - was just beginning. Ackerman, whose imperious style earned her the nickname \"Queen Arlene,\" had a knack for making enemies, so the District had few friends in the outside world, especially among the politicians who controlled the purse strings. Hite was the calm after the Ackerman storm. A Virginian with a courtly manner, Hite began his career as a classroom teacher, rising through the ranks to become superintendent of public schools in Prince George's County, in Maryland. It was a large district, though nothing could fully prepare him for the challenge of running an urban school district in the battlefield called Philadelphia. What he was able to draw upon are character traits that make him a good leader. He has offered a consistency of vision, a pro-child and pro-parent agenda, a genuine belief that every child can learn and a determination about making real change in how schools operate in this city. What Hite also brought to the table was a personality that won over critics. He never raises his voice. He never points his finger to blame. He exhibits patience and forbearance - even in the face of screaming protesters or angry lawmakers. Instead, he has countered with a call for \"shared sacrifices\" by all parties involved in education in the city to pull the District out of the hole it fell into before he arrived. We can't say he has succeeded, but that failure is due to forces outside of his control. With the notable exception of Mayor Nutter, he has not gotten much from the political class. He's still at loggerheads with the teachers union over concessions he's sought. Financially, the district is no longer under siege but it's still a combat zone. Services are at a minimal level. Resources are scant. This week, Hite moved ahead with changes he had been planning centered on decentralizing power in the district, reasoning that if he waited for needed money to arrive he could be waiting forever. That is called optimism. He has restored the reputation to a system that was so lacking when he arrived. That is called credibility. He has consistently shown grace under pressure, which is one definition of courage. Hite makes a good salary. But, it's no surprise, given his performance, that the SRC wanted to give him a $60,000 bonus. And it's no surprise that Hite turned it down, saying it would be unfair given the district's finances. We call that leadership.",

    "LabBody": "TWIN FALLS • Anyone with a burning question for the Twin Falls Police Department can ask away Saturday. Twin Falls Police Department has decided to take part in the national program Coffee With A Cop. “We are trying to engage people outside of situations we usually encounter them in,” Capt. Matthew Hicks said. “As you can imagine we don’t always find people at their calmest.” Coffee With A Cop was founded in Hawthorn, Calif. by Capt. Keith Kauffman and Sgt. Chris Cognac of the Hawthorn Police Department in 2011. Since its inception, these events have been picked up across the country and in Australia and England. Anyone with a question or concern is invited to come have a one-on-one conversation with an officer from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Saturday at Twin Beans Coffee Company, 144 Main Ave. “I think it is important in this day and age for people to see officers in this light,” Hicks said. The police department hosts weekly presentations across town but officers wanted a forum that could provide more give and take. “Those tend to be more like speeches, which is great for relaying information but we wanted something more,” Hicks said. The Coffee With A Cop program has a four-hour training that police departments can attend to learn how to better engage the community. Twin Falls officers haven’t attended the training yet but plans to send some in the future. “The reality is this is four hours of the nuts and bolts of all the mistakes we’ve ever made hosting these events,” Kauffman said in a press release. Twin Falls plans to host similar events every two months at different coffee shops around town. “The agenda is decided by the people who come to the coffee shop that day and we talk about what they want to talk about,” Hicks said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "To the editor: The recent road bond election defeat, a patchwork of good and bad projects almost resulting in a huge, blatant waste of our tax dollars is but the latest example of county leaders hooked on spending. However, this is not just limited to the county leaders, as the local county school boards and township are just as guilty from free willing with our hard-earned dollars. And who really benefits from this irresponsible spending of our local treasury and indebtedness? Follow the money. In the road bond case, the “movers \u0026 shakers” of the county, along with the “outsiders” (wallets — engineering and consulting companies from Houston who support and get business from them), spent $1.04 million to elect the remainder (two) of a commissioners court that would tip the balance of power on the court in their direction, as well as for this latest road bond election. After a runoff last year for those two (Judge Doyal \u0026 Commissioner Riley), plus an insurance win in Jim Clark, they went to work immediately crafting a bond that would eventually give the appearance of favoritism and payback to the aforementioned supporters. People got wise to it and it didn’t work. In fact, it was defeated in a landslide. The people of The Woodlands, as well as 6,000 (38 percent of the voters against the bond) from outside of that community, awoke to give a resounding no. The defeat was so stinging that the judge lost the county vote and Commissioner Riley lost his own precinct (2). With all commissioners and the “who’s who” in the county supporting this patchwork bond, full of pork, it took all of the grassroots’ time and energy to make sure that the word got out about the 60 percent waste in it. What we didn’t have time to pursue, unfortunately, was the litmus test of mega-loans to come throughout the county … particularly the two in this same election cycle: the Montgomery and New Caney ISD bonds. While campaigning in the city of Montgomery against the road bond in early voting, I also had an occasion to talk to 3 of the 4 pro-($257 million) bond candidates running for the MISD school board, as well as the head of the PTO up there. The common theme was “the classrooms are overflowing and you can barely get to classes because the hallways are jammed.” Really. That bad? In the evening between the two days I was out there, I did some quick research. The first red flag that I found, while digging for the true indicator of a bond improvement (capacities — now/future) was that $55 million was going to be spent on operations and maintenance. But shouldn’t this be coming out of the exorbitant amount (nearly half of all of our property taxes go to) that we already pay? Sounds eerily like M\u0026O the in road bonds, too. In fact, projected elementary and middle schools, called for in the MISD bond, barely exceed capacity, if at all in the middle schools’ case — but not for another 10 years. A better case was made for the high school, if you believe the growth rates in the study. Consequently, at least half of the $205 million for the schools (or just over $100 million) could’ve waited five years at the earliest to gauge actual needs then. Seems to be a parallel to the pork in the road bond. If there’s anything the patchwork road and MISD bonds taught us, it is to look under the hood. That applies to both the upcoming CISD and Magnolia ISD bonds, especially when one considers that CISD is already $1 billion in debt and the state has up to a staggering $112 billion in school bond debt. And finally, while on the subject of misallocation of our tax dollars, is the “mounted patrol” in The Woodlands. With the $1.8 million contract for Alpha Omega “greeting/direction” services expiring Dec. 31, headed up by local VP Kathy Scoles (BTW wife of former Oak Ridge Mayor Gary Louie, who was shamelessly shilling for renewal of AO’s contract in the article), the township is going out with an RFP for bidders. Why is an abundance of our tax dollars going to a unique organization like this, that admittedly has no law enforcement capabilities and is mainly found geographically around the Town Center? Shouldn’t the businesses around there, who receive most of the benefit to this, be picking up the tab for the extra “security?” Or maybe even The Woodlands Convention and Visitors Bureau? And how does a business like Costco, miles away, qualify as the article suggested? Not many of our citizens object to leaders spending our tax dollars, if done wisely. However, it’s time that those same old/new leaders sober up from their years of binge-spending. As well, voters should continue looking under the hood of these “needed” projects. Trust ... but verify. John Wertz. Montgomery County Tea Party.",

The answer, it turns out, is that the Sheriff’s Department asked federal officials to do so. Mirkarimi’s agency requested custody of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez as he was completing a 46-month stint in federal prison in March in San Bernardino County, according to a Sheriff’s Department letter obtained by The Chronicle. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times to Mexico and had been imprisoned for illegally re-entering the U.S. The federal Bureau of Prisons alerted the Sheriff’s Department in March that Lopez-Sanchez was going to be released. Mirkarimi’s agency, realizing that Lopez-Sanchez was wanted on a $5,000 bench warrant related to a 1995 marijuana possession-for-sale case, asked prison officials March 23 to hold him and to notify San Francisco authorities “when the subject is ready for our pick-up.” “Also, please notify us if the hold cannot be placed or the named subject is released to another jurisdiction prior to our receipt,” said the letter, signed by Vic Gaerlan of the sheriff’s warrant bureau. Lopez-Sanchez arrived in San Francisco on March 26, and the marijuana case against him was discharged the following day. He was returned to jail, however. Prisoner in legal limbo For the next three weeks, sources with knowledge of the matter told The Chronicle, sheriff’s deputies sought clarification from the department’s legal division on whether to hold Lopez-Sanchez so Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials could pick him up for possible deportation. ICE had requested that the city detain Lopez-Sanchez. In the end, the legal division told deputies they had no basis to hold Lopez-Sanchez, and he was released April 15. He was arrested last week in the July 1 shooting death of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle on San Francisco’s waterfront, and has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. Mirkarimi’s office did not immediately comment on the letter. It initially scheduled a news conference for Thursday to “set the record straight” on Lopez-Sanchez’s release but called it off late Wednesday “out of respect for Kate Steinle’s funeral services.” In an interview Tuesday on KQED radio, the sheriff questioned why Lopez-Sanchez had been sent to the city. “We’re trying to understand why ICE returned Sanchez to San Francisco on a 20-year-old marijuana possession charge in a city that really doesn’t even prosecute marijuana possession … and knowing that he had been deported and illegally entered the country,” the sheriff said. Freya Horne, legal counsel for the Sheriff’s Department, told The Chronicle on Tuesday that her office had dispatched a private transportation outfit to pick up Lopez-Sanchez. “It seems kind of amazing that after all that time, he was brought back here for that purpose,” Horne said. Joseph Russoniello, former U.S. attorney in San Francisco, said the city’s request to take custody of such an offender was “very unusual.” He said sheriff’s officials could have checked with local prosecutors about the case and opted not to intervene. “They had the capability to examine the status of the file and determine whether or not to pursue the matter or move to cancel or withdraw the warrant,” he said. The Sheriff’s Department letter came to light on the same day that San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee attacked Mirkarimi, saying his decision to cut off even basic communication with federal immigration officials led to Lopez-Sanchez’s release. Mirkarimi has said a 2013 city law designed to protect people without immigration status — a law signed by Lee — mandated the April release after the local charges against him were dropped. But the mayor said the sheriff’s office could have satisfied both city and state law by simply picking up the phone and asking immigration agents to come over and pick up Lopez-Sanchez before the “serious, repeat” felon was set loose. “I’ve sent that message over to the Sheriff’s Department regarding communications with the federal authorities,” Lee said at a news conference. “Do we need to educate somebody on how to pick up the phone?” Lee said Mirkarimi “needs to read the entire ordinance” the mayor signed in 2013. The law prohibits most inmates suspected of being in the country illegally from being held for ICE after their scheduled jail release. The 48-hour holds are known as detainers. No law against discussion Lee said that rather than detaining an inmate post-release, it would be prudent and legal to turn him over earlier. “Nothing in this sanctuary-city law prohibits the officials of the city and county of San Francisco to communicate, to engage in discussion” with immigration officials before a person’s scheduled release, Lee said. The sheriff has said that his department cannot detain someone suspected to be in the country illegally without a warrant or a court order. And records show Mirkarimi cut off nearly all communications with ICE in spring 2014. In a brief response Wednesday to Lee, Mirkarimi told The Chronicle in a text message, “It really looks like the Mayor is running away from the 2013 law he signed into effect ... A law that I and our department adhere to. If he has had a change of legislative heart then he should’ve communicated this to me but then again I haven’t heard from him in three years despite my numerous letters and attempts to meet with him. I think it’s cowardly that he's placing politics before public safety.” Lee and Mirkarimi have butted heads since the mayor tried to oust the sheriff for his highly publicized domestic-violence-related conviction in 2012. Lee’s comments put him in step with federal immigration officials who have insisted that, had they merely been notified about the planned release of Lopez-Sanchez, they would have picked him up and taken him into custody for deportation. They said they had made clear to local authorities in California — including those who have refused to honor post-release detainers in recent years due to civil rights concerns — that they were looking to get such prerelease notifications. But Mirkarimi has limited his department’s cooperation with immigration agents in ways that go beyond the 2013 city ordinance signed by Lee. In May 2014, he announced in a news release that his department “will no longer honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers unless they are supported by judicial determination of probable cause” or an arrest warrant. A year later, Mirkarimi essentially cut off the type of communication that federal immigration officials are now seeking. Communication cut off He issued a memo March 13 stating that his staff was barred from giving immigration agents “information or access” to records about detainees — including their citizenship status, their booking and arrest documents, and their release dates. Before that, some deputies had informally called ICE about inmates who might be deportable. But deputies told The Chronicle that the new policy led to a complete stoppage of communication. Virginia Kice, an ICE spokeswoman, said courtesy notifications from San Francisco deputies dropped off dramatically in spring 2014. “By April 2014, it was standard practice for no cooperation and no phone calls,” Kice said. “We were not getting much stuff, over the transom or under the transom, at all. What stuff we were getting was few and far between at the very best.” The mayor said he cannot “order” city officials to communicate with federal officials about inmates who may be in the country illegally. But he said he has sent a strong message to members of the Board of Supervisors and other city officials that there should be cooperation — and direct communication — in serious cases.

The problem stemmed from an arrest of Dylann Roof in South Carolina weeks before the shooting in which police say he admitted to possessing illegal drugs. Under federal rules, that admission alone should have been enough to disqualify him from an April gun purchase. But, Comey said, the FBI background check examiner who evaluated Roof's request to buy a gun never saw the arrest report because the wrong arresting agency was listed on the list rap sheet that she reviewed. The transaction went through after three days because the examiner didn't have enough information to authorize or deny it. \"If she had seen that police report,\" Comey said, \"that purchase would have been denied.\" Comey said he learned about the problem on Thursday night and that FBI officials planned to meet Friday with relatives of the nine victims of last month's church shooting in Charleston. He said he had also directed an internal 30-day review into how the FBI uses criminal background checks in gun transactions. His announcement came within hours of the Confederate flag's removal from the South Carolina Statehouse. Families of the victims attended the ceremony.",

    "LabBody": "SOUTH BEND — Organizers of Bike the Bend, the popular bicycle ride through South Bend and Mishawaka that drew almost 2,000 participants last month, have canceled next year's ride after a rift with city police. Organizers pinned the decision on the dearth of help from South Bend police officers, claiming the local lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police told its officers to avoid helping the event in retaliation to criticism of the officers' assistance last year. Only two South Bend officers ended up working the event last month. In a news conference Thursday at downtown's Seitz Park, organizers — led by founder Yatish Joshi and Glenda Lamont, president of Bike the Bend — said relations with city police are too damaged. Lamont said organizers couldn't \"take a chance\" that even one injury might happen, especially when 25 percent of the riders are children. They provided a copy of an email in May that South Bend Lt. Gene Eyster, who oversees traffic enforcement, had sent to a Bike the Bend liaison: \"You are correct that the Fraternal Order of Police has recommended to its membership to consider not volunteering to work the Bike the Bend event. This request was made based on the disparaging remarks about the professionalism and job performance made by your organization to the City after last year’s event.” But the FOP's president, Sgt. Dan Demler, responded in a statement that few officers chose to help this year because they were swamped since the event came on the tails of the city's big 150th birthday bash. \"It’s a matter of choosing personal time over an extra shift,\" he said. The ride called for almost 50 officers, or about 20 percent of the police force. To alleviate that, Demler said, police had suggested pushing the event to May or the fall. \"Bike the Bend organizers showed little willingness to consider the concerns expressed or changes suggested by officers, who have extensive experience serving in a wide variety of events,\" he said in the statement. All of this comes after an event in June that, by most accounts, went smoothly in its sixth year and didn't see any major injuries, thanks to a surge of volunteers — 125 in all — who stepped up after Bike the Bend put out a last-minute plea for help with guiding cyclists at 26 key intersections in South Bend. The event asked police to block off traffic, which is an unusual request for bike rides. According to Bike the Bend organizers, problems first arose after the 2014 event, as riders and volunteers complained about \"serious and careless disregard (by officers) for the safety of riders at seven South Bend intersections.\" They said the complaints were limited to only a few South Bend officers and didn't apply to officers from neighboring departments. The issues at the seven intersections led organizers to subtract $2,523 from a bill of $10,890 that they reimbursed to the city for South Bend officers' help last year. Bike the Bend has always paid the city for the officers, who earned time-and-a-half wages or compensatory time. In his statement, Demler said that wasn't fair: \"Even if one is unhappy with the level of service, when an agreement is made and an employee shows up and performs his or her duties, one cannot decide to withhold compensation. In the planning stages, police officers serve as partners with organizers, not their employees, offering our expertise in promoting public safety to help make an event a success.\" 'Never say never' Even this year's event was in jeopardy, according to Joshi and Lamont. They said they were ready to cancel after receiving the complaints from the 2014 ride. They alerted South Bend Police Chief Ron Teachman and then-Deputy Mayor Mark Neal in a June 2014 letter, pointing out the riders' complaints about some lax police coverage and a \"lack of diligence\" by the city parks department to ease safety hazards on the East Bank Trail. They said there had been \"inconsistent public safety services in the past\" and wrote that the ride wouldn't go on \"unless there's a transformation in the City's attitude.\" They decided to move forward after some police and city officials gave their approval for the 2015 route. It wasn't until May, organizers say, that they heard a rumor that the FOP was discouraging its members from helping. In a news conference at the time, Chief Teachman speculated that officers were merely fatigued from the sharp increase of special events that required police presence this year. Those events had increased from 73 in 2012 to a projected 305 this year, he said. \"What's been happening is over the past few years, special events have exploded,\" he said at that time. \"Not all of them can we staff with police officers. It takes a toll on our most valuable asset: Our people and their families.\" As it turned out on June 14, the ride received help from neighboring police departments: five from St. Joseph County Police, three from the University of Notre Dame, five from the Mishawaka Police Department and six members of South Bend's Volunteers in Policing unit, organizers report. Joshi faults not only the officers but also the city's administration for not forcing South Bend police to cooperate. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's spokeswoman, Kara Kelly, said the city worked closely with Bike the Bend organizers \"to try to arrive at a realistic public safety plan, and played an active role to help ensure the 2015 event went forward.\" Ultimately, though, special events \"are a voluntary public safety assignment for officers, and this policy is not unique to Bike the Bend,\" she said. Kelly also backed Teachman's account, saying, \"There’s no question that the rise in special events has played a role in the availability of public safety officers and can put a strain on the system.\" Would organizers resurrect the ride if the issues can be rectified? \"Never say never,\" Joshi replied. \"For this one, we have no plans to come back.\" Demler, of the police union, said, \"We remain open to working with Bike the Bend organizers in the future.\" Regardless of the annual spring ride, Bike the Bend, as a nonprofit organization, will go on, Lamont said. More than $58,000 has been given back to the community since it began, most recently to help develop the Indiana Michigan River Valley Trail and the LaSalle Trail.",

The three-way junction at South Milton Road and West Route 66 was the most dangerous intersection in Flagstaff in 2014. According to CompStat reports compiled by the Flagstaff Police Department, there were 39 collisions at the South Milton Road and West Route 66 intersection last year. “I don’t think it’s news to folks that it is a dangerous intersection,” said FPD spokesperson Sgt. Margaret Bentzen. This year’s most dangerous intersection did not even make the top 10 list in 2013, when South Milton Road at West Butler Avenue had the most collisions. This year, that intersection fell to No. 11 on the dangerous intersections list with 16 collisions. Most of the top 10 dangerous intersections on this year’s list were along Flagstaff’s main drag, which winds across town from South Milton Road to East Route 66 and Highway 89. Bentzen said the large volume of daily traffic on those roads is a major factor in the number of collisions. Red light violations and following too closely are the two most common violations officers see. Citywide, there were 2,125 non-injury collisions in 2014, 74 fewer than the previous year. However, the number of injury collisions rose from 352 in 2013 to 411 in 2014. There were three fatal crashes in both years. --Michelle McManimon. Copyright 2015 Arizona Daily Sun.

    "LabBody": "As Dieter Regett drove through Jasper National Park on Friday, it was “eerily quiet,” not even a squirrel to be seen in an area usually teeming with wildlife. “It was like driving through soup. It was all smokey and it was very smelly — that burnt smell — through the entire area,” Regett said, as he watched a helicopter fly toward a wildfire burning out of control in the Maligne Valley. Around 5,000 hectares large, the fire had forced several campgrounds and trails to be evacuated of visitors. Regett, a driver with Sun Dog Tours, helped Parks Canada Friday morning shuttle staff to pick up cars abandoned at campsites by guests who had been evacuated by helicopter or quad. David Arsenault was playing cards when a helicopter landed in the alpine meadow near his tent at a backcountry campground off Skyline trail in Maligne Valley. Arsenault wasn’t surprised when he was told he’d be evacuated the next morning; he’d seen the smoke. “It was like a big white cloud coming over the ridge of the mountain and it just kind of kept billowing and billowing and getting bigger,” Arsenault said. “Then you realize it’s not a cloud.” Maligne Lake Road, Skyline trail between the valley and canyon, the canyon and hostel, and Jacques Lake trail are all closed. The park is open to visitors but under a fire ban until further notice. The wildfire is moving south, away from the town of Jasper 15 kilometres to the north, park spokeswoman Kim Weir said Friday. “There’s hopefully no risk to the community at this point,” Weir said. Due to favourable weather conditions, the fire remained roughly the same size Friday — its growth slowing considerably — but that could change if weather conditions do. The fire started around 3:30 p.m. Thursday near Excelsior Creek in the Maligne Valley and was burning northwest of Medicine Lake, a glacial-fed lake. Lightning likely struck and smouldered underground until the dryness and heat let it spark a wildfire, she said. It’s being fought using aerial attacks only because it’s too dangerous on the ground. This weekend’s predicted cooler weather and rain should help, she said. Sprinklers have been set up to soak Parks Canada buildings, but nothing was in danger of burning as of Friday night. Though the park is still open, visitors should be aware that an abundance of smoke, caused by an inversion in the valley, could exacerbate the symptoms of some health conditions, such as asthma. Park officials estimate they have evacuated 1,000 people from the Maligne Valley area over the past two days. Crews from Manitoba are expected to arrive on Saturday and Sunday. The devastation of “nature, in all its pristineness,” was obvious north of Medicine Lake, Regett said. The fire had “jumped the road, exploded some of the trees” and knocked rocks onto the road. That destruction of “one of the most beautiful places in Canada” was hard to see, he said. “It makes you feel a little insignificant ... when nature unleashes something like that.” With files from Madeleine Cummings.",

    "LabBody": "With an eclectic mix of renowned performers on the schedule, organizers of the Maudslay Arts Center Summer Concert Series are looking forward to a banner 23rd season. “This is the best lineup we’ve had in years,” said Nick Costello Jr., executive director of the arts center. “It starts strong and it finishes strong, so you won’t find anything that wouldn’t be considered a great concert opportunity here.” Jazz singer Rebecca Parris will open this year’s series on Saturday night at Maudslay State Park in Newburyport with her clear vocals and soulful standards. Accompanied by her jazz trio — including Emmy-winning composer Brad Hatfield on the keyboard — Parris starts her shows with universal narratives like love and loss and moves on from there. “My first concern is the lyric and the story,” Parris said. “All the tunes that are written are universal, all of the standards that I sing, we’ve all been through by the age of 28 or 30. If you look deep into those lyrics, you’re going to find so much of your own life in there.” She’s been training for this role for practically her entire life, having been born the daughter of a church organist and a concert pianist, both of whom wore additional musical hats when necessary. She jokes that she became accustomed to liturgical music in the womb and used to chase her mother around the room singing made-up children’s hymns. But it’s her uncle who truly began her study of music: David Blair McClosky may not be a household name, but John F. Kennedy admirers will recognize him as the president’s campaign voice coach. The founder of the McClosky Institute of Voice and a former opera singer, McClosky walked a 7-year-old Parris down the first steps into opera and bucked her to follow in his footsteps. Parris grew up to study opera at The Boston Conservatory, but she also found herself drawn into the wilds of musical theater and pop. She spent well over a decade singing for various pop bands and even spent a year in hard rock — “I almost killed myself vocally” — but eventually waded into the mellow waters of jazz vocals. “I found myself with material that made sense, that had some depth,” she said, “that had wonderful chord charges and terrific melody lines, brought me back into my theater teaching. ... I could bring everything that I’ve learned over the past 30 years to put into this new music.” With decades of experience behind her, the singer often referred to as “Boston’s first lady of jazz” is planning for Saturday an eclectic affair of jazz standards, Brazilian hits and even a few “goodbye” songs that she’s been preparing in honor of a dear friend who’s leaving for her homeland in Holland. More music is on tap for Sunday afternoon, when Aeterna Trio will return after making its Maudslay Arts Center debut last year. Concerts then continue nearly every Saturday and Sunday night — with the exception of Yankee Homecoming — through Aug. 23. Proceeds from the performances will go to the arts center, founded in 1992 as a nonprofit dedicated to bringing community members, visitors and artists together in Maudslay Park. The concert series and other center activities are funded by a combination of ticket sales, sponsorships (primarily the Newburyport Five Cents Savings Bank), and rentals for weddings and other events throughout the year. “The arts don’t pay for themselves, they never do,” said Costello, whose father, Nick Costello Sr., founded the center with Jim Gaines and former Mayor Edward Molin. “But what the arts do provide is an enrichment to the community and an opportunity for the community to get together and be involved.” The venue is a renovated barn and patio set sitting on an expansive lawn bordered by a stand of Norwegian maples and, of course, the natural beauty of the 488-acre park. Patio seating for 200 puts fans right in front of the stage, just feet from the performers, and lawn seating allows for picnic blankets surrounding the stage on all sides. “It’s hard to explain how intimate it is,” Costello said. “You really can be right there with the performer, even if you’re on the lawn. You sit out there under the stars and listen to great music; there’s nothing like it.” Helping keep the arts center alive for nearly 25 years is a full community of volunteers, including Costello’s parents. Publicists, gardeners and even the carpenters who keep the building together all donate their time, as well. “It has come so far,” Costello said. “It’s been a labor of love to all those people over the years. We would not be where we are if it weren’t for the volunteers.” If you go. What: Maudslay Arts Center Summer Concert Series.

    "LabBody": "The fight over Oklahoma’s current beer laws has caused Anheuser-Busch, the maker of some of the most popular beers in the country, to withdraw its membership from Beer Distributors of Oklahoma, an advocacy group for beer distributors in the state. The Beer Distributors of Oklahoma (BDO) countered by accusing Anheuser-Busch of laying off employees at the Premium Beers of Oklahoma distributorship in Oklahoma City after purchasing it from the Cresap family three years ago. In a press release issued by Anheuser-Busch, the company said “our definition of and path toward modernization does not align with the Beer Distributors of Oklahoma.” Eric James, senior director for sales and marketing for Anheuser-Busch sales of Oklahoma, did not specify the nature of the company’s dispute with the distributors group. Instead, he specified what the company would like to see happen in Oklahoma. “Anheuser-Busch would like to see cold, single-strength beer available to consumers in Oklahoma,” he said. Currently, Oklahoma law dictates beer sold outside of liquor stores must be no stronger than 3.2 percent alcohol by weight. Beer sold in liquor stores can be stronger but cannot be refrigerated. Oklahoma is only one of five states that require the sale of 3.2 beer in certain circumstances, with the others including Kansas, Colorado, Utah and Minnesota. James said changing that law would give the opportunity for brewers to sell a greater variety of beer, and give consumers more choice. “We feel that, after careful consideration, it’s in our best interest to separate from the BDO,” James said. “This gives us the freedom and flexibility to move forward on our views of modernization.” The Beer Distributors of Oklahoma responded in an emailed statement, saying Anheuser-Busch’s move came as “no surprise.” “With the recent losses of the Monster and Constellation brands, the two Anheuser-Busch owned distributorships in Oklahoma City and Tulsa have been losing market share and struggling to execute in the marketplace while at the same time trying to control costs through reductions in Oklahoma jobs,” the statement said. The BDO statement also accused Anheuser-Busch of selling beer against their own independent distributors in the same territory. The statement also said the BDO believes voters should decide what kind of modernization would come to beer distributors. “The BDO is committed to providing all Oklahomans with their choice of beer, strong or low point, through an open and independent distribution system,” the statement said. The move does not affect the availability of Anheuser-Busch products in the state. Anheuser-Busch, a subsidiary of Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev since 2008, brews brands including Budweiser, Michelob, Rolling Rock, Busch, Shock Top, LandShark, Goose Island, Blue Point, 10 Barrel and Elysian. A push to loosen the beer laws is already under way. Senate Bill 383, put forward by Sen. Stephanie Bice, R-Oklahoma City, would allow single-strength, cold beer. The Oklahoma Legislature sent it to a conference committee before ending the legislative session.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Today, it starts to get really real for the more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants that work for Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV). Today the flight attendants were — for the first time — presented with the full details of the tentative contract approved last week by the 17-member executive board of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, including more than 1,800 domiciled in Chicago. News of the sudden tentative agreement has exposed deep rifts in relations between flights attendants and their elected executive board and with Southwest management, who now appear eager to get a deal with their largest single group of unionized employees. As of late today, some Southwest flight attendants are still digesting all of the contract's complicated details and getting \"educated\" about the tentative contract by hand-picked union representatives stationed in crew lounges at major airports throughout the Southwest network. But to some seasoned veteran rank-and-file Southwest flight attendants, the new contract appears a mix of gains and losses. But on whole, many are saying that key losses outlined in the new contract may in fact outweigh the gains the tentative contract does include. One concern expressed in emails to this reporter today from flight attendants who have now seen the full contract is the absence of retroactive pay raises for the two years that Local 556 has been negotiating to get a new contract. Flight attendants will get 3 percent raises in 2015 (starting as soon as a contract is ratified) and in 2017 and 2019, raises that are barely at — or possibly below— inflation levels in some regions, flight attendants argue. In years 2016 and 2018, flight attendants would instead get a 3 percent annual bonus, that would subsequently be taxed at 40 percent. And some flight attendants are upset about the new way vacation benefits will be calculated under terms of the proposed contract — a complicated system that will create a more defined two-tier culture of full-time and part-time employees at the airline. The new contract also calls for longer duty day hours for flight attendants in some instances, rising from 10.5 hours to 12 hours — which was not what many flight attendants were hoping to see in a new contract. But even much smaller things in the proposed contract are being viewed as losses by some flight attendants. They include a new provision that requires flight attendants to report for duty 45 minutes before the schedule departure of flights on Southwest's new — and much larger — Boeing 737-800 series aircraft that seats approximately 30 more passengers than the Boeing 737-700 series model. Previously, flight attendants were required to be at the plane 30 minutes before departure. Southwest Airlines is expected to add many more 737-800 aircraft to its fleet starting next year. One truly veteran Southwest Airlines flight attendant who has clocked well over 30 years with the carrier had this to say today after reading through the new proposed contract: \"I have seen enough and compared to our previous contract language to know for certain this is a concessionary contract. Also, even though there is no defined contract language for retroactive pay, it has always been negotiated for our flight attendants going back to the date the contract expired (in 2013 in this instance). There is no retro pay, just a signing bonus (in the proposed contract). The bonus is taxed at 40 percent.\" Other flight attendants I heard from today point the finger directly at Southwest management, including CEO Gary Kelly, for all the angst the new proposed contract is generating among flight attendants as they prepare to vote on it. Noted one flight attendant: \"The negative publicity Gary Kelly is getting in the media is exactly what he wants to sweep under the rug. He thrives on feeling everyone is behind him 100 percent. I really think he has lost contact with the real world.\" A spokesman for Local 556 did not return a call seeking comment today or provide a copy of the tentative contract agreed to by Local 556's executive board and Southwest Airlines management.",

    "LabBody": "Ken Stabler, who led the Oakland Raiders to a Super Bowl victory and was the NFL’s Most Valuable Player in 1974, has died as a result of complications from colon cancer. He was 69. His family announced his death on Stabler’s Facebook page on Thursday. The statement said Stabler “passed peacefully” on Wednesday while surrounded by family, including his three daughters and longtime partner, who wasn’t named. Raiders owner Mark Davis said the team was “deeply saddened by the passing of the great Ken Stabler.” “He was a cherished member of the Raider family and personified what it means to be a Raider,” Davis said in a statement. “He wore the Silver and Black with Pride and Poise and will continue to live in the hearts of Raider fans everywhere. Our sincerest thoughts and prayers go out to Kenny’s family.” Stabler’s coach with the Raiders, John Madden, said his former quarterback was cool under pressure. “I’ve often said, if I had one drive to win a game to this day, and I had a quarterback to pick, I would pick Kenny,” Madden said. “Snake was a lot cooler than I was. He was a perfect quarterback and a perfect Raider. When you think about the Raiders you think about Ken Stabler. Kenny loved life. It is a sad day for all Raiders.” Stabler was a four-time Pro Bowl selection with the Raiders, leading the franchise to consistent success during the 1970s, including a 32-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the 1977 Super Bowl. The family’s statement said he was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer in February. Stabler’s favorite songs were playing, from Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” to Van Morrison’s “Leaves Falling Down,” the family said. His brain and spinal cord were donated to Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center to support research into degenerative brain disease among athletes, according to the family. “He was a kind, generous and unselfish man, never turning down an autograph request or an opportunity to help someone in need,” the family said. “A great quarterback, he was an even greater father to his three girls, and grandfather to his two ‘grand snakes.’” The Foley, Alabama, native threw for 27,938 career yards over 15 seasons, which also included stints with the Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints. During his college career, Stabler led Alabama to an undefeated 1966 season and was chosen the Sugar Bowl MVP after a 34-7 rout of Nebraska. He also ran for a long touchdown on a rain-soaked field during the 1967 Iron Bowl to lead the Tide to a 7-3 win over Auburn. Alabama coach Nick Saban got to know Stabler from golf tournaments and the ex-Raiders quarterback’s stint as an analyst on Alabama radio broadcasts. “I think anyone who had the chance to get to know Kenny would appreciate the great person he was and the pride he had for the University of Alabama,” Saban said in a statement. “I have had the chance to be around some of the best to ever play college and pro football, and Kenny may have been one of the greatest competitors to ever play the game.”",

In addition to the show endorsement deals with Diet Pepsi, Covergirl, Rooms to Go and thyroid medicine Synthroid make her one of the most in-demand spokespeople as marketers hope to capture her high-wattage crossover appeal. Vergara's Kmart-based line of clothing and home goods continues to thrive and is credited with increasing the retailer's market share with the Hispanic community. Vergara is also the executive producer on the forthcoming ABC show Killer Women. Total earnings: $30 million. (Forbes)",

As Scandal's Olivia Pope, Washington has the distinction of being the first Afircan American actress to play a lead in a prime-time drama since the 1960s--and the Shonda Rhimes show is a certified hit for ABC, averaging 8.3 million viewers each week and earning an estimated $100 million in ad revenue this season. Oh--and Washington's been nom'd for an Emmy. The actress had a banner year: in addition to the success of Scandal she took a lead role in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained and starred in Tyler Perry's Peeples. Look for Washington to mount this list in 2014: in addition to a salary increase she'll begin to enjoy earnings off of a unique (and early) syndication deal: starting this fall each episode of Scandal is expected to air on BET no earlier than eight days after its original broadcast. Total earnings: $3 million (Forbes)",

    "LabBody": "The King and Queen of morning television are together again! It was announced on Thursday's edition of 'Today' on NBC that Regis Philbin, who has made guest appearances in recent months on the fourth hour of the program, will be joining the show as a special contributor. The move means Philbin will now be appearing next to former co-star Kathie Lee Gifford on a regular basis. Philbin and Gifford dominated the morning airwaves on 'Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee' from 1985 to 2000 on ABC. Gifford left 'Live' to spend more time with her family in 2000, and Philbin followed suit in 2011. Gifford returned to TV in 2008, as co-host of the 'Today' show's fourth hour alongside Hoda Kotb, and now Philbin, who has made a variety of guest appearances on various shows over the last four years, once again has a permanent gig. Well, sort of. Reeg is set to make at least one special report per month. Gifford, Kotb and Philbin made the announcement today at a bar near the 'Today' set, where the ladies acted surprised to find Philbin behind the bar before the trio toasted the hiring with glasses of champagne. \"We are going to let everyone in on our secret,\" Gifford said to Kotb. \"We thought it would be the perfect person to join our motley crew, Regis Philbin,\" Kotb responded as the crowd cheered. \"Regis brings his legendary charm and humor each time he visits 'Today,' said Tammy Filler, the co-executive producer of the show in a statement. \"His energy is infectious, and when Regis is around, you never know what will happen.\" The new job will give the 83-year-old Philbin an opportunity to add to his famous tally. He owns the Guinness world record for most hours in front of a television camera. That said, it should be noted that this move is not just about reuniting two old friends. It's likely that NBC will tap Philbin to step in from time to time for Kotb, who has been spending more time filling in for other anchors during the show's earlier hours. The move adds some stability to a program that has seen some drama with other anchors over the last few years.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "EAST BREMERTON — The life of the old East High School gymnasium just got extended by a few more decades. The Legislature allocated $1 million in its capital budget to give the 1950s-era gym off Wheaton Way a new roof. Patches, or \"membranes,\" had been installed to keep the roof from leaking and damaging the hardwood inside, where generations of Bremerton teens from both the high school and later Bremerton Junior High School played. The announcement comes as the property, owned by the school district, is at a crossroads. A group dedicated to childhood health had hoped to develop a youth wellness campus there, and had embarked on an ambitious $18 million fundraising campaign to build out a seven-acre site. But the organization disbanded recently after funds could not be raised to demolish a dilapidated 125,000 square-foot portion of the former school. Still, former wellness campus executive director Patricia Hennessy said the money shows the wellness campus' work was worthwhile. \"We're keeping an iconic structure in the community alive for generations to come,\" said Hennessy, who noted the campus had already put about $250,000 in new lighting and other improvements into the gym complex. Aaron Leavell, Bremerton School District superintendent, said he was thankful to the Legislature and to Hennessy for continuing to work to get the funds despite the wellness campus' disbanding. \"I think it can revive some life back into that campus for future planning,\" he said. \"It may even spark future interest for possible development.\" The Bremerton Teen Center, including a Boys and Girls Club and low-cost dental clinic, continue to operate at the site. \"Having access to the gym enhances our programs and provides greater opportunity for teens to participate in sports and fitness programming at the Bremerton Teen Center,\" said Jinnie Horan, a spokeswoman for the Boys and Girls Clubs of South Puget Sound. And that wasn't all the money the former campus got. Lindquist Dental Center, which operates the dental clinic, received almost $400,000 to pay off their building debt there. Doing so \"will allow them to serve more kids,\" said state Sen. Christine Rolfes, who worked with Hennessy to find funding for the East Bremerton site. Because the wellness campus had dissolved, the money for the new gym roof will be administered by the Kitsap Community Foundation. \"Clearly, you can see the need to refurbish it,\" Rolfes said. \"Hopefully with this investment, it will provide 60 years of use to come.\" Mayor Patty Lent, too, was thrilled at the news. \"We're not giving up on possibilities for that space,\" she said, noting the loss of the wellness campus. \"It puts us in position to be a magnet for the next phase of development.\" Several other organizations also benefited from the wellness campus' disbanding and disbursement of remaining funds, Hennessy said. Sports Beyond, an organization run by local basketball coach Rick Walker, got $2,000 for a scorer's table at Bremerton High School, the Kitsap Fastpitch Association received $7,000 to upgrade fields on the former East High campus. Another $40,000 is going to the New Life Community Development Group, which is building the Marvin Williams Recreation Center in downtown Bremerton.",

    "LabBody": "Josh Allen’s muscle and hustle ignited the Evansville Otters in the bottom of the third as he and Nik Balog had Lake Erie seeing double on Friday night before at Bosse Field. Allen laced a two-run double to the right-center field gap and advanced to third on the ensuing error by Lake Erie center fielder Austin Prott in the third inning. Shortly thereafter, Allen stole home to increase the Otters’ lead to 3-0 as they went on to win, 8-2. He hit the first pitch off Lake Erie starter Hunter Adkins, a “fastball middle-away,” into the gap. “I knew he wanted to get ahead with the fastball and I kind of ambushed him,” said Allen, who had two hits, scored two runs and reached base four times. With left-handed hitting Dane Phillips at the plate, Lake Erie third baseman Anderson Hidalgo played way off the bag. On the previous pitch, Allen got a huge walking lead. He gave Evansville manager and third-base coach Andy McCauley a signal and McCauley grinned. “He said, ‘You got it?’ I said, ‘Yeah,’ ” Allen said. “He said, ‘Take it,’ and I did.” Allen stole home for the first time as a pro and the first time since playing for Bartow (Florida) High School. McCauley said it marked the first time an Otter had stolen home since Nick Schwaner on June 17, 2012. “Everything has got to be perfect,” McCauley said. “It’s kind of fun and it was rewarding. You’ve got to have it in this game. He was a kid who had kind of been beating himself up.” Evansville, which had four doubles, improved to 31-18. The Otters entered the game one-half game behind Traverse City and Southern Illinois in the Frontier League East Division. Chris Sweeney doubled off the third-base bag — literally — then scored on Balog’s two-run homer in the fourth as the Otters boosted their lead to 5-0. Balog hit a two-run double off the base of the right-field wall in the fifth, increasing the margin to 7-0. “He came up flush,” Allen said of Balog, who finished 3-for-4 with four runs batted in. Balog has driven in runs in seven of his last nine games and has nine RBIs in that span. Making his final start before the Frontier League All-Star break, Trevor Walch (6-3) allowed six hits in seven scoreless innings. Walch is one of five Otters named to the East All-Stars for the game Wednesday at Schaumburg, Illinois. He came in fourth in the league with a 1.77 earned-run average and lowered it to 1.59. “He did not have his best stuff,” McCauley said. “He gave up some hits but not any runs. He battled through his stuff.” Tyler Vail, who is 4-2 with a 4.08 ERA, is set to start for Evansville in the second of the three-game series at 6:35 p.m. Saturday.",

    "LabBody": "ALBUQUERQUE — New Mexico’s “three strikes” law is weak and doesn’t do enough to take violent criminals off the streets, Gov. Susana Martinez says. While promoting a new law that expands the state’s Amber Alerts to cellphones, the Republican governor said this week she’d like to see a tougher three strikes law in New Mexico and hopes lawmakers examine it next session. Martinez, a former prosecutor now in her fifth year as governor, said New Mexico’s three strikes law is so narrow that no inmate is currently serving a life sentence under it.",

The left is angry and filled with vitriol. It seeks happiness at the expense of others. The goal of the left is to demonize, scorn and attack anyone with a view that differs from theirs. In their arrogance and pride they even mock and attack God. The Supreme Court decision regarding marriage will not bring happiness to the gay community.

Nine’s new production executive, Stuart Clark, said: “We are thrilled to have Sam on board helping our six farmers on their quest for true love.

Tickets: In advance, $10 with Russ's Community Rewards card or $11 without at Russ's Markets; at the gate, $12; children ages 6 to 12 are $5 in advance or at the gate; admission free for children 5 and younger. Dancing was the star Thursday night when “42nd Street” opened at Pinewood Bowl. The cast of 43 grabbed the audience with the opening tap number. Director Courtney Piccoli hoped the production would showcase some of the talented tap dancers in Lincoln, and indeed it did. “42nd Street” tells the story of small-town talent Peggy Sawyer, played by Piccoli’s daughter Liza, trying to make it on Broadway. She gets her big break in a show directed by Julian Marsh, played by Robert Wamsley. Liza Piccoli and Wamsley delivered admirable vocal performances, and Piccoli’s vocals were only outdone by her dancing. Notable performances were also delivered by Jenna Richter-Nasif, making her Pinewood Bowl debut as Anytime Annie Reilly; Brittany Hying as Phyllis Dale; and Halsey Beull as Lorraine Fleming. Bailey West moved from the orchestra pit to the stage and delivered a strong portrayal of aging diva Dorothy Brock. Tim Wisgerhof created an intricate set rich with color and detail. Were those sowers topping the skyscrapers a subtle nod to Lincoln? The stage really came to life at dusk when the audience could fully appreciate the lighting design by John Hansen. The stunning costumes by Maralee Maldavs were showcased on the big dance numbers that stole the show. Though the level of vocal performance did not match the quality of the dancing, and the show lost a bit of pace and crispness after the lengthy intermission, the crowd enjoyed mild weather and an overall robust opening night performance. Courtney Piccoli was honored before the show as she celebrated her 10th anniversary of directing the annual Pinewood Bowl productions. At intermission, it was announced that next year the historic Lincoln venue will present “Seussical.” Copyright 2015 JournalStar.com. All rights reserved.

    "LabBody": "LAWRENCE — City narcotics detectives, working with local and federal authorities, seized about 15 pounds of heroin worth roughly $500,000, two firearms and $350,00 in cash during a drug sweep Thursday. Twenty-three people were arrested. A major arrest in the operation was a Manchester, N.H. man, Alexander Dume-Santana, 35, who was apprehended after an investigation that started on Willow Street, police said. Dume-Santana was driving a GMC Sierra pickup without a license, police said. After pulling him over at gunpoint, detectives found five individually wrapped kilos of cocaine on the front passenger seat of the truck, according to a police report. As a result of Dume-Santana's arrest, detectives then executed a search warrant at a nearby Allyn Terrace address. There, authorities seized two more kilos of heroin, two firearms and $350,000 cash, police said. Dume-Santana was arrested and charged with trafficking more than 20 grams of heroin, reckless operation, driving without a license, providing police with a false name and as a fugitive from justice. Dume-Santana has a outstanding New Hampshire warrant for sale of a controlled drug and two outstanding Massachusetts warrants, according to police records. Seven kilos of heroin weigh approximately 15 pounds. The large amount of heroin yields roughly $500,000 in illegal sales, police said. Dume-Santana initially gave detectives a false name of Nathaniel Diaz-Ramos, according to a report written by a Lawrence detective assigned to the city's Street Enforcement Narcotics Unit. Check back to eagletribune.com for more details on this story and a complete list of those arrested during Thursday's operation. Follow staff reporter Jill Harmacinski @EagleTribJill.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Type 2 diabetes may have consequences not only on the body, but on the brain as well. According to a new study, those with type 2 diabetes experienced negative changes in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, which was associated with lower scores on memory and cognition tests. \"Normal blood flow regulation allows the brain to redistribute blood to areas of the brain that have increased activity while performing certain tasks,\" said study author Dr. Vera Novak, of Harvard Medical School in Boston in a press release. \"People with type 2 diabetes have impaired blood flow regulation. Our results suggest that diabetes and high blood sugar impose a chronic negative effect on cognitive and decision-making skills.\" The study, published in Neurology, involved 40 people — 19 of which had type 2 diabetes and 21 that did not. The average age of participants was 66, and those with diabetes had been treated for an average of 13 years. The participants were tested at the beginning of the study and then two years later. In addition to the cognition tests, subjects underwent an MRI scan of the brain to observe blood flow and a blood test to measure control of blood sugar and inflammation. After two years, the participants with type 2 diabetes collectively had decreases in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain, down by about 65 percent. They also scored 12 percent lower on memory and cognition tests than they had two years ago, while those without diabetes scored the same. \"Early detection and monitoring of blood flow regulation may be an important predictor of accelerated changes in cognitive and decision-making skills,\" Novak said. She also added that additional studies with larger sample sets and a more extended follow-up time would be needed to better understand the relationship between blood flow regulation and changes in memory and thinking skills. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95 percent of diabetes cases in adults, and several studies have shown that regular physical activity and a healthy diet can prevent or delay the onset. Past studies have identified links between the condition and problems with blood flow in the brain, but the effect it has on cognition is only now being investigated.

    "LabBody": "No one can accuse of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie of not being straightforward — or entertaining, for that matter. Shortly after announcing his bid for the presidency Tuesday at his old high school in New Jersey, Christie and his family were on a plane headed to New Hampshire. The first official stop of Christie’s “Tell It Like It Is” campaign tour was Sandown Town Hall, where he introduced his wife, Mary Pat, and their four children. It was the beginning of a five-day tour that saw Christie travel throughout the Granite State and also to Maine, where he received the endorsement of Gov. Paul LePage. In Sandown, Mary Pat and children Andrew, Sarah, Patrick and Bridget were mentioned on occasion by their outspoken politican. So were Christie’s Irish father and his Sicilian mother, who he credited for making him an “expert at dispute resolution.” When Christie told the audience the country needed to abandon its agrarian-based calendar for a school year, he couldn’t help but point to his children sitting behind him. “Look at those four,” he said, “they aren’t going to till the fields, man.” When discussing the need for reforming the funding of higher education and affording the cost of college tuition, Mary Pat and Sarah suddenly took center stage. Poor Sarah was forced to listen to Dad talk about paying her tuition at the University of Notre Dame and how expensive it is — surely embarrassing for any college student. But that was only after Christie admitted his wife takes home a bigger paycheck than he does. “Do I what I did,” he said. “Marry a very successful woman.” Stumping in Salem. Like MaryAnn’s Diner in Derry, Tuscan Kitchen restaurant in Salem is quickly becoming a popular campaign stop for presidential hopefuls. GOP candidate and former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina will be speaking and greeting local supporters at owner Joe Faro’s popular Italian restaurant Wednesday at 11:45 a.m. The event, focusing on national issues and the challenges faced by businesses, is being hosted by Faro in conjunction with the Greater Salem Chamber of Commerce. But Fiorina isn’t the first to stop off at Tuscan Kitchen. Fellow Republicans Jeb Bush and Donald Trump made appearances there as well in the last few months. Bush also visited MaryAnn’s, known for years as the place where pancakes and politics stack up well. Christie received a key endorsement at MaryAnn’s on Friday. As for Trump, it was announced last week that his New Hampshire campaign would be co-chaired by Salem state representative Fred Doucette. Ayotte vs. Hassan? Speculation is increasing that N,H. Gov. Maggie Hassan will seek the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte announced last week she will run for another term and announced Thursday her campaign co-chairmen will be former Gov. Stephen Merrill and Salem’s own Donna Sytek. Merrill served as governor for two terms while Sytek spent more than 20 years in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, including four years as speaker. Sytek’s husband, John, currently serves in the House. When asked Wednesday if she planned to run for Ayotte’s seat, Hassan would not reveal her future plans to The Eagle-Tribune editorial board. “I’m just totally focused on fiscal 2015 and the budget, “ Hassan said of the well-publicized stalemate. “I’m focusing on my job as governor and getting the best possible budget for New Hampshire,” she said. Meanwhile, Republicans in the Legislature have attacked Hassan, saying she is more interested in seeking Ayotte’s seat than reaching a compromise on the proposed $11.3 billion state budget.

A couple visiting a local zoo was in for a treat. Terrified to go close to the animal, Yazhi the female puma, surprised the couple and her keepers as she burst into song. Yazhi seems to have found her voice to the amusement of the couple and everyone else surrounding. She goes on for several minutes playing with different ranges and scales. Yazhi is also not camera shy. As soon as her eyes met with the video camera, she continues her set. Pumas are cougars, also known as mountain lions or catamounts. They are mammals of the Felidae family. They can typically be found in western Canada and the United States all the way to Southern South America. There is a small subspecie population found in Florida according the San Diego Zoo. They have a typical lifespan of 20 years. Oh, and most are avid singers like Yazhi. Our songstress Yazhi, is housed at the Wildlife Heritage Foundation, and now that she has found her voice, she can sing all day long. Pumas like Yazhi usual vocalization includes hisses, bird-like sounds, and growls. They can even purr like cats, although females can make some scratchy hair-raising screams. Eartha Kitt don’t have anything on Yazhi. She performs to the amusement of the couple who video records the entire performance. Watch as Yazhi sings! Don’t forget to SHARE the love, and pass it on.

    "LabBody": "SALISBURY, N.C. — Someday, possibly in the very near future, Bruce Howard will call his 1,000th game as the Voice of the Golden Hurricane. Howard, director of Sports Broadcasting at the University of Tulsa since 1995 and TU’s play-by-play talent for football and men’s basketball since 1993, estimates that he has been on the mic for somewhere in the neighborhood of 930 games. Add in other sports and he’s “probably close” to 1,000. He’s also the 2014 Oklahoma Sportscaster of the Year as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, and on Monday night was honored as such with sportscasters and sportswriters from all 50 states and the District of Columbia at a black-tie awards gala at Catawba College. Howard also won the award in 2006. (Oklahoman columnist Berry Tramel was named Oklahoma sportswriter of the year. Tulsan Bob Carpenter, play-by-play voice of the Washington Nationals, was named D.C. sportscaster of the year.) Howard described how the broadcast industry has changed in the two decades he has been at TU. A greater online presence allows more sporting events to be live-streamed over the Internet, and an enhanced television package in partnership with the American Athletic Conference means more games on TV. Tulsa has better equipment and more efficient connections to keep up with the ever-evolving technology. But at TU, the greatest challenge hasn’t changed: manpower. “We just don’t have that many students,” Howard said. But that hasn’t slowed the explosive growth of athletic facilities on the TU campus during Howard’s tenure. “It started with (former president) Bob Lawless and (former athletic director) Judy MacLeod and the Reynolds Center,” Howard said. “When I first started broadcasting in 1993, we had an aging football stadium, no basketball arena, an intramural tennis facility at best, no place for soccer to play, no place for softball to play, no track and field — I mean, think about that. We had basically one home venue. And then you get the Reynolds Center, then the Case Tennis Center, the softball stadium was built, the soccer and track stadium, just the recreational facility over there. So that growth has been incredible.” The Reynolds Center in 1998, the addition of the Case Athletic Complex in 2007 and the Chapman Stadium/Skelly Field renovation in 2008 changed the game for TU athletics. “A sign of a university that’s forward thinking is to constantly look forward to that next thing,” Howard said. “What they do, as the smallest (enrollment) football institution in Division I, it’s remarkable.” Up next — possibly soon — is an indoor football practice facility that also will serve the student body. And new Golden Hurricane coaches like Philip Montgomery and Frank Haith are reaping the rewards. TU’s first basketball season under Haith, formerly head coach at Miami and Missouri, resulted in a 23-11 record, a second-place finish in TU’s first season in The American and a berth in the NIT. Montgomery, previously offensive coordinator at record-setting Baylor, hasn’t coached a football game yet but already has fans squirming over his vision of fast-paced, high-scoring offense. “I think Philip Montgomery’s come in and done just great work,” Howard said. “He’s got a lot of energy, and I think a lot of folks are just excited about the prospect of up-tempo football — kind of getting back maybe to what we saw a few years back when the team was setting records and that sort of thing. A lot of folks are excited about it. I know I’m excited about it.” Howard likes Montgomery’s straight-shooter persona. He recalls sitting with a friend during a women’s basketball game who, it turned out, was an old acquaintance of Montgomery. When Montgomery walked past on his way to a meet-and-greet with TU boosters, he stopped, sat down and visited for the entire second half. “That, to me, is an indication of what kind of guy he is,” Howard said. “Like, ‘No, I don’t need to be with the boosters or the big-wigs or whatever.’ ” Howard got a similar read after spending a year getting to know Haith. “Frank is a good guy to work with, easy to work with,” Howard said. “Media-savvy. And, I think, very underrated as a bench coach. I don’t think people give him enough credit for being a good bench coach. He knows what’s going on.” Howard said TU’s 12-game winning streak and 10-0 start to conference play is good evidence of Haith’s coaching skills. “I think they did a remarkable job of taking what was there and adding to it,” Howard said, “… of coaching them up and getting them — in a much more difficult conference — to where they were essentially one victory away from securing a regular-season crown, and then most likely an NCAA bid, who knows. “The joke was, for a team that can’t shoot and isn’t very tall, hey, we won 23 games. They did a good job overcoming their flaws.” Editor’s note: Tulsa World sports columnist John E. Hoover this weekend was in North Carolina, where he was presented the 2014 Excellence in Sports Medicine Reporting Award from the National Athletic Trainers Association.",

Midland police officers were dispatched to a residence off North Terrell Street in reference to a disturbance. Upon arrival, officers were advised by the alleged victim that a verbal argument between her and Benavidez had escalated to the point where Benavidez threw several items around the house, pushed her to the ground and began slamming her head to the ground, according to Benavidez’s arrest affidavit. Benavidez left the residence before officers arrived but was later apprehended walking along East Golf Course Road. He told officers that he engaged in the argument because “she doesn’t want to work,” according to his affidavit, however Benavidez denies ever physically assaulting her. If convicted of the third-degree felony, Benavidez could face up to 10 years in prison.",

    "LabBody": "McKinney Police Chief Greg Conley called the actions of a police officer who’s been at the center of international attention because of his response to a weekend pool party as “indefensible” following that officer’s resignation Tuesday. Former McKinney Police Cpl. Eric Casebolt resigned earlier Tuesday amid an internal investigation into what transpired at a party Friday at a community pool in Craig Ranch on McKinney’s west side. A video that went viral after the party shows Casebolt throw a teenage girl to the ground before pulling his gun on two other party attendees. Conley, who took over as chief about six weeks ago, singled out Casebolt as the lone officer who acted in an errant manner in response to the party. “He came into the call out of control and as the video shows was out of control during the incident,” Conley said at a press conference Tuesday evening. “I had 12 officers on scene and 11 of them performed according to their training. They did an excellent job.” The entire community, and many around the state, nation and world, reacted to Friday’s events in recent days, some condemning Casebolt’s actions and others backing his ability to control the situation. Conley reemphasized that police were called to the party because of a “fight in progress and general disturbance.” Residents of the neighborhood said party attendees were also trespassing at the pool and climbing fences to access the party. “I do not condone the actions of those individuals who violated the rules of the community, showed disrespect to the security person on scene and to the officers who responded,” Conley said. “However, we as a department are held to a high standard of action as we do our jobs.” Because Casebolt is no longer a member of McKinney PD, the internal investigation is over, Conley said. He resigned while under investigation. The department will continue looking into whether there will be criminal charges against anyone involved, Conley added, but said it “will take a matter of time for us to work through all those allegations and those people who have come forward to us to complain.” Adrian Martin, a teenager who appeared to come to the aid of the girl who Casebolt swung to the ground in the video, was charged with interfering with police duties and evading arrest. Those charges have been dropped, Conley said. Mayor Brian Loughmiller, who also spoke with reporters Tuesday, said, “I don’t think that any one incident, any one individual, can totally define the community as a whole now or for the next year or for the next 10 years.” La’Shadion Anthony, a resident at Tuesday’s press conference who said he’s good friends with the father of Dajerria Becton, the 15-year-old taken down by Casebolt, asked the mayor whether those who wear a badge are above the law. “I do believe that we should hold our staff and our employees accountable,” Loughmiller responded. “And we do that.” Anthony said Casebolt’s resignation is “a victory for the city that we don’t have this guy on our streets anymore” and that he feels “safer already for our children.” “This is a great first step,” Anthony said. “But we still have a ways to go, because we still want charges pressed for the assault of a minor.” When asked if the incident would lead to any tweaks in department training, Conley said “we are always evaluating our training” and reiterated that 11 of the 12 officers on scene “did exactly what we would want them to do.” Moving forward and continuing to learn from the recent incident is what’s important now, according to Loughmiller. “There has to be an expectation and training in how you relate to police officers, as well, as an individual,” he said. “We’re going to work through all of that and try to … get past this and make our community stronger.”",

    "LabBody": "With all the furor over the Confederate flag, lately I've found the \"Dukes of Hazzard\" theme song rolling around in my head. Just the good ol' boys. Never meanin' no harm. Beats all you ever saw, been in trouble with the law. Since the day they was born. Of course, it doesn't take much to get a song stuck in my head. TV themes, ad jingles, nursery rhymes I learned as a preschooler; my brain has devoted valuable storage space to every one of them. It's as if, just before the spirit that was to become Me took its first Holy Elevator Ride down to this planet, God asked whether I would prefer to be able to remember song lyrics or people's names and faces, and I said, \"Song lyrics, heck yeah! Give me the 'Scooby Doo' theme over recognizing my husband's longtime coworkers at the grocery store any day.\" I swear, on my deathbed I will not recognize my own children, but I'll be able to sing the 1980s commercial about the ice-cold milk and the Oreo cookie. When a dark, delicious cookie hits an icy-cold sensation like the one and only creamy-center chocolate O-R-E-O ... Anyway. So I was thinking about them Duke boys right about the time Husband came home for lunch and noted that he'd seen a house with a flagpole and the Stars and Bars flying, high and proud. I mentioned I had seen a Washington Post article reminding readers that the flag was first raised over the capitol of South Carolina in 1962 as a visual \"Bleep You\" to the Civil Rights movement, and wondered aloud if the folks with the flag knew that. However, I said, I had been thinking about the Dukes (\"Makin' their wayyyy — the only way they know how/That's just a little bit more than the law will allow\") and I was pretty sure that most people around here connect the Confederate flag with that spirit, rather than the one that feels opening fire in a church full of worshipers is an acceptable statement on multiracial living. In a way, I understand. We all like to root for the underdog. We all like to see the Man get his comeuppance. We all like to think that were we in Hazzard County, we would be the ones gleefully distracting Roscoe P. Coltrane in order to help Bo and Luke pull a fast one on Boss Hogg (and then maybe catch a ride with them in the General Lee as they blasted out of town). In some ways and to some people who have never been in a position to know differently, it's that rebel spirit the Confederate flag represents — not a desire to exclude, oppress or outright slaughter people whose skin is a different shade. So I do understand. But as long as that deeper meaning exists too, I can't agree. However, I do want to suggest an alternative. I have the perfect flag in mind for someone who wants to say, \"You can't keep me down,\" or, \"No other country owns me,\" or even just, \"Hey! I hold some truths to be self evident, here.\" It's our own Stars and Stripes, the one that thumbs its nose at England by its very existence. Ultimate Rebel flag, folks, still going strong. Just the good ol' boys. Wouldn't change if they could. Fightin' the system. Like a true modern-day Robin Hood. Something to think about as we move toward Independence Day.

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "After dispensing with Maria Sharapova in the semi-final with the absent-minded effort you might employ in popping bubblewrap, the real game started for Serena Williams in her press conference on Friday. The rules are as follows: using all manner of linguistic ambushes, journalists attempt to ask about the significance of the Serena Slam; Williams, with weary resignation, bats them away. “I don’t want the pressure of that, and I’m not thinking of that. When you talk about it every time, you can’t help but think about it. It’s been OK just to free my brain from that.” Refusing to acknowledge it, however, does not make it any less real. History, as well as Garbine Muguruza, will be standing on the opposite side of the net on Centre Court on Saturday. As champion of the US, Australian and French Opens, Williams is one victory away from holding the set simultaneously, as she did in 2003, as well as completing the third leg of a calendar slam. Garbine Muguruza will be playing in her first grand slam final Rarely has a grand slam final thrown up such a disparity in experience. Muguruza, the 21-year-old from Barcelona, only recently entered the top 20; Williams has been world No 1 for 124 consecutive weeks. Muguruza has one title to her name (Hobart in 2014); Williams has 67. Muguruza has never previously progressed this far at a slam; Williams will be playing for her 21st grand slam title, one short of Steffi Graf’s record, 16 years after the first at Flushing Meadows. In the intervening period, Williams’s burning desire for victory in climbing the mountain was replaced by a pathological fear of defeat, of losing her place at the top of the rung rather than a fixation in passing a particular milestone. “I don’t think it’s got easier,” Williams said. “I just think I don’t feel as desperate to win. I think it helps me be relaxed. I was so desperate to get to 18, and ever since then, I’ve been totally relaxed. I’ve won so many grand slam titles. I don’t need to win another Wimbledon. I could lose tomorrow. Serena Williams goes into the final as the heavy favourite “I really hate losing. So I’m that kind of person that will work hard, work harder than anybody else to make sure I don’t get that. If I do, I learn from it better. That way I don’t have to do it in a long time.” It is that attitude that has elevated the 33-year-old to a pantheon of her own making in a sport in which most of her contemporaries have long since retired. “It’s strange because a lot of the people I grew up with are now on the legends tour. It’s like, ‘should I play legends as well as the main?’ ” Williams was very keen to remind everyone that she has lost to Muguruza, at the 2014 French Open, which she believes inspired an about-turn in her fortunes. “It was an eye-opening loss for me,” Williams said. “Some losses you’re angry about, and some losses you learn from. That loss I think I learnt the most from in a long time. I got so much better after that loss. Months later I started seeing the results more and more. “I don’t think she’s intimidated at all. She’s not that kind of person.” The Spaniard with the million-dollar smile accepts she must puncture the Williams aura if she is to put a spoke in the wheels of history. “Beating her is really important because it makes you see and realise that she’s also a person, she also has feelings, she is also nervous. To her, she knows that I can win against her, that I’m not afraid. I don’t think she’s really used to this. It’s true that it’s a very difficult match, but I think I have to believe I can do it.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "COLUMBIA — Marquavius Lewis isn’t much of a talker. He doesn’t need to be. The statistics he brings from junior college do much of that for him. Those numbers are difficult to ignore, given how they clash with the totals posted last season at South Carolina, which suffered through one of its worst defensive campaigns on record. The Gamecocks as a team managed just 14 sacks in 2014, last in the SEC. USC’s sack leaders, Gerald Dixon and Jordan Diggs, tallied just two each in a year when maintaining pressure on the opposing quarterback emerged as one of the Gamecocks’ biggest headaches of the fall. Enter Lewis, a Greenwood native who last year was among the nation’s top defensive prospects out of junior college. The Jayhawk Conference Defensive Player of the Year finished with 11 sacks on his own, part of a season where he logged 63 tackles, 20.5 of those for a loss. Yes, they were tallied at Hutchinson Community College, which at last check isn’t in the SEC. But the 6-3, 265-pound Lewis was still so prized at USC that he was plugged in as a starting defensive end before he had even taken a snap in spring practice. “I felt like this is where I was needed,” Lewis, who chose USC over Auburn, said in the spring, “and that’s why I chose to come here.” In time since, he’s only solidified his position. Coaches and teammates alike have raved about Lewis’ quiet work ethic, about his lack of an ego, about how a player so sought after could immediately blend into a group. He won USC’s Defensive Player of the Spring award. Barring some shocking unforeseen development, big No. 8 will start at one defensive end against North Carolina on Sept. 3. “He’s very quiet,” said co-defensive coordinator Jon Hoke. “He just kind of goes to work, he works very well, so those are all great things to see in a guy.” Lewis is but one part of a defensive overhaul at USC that also includes the addition of Hoke, the installation of a 4-3 defense, a handful of player position changes and the influx of a number of new candidates along the Gamecocks’ defensive line. But Lewis — call him Quay — is the cornerstone of it all, a pass rusher unlike any South Carolina had last season, that missing piece which could separate a struggling defense from a competitive one. The debacle against Clemson aside, USC showed signs late last season that it might not be that far away from becoming the latter. Lewis could provide the Gamecocks with a healthy shove in that direction if he emerges as anything close to the pass rusher he was in junior college. He wants double-digit sacks. To have the impact USC coaches believe he’s capable of, he may not need that many. USC Top 10.

    "LabBody": "When the Tragically Hip recorded their landmark 1992 album, Fully Completely, the music industry was a different world. Back in the glory days of CD sales, recording budgets allowed worthy bands to fly to internationally renowned hotspots, stay for weeks at a time and work with a world-class producer. For the Hip, after making albums in Memphis and New Orleans, recording their third full-length in London with Chris Tsangarides had the makings of a “grand experience,” recalled Hip guitarist Rob Baker. Off to England went Baker and his bandmates: singer Gord Downie, guitarist Paul Langlois, bassist Gord Sinclair and drummer Johnny Fay. It turned out to be a “pretty horrible place,” Baker added with a chuckle. “There were some definite good things about it, but it was cold and rainy and we were in the studio twelve hours a day. We’d get out of the studio but there isn’t a lot to do late at night unless you really know where to go and have transport. So we’d go back to our little flat that we were all sharing and we’d play Scrabble and drink port and watch Olympic highlights.” Fortunately, they made a terrific album, at a time when the industry could support the extravagance of an out-of-country recording experience. That doesn’t happen much anymore. “The industry has changed so much that a band that gets lucky might get $30,000 to make their record, and for that, they give up publishing, some live income, revenue from merchandise. They give up a lot,” said Baker. “That was our art budget for Fully Completely. We spent $30,000 doing the cover.” In those days, he explained, major-label bands like the Hip would get a budget of about $150,000 to make a record. If it broke even, the budget went up a bit for the next one. By Fully Completely, Baker estimates the budget would have been more than $185,000. The numbers would grow for another decade. “Our album budgets were rising into the $300,000 level at the same time the bottom started to drop out of album sales,” Baker said, pinpointing the 2002 album In Violet Light as the moment the balance tipped. “You know, I’d like to think it had something to do with the business imploding rather than us getting really s***ty but it’s probably a combination.” Fans can debate that one, but everyone agrees they were the hottest band in the country in the early 1990s. When the five Kingston lads flew to London, they were road warriors, logging up to 200 shows per year. Tsangarides buffed their raw energy with a studio polish that sent the album to the top of the Canadian charts. There were no fewer than six singles: Locked in the Trunk of a Car, Fifty Mission Cap, Courage (For Hugh MacLennan), At the Hundredth Meridian, Looking for a Place to Happen and the title track. The band celebrated the release of Fully Completely with a deluxe edition of the album, and have spent most of 2015 revisiting the music on tour. It’s made for a surprisingly intense show, reports Baker.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Storied L.A. rapper and producer DJ Quik creates detailed, sometimes fussy, and often eccentric music that manages to retain an acute pop sensibility and, more importantly, an incorruptible smoothness—call him hip-hop’s Todd Rundgren. On this year’s The Midnight Life, Quik built beats around banjo licks and train noises that threatened to out-funk his former collaborator Dre, and \"Pet Sematary\" was a perfect lead single. Its ornate but in-the-pocket production is as silky and flawlessly orchestrated a track as Quik has made since the late '90s, and it boasted one of the best lead-off lines for a rap verse this year: \"Now what they want to go cancel Arsenio Hall for?/ Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for.\" Hall’s talk show rose to prominence in the early '90s, around the same time that Quik was finding commercial success, and he appeared on \"Arsenio\" a few times both to rap and DJ; last year—on a newly resurrected version of the show—the rapper announced the release of The Midnight Life. In a song that mostly celebrates living in the present—more focused on the narrative of maintaining than reclaiming glory—the nostalgic line feels poignant; like second-time-loser Arsenio, the perpetually \"most underrated\" Quik has been declared down for the count more than once, and may now be winding down himself. But as in the case of most of Quik’s work, the complaint is just a point in the rapper’s tangled constellation of talking points (mainly, taunts and come-ons to adversaries, fair-weather fans, and the female population of South Central at large), which are as full of ingenious contradictions as his beats. —Winston Cook-Wilson DJ Quik: \"Pet Sematary\" There was a time when the killing in a Lauryn Hill song was done softly and figuratively, through the power of music. That time was long ago. In the late 1990s, a false rumor about the singer/songwriter who would become perhaps rap's most gifted recluse supposedly saying she'd rather die than have white people buying her albums spread so widely there's a Snopes.com page dedicated to debunking it. Over the years since the former Fugees member's sole solo studio album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as she has drifted in and out of the public eye, her self-aggrandizing statements and unfortunate habit of showing up late for live shows have continued to divide, in ways that still say more about the culture than about her. When Hill went to prison to serve a three-month sentence for tax evasion in 2013, she opened herself to further miscomprehension by discussing her conviction in terms of slavery, colonialism, and institutionalized racism. It might not have played well in Peoria, but she was bringing up a legacy America has yet to escape, in ways that became tragically obvious this year. In the same pre-prison pronouncement, Hill said, \"You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\" In 2012, she had premiered a spoken-word piece titled \"Black Rage\", which turned the lyrical framework of Rodgers \u0026 Hammerstein's \"My Favorite Things\" into a prolix litany of the crimes that one group of people have perpetrated against another, and a stinging endorsement of anger as an antidote to fear; in later live versions the interpolation became, like John Coltrane's classic cover, a musical one, as well. When the artist, now known professionally as Ms. Lauryn Hill, shared \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" in late August, with a call for peace in Missouri, the times had caught up with her song. She once told an interviewer, \"If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children,\" and this sketch, recorded in her living room, benefits by couching its broad social themes in family-like intimacy; her kids' voices can be heard behind her deepening, huskier roar, along with acoustic guitar and a murmuring rhythm. Some will share Hill's fury, some won't, but her unexpurgated message of focused resilience points toward part of what has been missing all along: A mutual understanding. To promote a new pay-for-view concert video, Hill recently shared a clip of herself performing the Fugees' \"Ready or Not\" live in Brooklyn. In the song, as on the original, she raps, \"While you're imitating Al Capone/ I'll be Nina Simone.\" Simone, the subject of a controversial upcoming biopic, prefigured aspects of Hill's career trajectory in her own evolution toward racial confrontation. Simone reportedly warned Martin Luther King Jr., on meeting him, that she wasn't nonviolent. \"Not to worry, sister,\" King responded; she even later insisted upon being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" You'd never guess it by the ongoing rounds of backlash against Hill, which prompted Talib Kweli to write an essay defending her this year, but this mere Ms. has yet to go as far in her radicalism as the late legend, who, singing the then-new \"Mississippi Goddam\" at Carnegie Hall in 1964, blithely informed a mostly white audience, \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies/ You're all gonna die and die like flies.\" But \"Black Rage (Sketch)\" belongs to that tradition, one of righteous indignation in the face of injustice, speaking to the persecuted wherever they may be, whatever they might look like. And it shows that, for all the actual death and cruelty in the headlines, the sound of music can still be quietly devastating. —Marc Hogan The other side of \"Chorus\", a 12'' single issued at the start of the year by the globally minded electronic producer Holly Herndon, sounds like an audition tape for the relatively esoteric sound-art label Editions Mego. During \"Solo Voice\", slivers and snapshots of her voice twist into pointillist spires—chirpy and more musical than the most recent experiments of clear inspiration Florian Hecker, but only by degrees. Even Herndon’s most kinetic work has always seemed as driven by ideas as approachability, and \"Solo Voice\" is an unabashed expression of the former. Could a disembodied and dissected human voice be built into something new with computers? \"Chorus\" explores a similar line of inquiry. Herndon splits her simple, fetching melody into bits, so that her words seem sung by a cyborg programmed with a speech impediment. Syllables end abruptly, stand alone, and stretch over open space. But Herndon twists those samples of herself around beats that sometimes boom and burst like dubstep and sometimes stutter and sprint like IDM. In the space between the two, Herndon laces a panoply of fragments gathered piecemeal as she browsed online. The result, vividly illustrated in a subsequent video collaboration with Japanese artist Akihiko Taniguchi, blurs the relationship between web and browser, machine and user, data and devourer. Herndon becomes the principal input in a system bigger than herself, and she tries to be altered without being absorbed. It’s a canny reflection on our digital lives, rendered with a physicality that pulls it back into our own mainframe. —Grayson Haver Currin \"I Am Not Afraid\", the track that kicks off the gorgeous In Conflict, is as much a riddle as it is a song. Those who may have arrived at Owen Pallett’s music by way of his theoretical explications of pop tracks wouldn’t have been surprised at the obvious intelligence of the writing here, or the foreboding and beauty of the music behind it. It would have been more discomfiting to reckon with the intense strangeness of lyrics that seem several worlds away from the crush-love-heartbreak-repeat cycle of the pop music Pallett clearly understands so well. Pallett has said that In Conflict is the first of his records on which he tried to write lyrics that were both non-allegorical and autobiographical. But even if the material \"I Am Not Afraid\" draws upon comes from Pallett’s own life, the song is extraordinarily rich in imagery and metaphor, whether it’s Pallett leaving his \"violin unattended in a cab or restaurant\" or sharing lyrics like \"They told me to chew on a toothpick/ They told me to take a deep breath.\" These are depictions of anxiety and anger—heady emotions clashing with the record’s central message that its subject is not afraid and salvation may be found in discipline. So while there’s clearly that eponymous conflict in effect here, the idea motivating the song remains fleeting. The music of \"I Am Not Afraid\" is mostly gorgeous as it transitions from violin to piano and back, but it is also strange, and sometimes frightening (a result of Pallett dropping what he calls \"black notes\"—i.e., the exact wrong note for the melody—into the mix). Accepting the discomfort of the very music here, and accepting the discomfort of the lyrics, becomes both a metaphor and a microcosm of the experience that those born into any of the groups that hold dominion (whites, males, cisgenders) must undertake to reckon with their unearned status. To draw on what Pallett has said directly, this musical and lyrical confusion also functions as a metaphor for his own \"displacement and dysphoria.\" By taking the political and rendering it both personal and deliberately inscrutable, Pallett has managed to confound in the best way possible and create a relatable pop experience for voices that are too often ignored. —Jonah Bromwich It’s been an art from blues to Britney: the song as extended double entendre, one that can come off either unassailably clean or unspeakably filthy depending on the listener’s life experience and cleanliness of mind (or nearness to a Google searchbox). \"Love Me Harder\" is sort of the opposite: even when it’s clean it sounds teasingly off, and even when it’s dirty, it sounds so disarmingly spit-shine clean. Much of it’s the premise: pairing a singer who was a babysitter on Nickelodeon less than half a year ago with a singer whose discography contains endless variations on permanently corrupting young ingenues, with no apologies and no inclinations to change that. Even more of it’s the execution: organ peals timed like winks after each line; Grande switching emotional beats like poses, her voice either knowing beyond her years or just polished to sound like it, with no indication as to which; Tesfaye revisiting the sturdy nocturnal electro-house of his Kavinsky collaboration (a sound that’s been fast adopted by the pop trickbook, from megastars to newcomers), leering about his rep and finding a way to describe hardcore porn acts in PG terms. When these tracks fail, they’re the most embarrassing failures an artist can have; when they succeed, the sleight of song can be breathtaking. Here’s to a generation of kids realizing horrifying things in 2020 about their teenage jam—and what lodged it in their mind. —Katherine St. Asaph Ariana Grande: \"Love Me Harder\" [ft. The Weeknd] Tobias Jesso Jr. isn't the first guy to have his heart squashed by Los Angeles. After failing to make it as a pop songwriter, breaking up with his girlfriend, getting hit by a car, and—icing on the cake—moving to to Vancouver to help care for his ailing mother, balloons fell from the ceiling as Jesso became the world's one billionth failed songwriter. So he dusted off his sister's old piano, wrote a few heart-stricken ballads, and posted them to Youtube. What happened next was unlikely: An email to Chet \"JR\" White (whose band Girls had just broken up) led to a True Panther signing and bam—Jesso's back on his feet, with a debut tiled Goon slated for next year. His breakthrough track, \"True Love\", is perhaps an even less likely success. About as bald-faced and hopelessly romantic as music in 2014 comes, Jesso calls on the spirits of the underdog singer-songwriters of the '70s (think Randy Newman circa Good Old Boys), nicks the melody from Nelly's \"Dilemma\" almost wholesale, and delivers one of the best lump-in-your throat choruses of the year. Which isn't to mention that it sounds like a half-tempo version of the saddest '80s sitcom theme song ever recorded. But there's something so worn and natural about it, it's hard to think of it as anything but the purest declaration of the heart. Call up the YouTube video for \"True Love\", and you'll find a family photograph of Jesso at maybe seven or eight-years-old, looking up at the camera with his fingers poking at a cheap Casio keyboard. It's hard not to believe the kid would make it after all. —Zach Kelly Tobias Jesso Jr.: \"True Love\" Beyoncé hasn’t been a traditional singles artist for years—4, her 2011 opus, didn’t even put anything in the top 10. And when you Beyoncé not only an album into the world but over a dozen songs with prime-time-ready videos, the formula’s bound to be shaken even further. The obvious industry singles—Ryan Tedder collab \"XO\", erstwhile Katy Perry song \"Pretty Hurts\", whatever “Standing on the Sun” was supposed to be in the months Before Knowles—floundered; even \"Drunk in Love\", a bona fide hit that rode the pomp and TV performance circuit to No. 2, seemed more like a populist underdog fighting chart trends than a preordained smash. Yet there were alternatives: 14 songs, all different, yet each personality-packed, like a personality quiz without any of the data-mining malaise—except the sort that produces people’s-choice singles. And the people’s choice, it turns out, was \"Partition\". If Beyoncé-the-statement was reducible to a single track, this would be it. Jay-Z asserts his presence without actually commandeering the track to rap about breastses and breakfast. Beyoncé thoroughly enjoys her reverie, fetishizing their own celebrity because who else gets to do it? And the track balances no-nonsense hitmaking—the hook’s her most traditionally urban radio-ready since B’Day, the beat roaring from simmer to insatiable and back within seconds—and nonchalant trolling. If you think \"Partition\" is a load of oversharing in a cab seat, Beyoncé is mocking you via a French Big Lebowski lecture. If you think \"Partition\" is a big cameras-flashing FEMINIST TRIUMPH, Beyoncé will make you frame that around a goofy Big Lebowski quote, knowing you’ll share it on all platforms anyway. It’s provocative, let’s say; it gets the people going. —Katherine St. Asaph It wasn’t so long ago that being a Young Thug fan felt like you were in on rap’s most rewarding secret. Revelling in the unpredictability of his I Came From Nothing mixtape series, I can honestly admit that, no, I didn’t see his success coming: even at his poppiest, Thug felt way too weird to transcend cult status. Even on his breakthrough release, 2013’s 1017 Thug, the bits that rose to the top were highly tweetable but barely marketable; keep in mind, this was still pre-\"Versace\", a song that would be used as a punchline by \"serious\" rap fans as often as it would be celebrated later that year. That feels like ages ago. Thug closes 2014 as, if not quite a household name, an unavoidable presence in the rap landscape. A short list of stars who co-opted his once-singular swag this year includes Nicki Minaj, T.I., Gucci Mane, and Lil Wayne (his closest spiritual progenitor, who at this point feels prudish in relation), not to mention the dozens of impressionable ATLiens who’ve practically made his yelps and chirps into its own subgenre. It isn’t that Thug’s succeeded in spite of his quirks: they’ve become the hook. The odder he gets, the more people respond, his endless idiosyncrasies feeding the insatiable demand for clicks that’s come to reshape online media. Such a near-sighted focus on the \"weirdness\" sells Thug short. Of his three major singles this year, each highlighted a distinct facet of his skill set. \"Danny Glover\" was peak zaniness, probing the outer limits of what constitutes catchiness; \"The Blanguage\", in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin, presented Thug as a deft lyricist and effective balladeer. But best of all was \"Stoner\", in which words fell short as descriptors and functioned instead as measurements of rhythm and space. If anything, it made more sense as a grime song than a rap song, with Dun Deal’s spare beat challenging Thug to find new ways to make himself comfortable within it. It struck a precarious balance between restraint and release: an unsure hand could've sent the whole thing toppling. It wasn’t weird—it was masterful. —Meaghan Garvey Young Thug: \"Stoner\" There are qualities about Mike Hadreas that make him seem heroic: His songbook takes on themes of trauma and addiction, the body and identity, all in a way that seems designed to protect us—a reminder that we're not alone in our otherness. This year, Hadreas has been selling T-shirts depicting an emasculated Eminem, a proper jab at one of popular music's most problematic living artists. On the shirt, Slim is clad in coral lipstick, just a few shades lighter than the tint Hadreas wore on his watershed \"Letterman\" performance in October, contorting a slow, sultry sway through \"Queen\". Indeed, Hadreas' work as Perfume Genius has opened a crucial dialogue over the past half decade. Recall the 2012 incident with his 16-second YouTube ad for Put Your Back N 2 It getting censored for \"promoting mature sexual themes\" because it featured two shirtless men hugging. As there's no shortage of topless folks on YouTube, the message from Google was clear: it was the queerness that was unsuitable and—as the corporation wrote in a statement—\"not family safe.\" And so, should you need convincing, the quaking \"Queen\" is empirically necessary. \"No family is safe/ When I sashay,\" Hadreas asserts through expressive breaths on the refrain of the year, channeling personal rage into a surreal energy, addressing gay panic—the idea that one's visible otherness as a gay individual makes people uncomfortable, that it’s perceived as a threat to the straight world. Hadreas sounds just as defiant and poetic in 2014 as Patti Smith did in 1975 telling us how Jesus did not die for her sins. And like Smith's earth-shattering subversions of the female archetype, Hadreas' provocations are confident, uncompromising, epic—he appoints himself \"queen\" and owns the supposed flaws of his sexuality (\"cracked, peeling, riddled with disease\") with a deviant wink and demonic smirk. One would expect music that is both radically politicized and universal from someone who grew up listening to \"a lot of badass feminist music\" and who says he's seen Sleater-Kinney at least 13 times. His words alone have such inspired power—imagine them publicly broadcast on a marquee in LED lighting, like a Jenny Holzer installation—but \"Queen\" does not just illuminate the potential of explicit language. It has few aesthetic precedents, though it pushes the borders of pop and avant-gardism in a way Arthur Russell would have appreciated. The cool drag of a drum contribution from PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish morphed the song into what has been aptly described in interviews as \"stoner glam.\" There is a tornado swirling—a deep, booming low-end; abrasive synths rolling into an ecstatic dreamscape; passing clouds made of soul—and Hadreas is at the eye of the storm, a light steadily beaming from the chaos of the world, stepping into the future. \"Queen\" is a gay anthem, but it also empathizes broadly with all people who biologically have less direct access to the top seats in society. In a year that rendered the world's rampant, widespread injustice so depressingly apparent, what could keep us believing that all this music stuff matters so much? It's songs like \"Queen\" and the sea changes they summon that give it purpose. The future of pop belongs to people like Hadreas, who will take us forward to new places we didn't know we needed to go. Surrounded by this loud, extreme music, it sounds like nothing can hurt him now. —Jenn Pelly Perfume Genius: \"Queen\"",
    "LabBody": "In one of 2014’s quietest revelations, Gainesville quartet Hundred Waters transcended one of pop music’s most shopworn clichés. An upstart group emerged from nowhere in 2012 with a polished, wholly unique debut record, is subsequently chased by every noteworthy major-indie, chooses instead to take Skrillex’s money…and succeeds on all counts. The Moon Rang Like a Bell expands on the promise of their debut album without sacrificing anything about what made it good. They upgrade their IDM faerie-queene origins to the oddball electro/R\u0026B mainstage of FKA twigs, Purity Ring, and How to Dress Well, in other words, but on \"Murmurs\", singer/songwriter Nicole Miglis still manages to sneak in the word \"thee.\" The group sets \"Murmurs\" in the kind of ice palace pioneered by the Cocteau Twins or Homogenic, but Miglis pitches her voice to a pained upper register that Björk or Elisabeth Fraser never went. It’s a breakup song themed around a missed birthday—images of candles and wishes abound—but the production’s combination of churchly solemnity and far-off, slow-motion industrial clamor suggest something much more universal: the consistent drone of modern life co-existing with timeless cycles of loss and rebirth. Above all, though, is the song's devotion to \"thee,\" that constant, all-too-human desire to view experience through someone else’s eyes. —Eric Harvey. Hundred Waters: \"Murmurs\" (via SoundCloud)",

    "LabBody": "A dysfunctional love story between America and a battered working class, Delta Rae’s latest album, “After It All” is their view of the country post-recession. After working on the project for a year and a half, the six member folk-pop band released it as their second full-length album on April 7. They are now touring, making a stop in North Texas to perform at a show that begins at 8 p.m. on July 16 at Kessler Theater, 1230 W. Davis St., Dallas. Brittany Hölljes, percussionist and singer, feels that the band’s first full-length album, “Carry the Fire,” is the little seed for what the album, “After It All,” became. On the surface, their career at this point is a bit ironic. Through the duration of the production of their latest album, they’ve been living the American dream while writing songs about the disparities of life among the working class. But, their path to find normalcy in making music for a living was paved with 16-hour workdays and multiple jobs. Elizabeth Hopkins, vocalist and percussionist, had four part-time jobs when the band found out they had gotten a record deal with Warner Bros.: answering phones at a theater, acting as a teacher’s assistant at a preschool, tutoring Spanish and babysitting. “Sometimes I would have one hour between one job to the next, but I guess we did what we had to do,” Hopkins said. At the time, she and a few of the band members were living in a house in the woods of Durham, N.C., the city that Ian, Eric and Brittany grew up in for a few years. Most of them were working several odd jobs to make enough money to stay afloat and pay for costs associated with being musicians. Though they were relieved to get the record deal from Warner Bros., they quickly realized that havingonly one job doesn’t always mean less work. “As hard as our first years were, the first year when we were signed to Warner Bros., we worked our guts out,” Ian said. They were happy to be furthering their sound with the technicians and producers that worked on their first full-length album, but exhaustion was setting in. “We had 13 shows in a week when we were doing South by Southwest,” Hopkins said. “We dealt with a lot of vocal exhaustion.” Much of the content on their latest album was about their personal stories. With that level of introspection, they have been able to navigate many of their successes as a band with level heads. All Good People is now on iTunes. We are donating our proceeds to Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC. https://t.co/xAHFemupue— Delta Rae (@DeltaRae) July 3, 2015. Though Hopkins mentioned that they aren’t big “celebrators” when they achieve new accomplishments, there are some moments that grab hold of them. One of those moments happened during the album release party for their first full-length project, “Carry the Fire.” “When we returned for the encore, all of these people in the crowd had these torches that a few of our fans had made that made it look like they were holding fire. It was incredible to see all of these people in the audience holding these torches,” Hopkins said. In their stride as musicians, sans the illusions of grandeur, they continue to move onward, finding ways to effortlessly combine all of their varied influences. A Frankenstein of genres, Delta Rae is the millennial embodiment of the South. Their music sometimes sounds of plantation chapels, and other times, it sounds like hootenannies in cotton fields, but what never changes is the need to tell a story. It often doesn’t have an ending, but such is life.",

    "LabBody": "The filmmakers even wrote an updated, texting-centric scene riffing on the original “Vacation” episode in which all of the car’s passengers, including the driver, fall asleep going down the freeway, though it didn't make it into the finished film. There is a also nod to the signature Truckster, which in this version becomes the tricked-out \"Tartan Prancer,\" a kind of James Bond car of misfortune. (The actors spent enough hours in that car that their ersatz lives began merging with their real ones. “When you’re together all the time like that, you kind of become like a real family. We developed a world of our own jokes. Or we pretended not to hear John and Jonathan when they were giving us a note we don’t like,” said Gisondo. Incidentally, his character's bullying--by his younger brother--is another 2015 spin, bringing into the modern era the inter-gender squabbling of the original.) Still, this is an R-rated New Line comedy more than a Phil Lord-Chris Miller postmodern jazz riff. Cow collisions and accidental cesspool dunkings figure prominently. The new \"Vacation\" boasts big set pieces, as in the rafting scene, and lots of red-band humor, via a misunderstanding between father and son over an explicit sex act and a motel stay featuring unexpected bathroom substances. Some of the movie’s broadest moments take place during a detour to the home of Audrey and her comically beefcake husband Stone (Chris Hemsworth, in a rare comedic performance). Stone is an alpha type who gets some of the bigger laughs thanks to—how to put this--a strategically placed prosthetic, awakening fresh questions in Rusty about how his wife regards him. Goldstein and Daley initially wrote \"Vacation\" as a PG-13 script; this was, after all, about a family. But at the time a few comedies with the softer rating had failed, while R-rated comedies were hot. Executives went back to the writers for an R-rated pass. The result is one of the few movies about everyday parents and kids that the former might not want the latter to see. (The 1983 film was an R too but a soft one, and it came out before the creation of the PG-13.) Perhaps the biggest deviation from the original lies in the lead character. Helms offers a different kind of patriarch than Chase — less the smirky schemer and more the sweetheart schlemiel. \"I may be a little similar to Rusty in my own life,\" Helms said. \"I'm the goofy optimist who thinks things can always work out.\" Of the actor’s appeal, Goldstein noted, “There’s a blend of innocence and likability that allows you to empathize with him even when he makes his own problems.” On cue, after shooting wrapped for the day, Helms decided to join a little kayaking expedition. He donned a suit and nose strips and jumped with his vessel into a rushing stream. The kayak promptly capsized, disappearing its pilot and eliciting a momentary where’s-Ed moment of panic among the land-bound crew. 'Fresh' but respectful' Sequels to classic movies bring out the naysayers and the timeline scrutinizers — just ask anyone who worked on \"Terminator Genisys.\" Some \"Vacation\" fans are understandably wary of a movie that invokes the Griswold name but follows the conventions of the modern summer sequel. Chris Bender, a \"Vacation\" producer, noted that \"what we needed to do was be fresh but also respectful. Which was terrifying.\" Indeed, the film's lineage can be its biggest selling point, but also its greatest obstacle. \"Wouldn't it have been funnier if they did something different, like Rusty and Audrey each had families with kids, and they dropped them off with Clark and Ellen, who had to take care of them as grandparents?\" said Barron, the original Audrey, in an interview. \"This just feels like it's repeating the idea of the first movie.\" (That idea has prompted some, including Barron and D'Angelo, to say they think of this as a remake, though New Line and the filmmakers regard it as a sequel.) Barron, who did not appear in the theatrical sequels, expressed frustration she and Hall weren't contacted for roles in the new film. \"It's a little odd that they're moving on like this, saying they're going back to the original but not including the original Audrey or original Rusty,\" the actress said, in comments that highlight the tricky task of updating a classic. Still, the appearance of Chase and D'Angelo will offer continuity to the original, even if their roles are small enough that, as D'Angelo quipped, \"I think I'm the highest paid actress, by line, of anyone in Hollywood this year.\" The rules of narrative have also changed since 1983. The enjoyable slackness of the first film — plot lines digress to nowhere; consequences are non-existent — doesn't really work in today's more structured storytelling world. The filmmakers acknowledge they kept tighter screws on the story than the original, especially in its last act. The new movie also comes at a moment when the idea of an American vacation is changing. A recent 60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll found that two-thirds of Americans would gladly trade vacation days for more money, and nearly 70% of Americans under 30 saw checking emails when not at work a reasonable requirement — an attitude that might make the idea of a fancy-free road trip play a little less convincingly than it did 30 years ago. Every generation gets the new version of a classic it deserves, as has often been said of Shakespeare and, lately, “Spider-Man.” The original \"Vacation,\" made by filmmakers who came of age in the '60s and set in a taboo-busting era, had a kind of nihilism about the traditional family. The new movie, made by filmmakers who came of age with Oprah and set in the family-values era, has greater concern for the preservation of a marriage. In that way, \"Vacation\" may be subject to a criticism about today's R-rated comedies: for all their gross-out humor, they are actually culturally less subversive than their predecessors. The filmmakers say it's a label they're happy to wear. \"There are inherently emotions that are going on in a road trip. The original was about undermining those emotions and sentimentality, and even the family unit,\" Goldstein said. \"Our movie is a little different. We didn't want to shy away from making a movie about a marriage that's not where it should be and someone setting out to fix it.\" Added Daley, \"What's changed since the comedies of the '80s is that audiences do appreciate when there's a sweetness and a relatability.\"",

No matter where he finishes in the Dakota Classic Modified Tour, Jason Grimes of Jamestown can at least say he had a perfect night. Grimes stole the show at Mandan's Dacotah Speedway on Friday, winning his heat race and the modified feature. And, for a clean sweep, he drew the pole position for the feature race. \"It was a perfect night -- the heat and feature,\" said Grimes, who jumped from 30th place to 18th in the points standings via his shining performance at Mandan. \"Obviously it's a lot better to come out on top of the deal. (Mike) Hansen really made me work for it there at the end.\" The 34-year-old Grimes, who has been driving since 1998, finished the 11¼-mile, 30-lap feature in 10:19.802 to edge runner-up Lucas Schott of Chatfield, Minn., by just over a second. He had a 1.13-second advantage on Hansen, the Dickinson driver who finished third. Jett Big Eagle of Manor, Saskatchewan, led early in the feature, but Grimes took over the lead on the 12th lap. Hansen moved into second place on lap 18 and pressed Grimes until Schott claimed second place on the penultimate circuit of the three-eighths-mile banked clay track. Big Eagle and Jeff Taylor of Cave City, Ark., rounded out the top five. With the victory, Grimes picked up a $2,100 winner's check and 40 points to run his tally for the DCMT to 106. He placed 23rd in the tour opener at Minot and missed the second stop at Estevan, Saskatchewan, unable to clear customs. He ran 12th at Williston and 22nd at Dickinson before putting on his one-man show at Mandan. The tour wrapped up its week-long run on Friday at Jamestown Speedway, Grimes' home track. Missing the Estevan show extinguished Grimes' hopes of contending for the tour championship. Tour leader Ricky Thorton Jr. of Chandler, Ariz., left Mandan with 179 points and a pair of determined pursuers nipping at his heels. Aaron Turnbull of Estevan stood second with 171 points and Taylor was third with 170. Taylor won last summer and Turnbull took honors in 2013. Grimes became the fifth man to win the modified feature in five tour stops. Ryan Ruter of Kanawha, Iowa, won on opening night at Minot. Taylor prevailed with a wild finish at Estevan and Thorton topped the field at Williston. Jason Wolla of Williston claimed the feature race on Wednesday at Dickinson. Grimes, competing on the DCMT for the first time, said it's not surprising to him that no one has been able to win twice. \"You have 80 to 90 of the best cars in the country. It's a pretty tough deal,\" he said. \"Let's hope I can be the first repeat winner.\" Although he was effectively out of the running for the DCMT title after the second night, Grimes said he's still racing as hard as he can. He said the same is undoubtedly true of the other 97 modified drivers who competed Thursday night at Mandan. \"No matter what, I come out and want to win every night,\" he said. Grimes is in racing up to his ears. He's driven bombers, streets, B modifieds and modifieds in his 18 years of racing, the latter since 2007. A couple of years ago he began building cars -- his blue No. 99 is a Grimes Racing Service product. \"I built three or four B modifieds for 2014 and three or four last winter. This is my first A modified,\" he said, looking at his No. 99. \"I also do Integra Racing Shocks, so I'm a busy guy,\" he added. Grimes said he doesn't race at Dacotah Speedway often, so he didn't have an advantage over the drivers who came in from long distances. He said adjusting to various tracks is part of the racing game. \"Adjusting to the track and the car is everything,\" he said. \"... We made a few chassis adjustments on the car and it still needs a little work yet, but I'm not going to complain.\" Elijah Zevenbergen of Ocheyeden, Iowa, picked up his second victory on the companion stock car tour on Thursday, completely running away with the 25-lap feature race. Zevenbergen posted a winning time of 17:16.535 to outrun runner-up Joe Flory of Williston by 5.7 seconds. Andrew Altenburg of Truman, Minn., placed third. That enabled him to boost his lead with 190 points. Joe Flory of Williston moved past his son, Dalton, into second place with 171 points. Dalton is third with 143 points. Thursday's show drew 98 modifieds and 37 stock cars. Copyright 2015 Bismarck Tribune. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

To celebrate their 78th birthday this coming Friday, July 10, the famed doughnut eatery has decided to sell a dozen of its glazed-goodness dough bits (you know, doughnuts) for a whopping 78 cents. Like Us on Facebook Which we can all agree is rather wonderful, isn't it? The Huffington Post reports that while the company has officially announced their deal to sell a dozen doughnuts for 78 cents, there's a little catch involved: the 78-cent dozen will be the SECOND set of 12 doughnuts you purchase that day. Meaning, of course, that you need to buy one dozen doughnuts at regular price, and then you can purchase the second for 78 cents. What a bummer, we know. But hey, look on the bright side, you'll then have 24 doughnuts for the price of basically one dozen. So, there's a silver lining, right?

    "DiffbotBody": "The rumored “Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo” smartphone is back in the news after a small hiatus. According to reports, a brand-new device was spotted in the Wi-Fi interoperability certification site, and it's believed to be the S5 Neo. The smartphone entry tied to model number SM-G903F has apparently received Wi-Fi certification. When a device gets a Wi-Fi certification, the site gives away key specifications and features. Sam Mobile says the model number matches the device the site discovered earlier, so Samsung could finally be launching the Galaxy S5 Neo. As far as the key Galaxy S5 Neo specifications go, the handset will reportedly be identical to the 2014 flagship Galaxy S5 in many ways. The device will come with a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display, aided by a full HD screen resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Under the hood, the Galaxy S5 Neo will reportedly be powered by a 64-bit octa-core (Samsung Exynos 7580) processor, running at 1.6 GHz. In comparison, the flagship Galaxy S5 comes powered by a Snapdragon 801 processor. Plus, the Neo will be backed by a modest 2 GB of RAM unit and the graphics side will be taken care by a Mali-T720 GPU, notes GSM Arena. On the software front, as expected, the handset will run on Android 5.1 Lollipop OS, straight out of the box. And the device will come equipped with 16 GB of in-built storage capacity. The Neo will reportedly sport a 16 MP rear-facing camera unit. In addition, it will flaunt a generous 5 MP front-facing snapper unit for selfies and video chats. Furthermore, the entire configurations will be held together and powered by a good 2,800 mAh battery unit. In addition to the standard connectivity options, the Galaxy S5 Neo will support LTE Advanced or LTE-A. Notably, the Galaxy S5 comes with only the standard LTE support. To top it all off, this Neo device will be released in single-SIM and dual-SIM models. In the meantime, an earlier rumor out of the Czech Republic stated the price of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo will be $490 equivalent. Even though this device cannot be compared to the South Korean tech giant’s Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, for a mid- to high-end handset, the specifications sounds like a good deal. Samsung has not confirmed the Galaxy S5 Neo specifications or price thus far.",

    "LabBody": "State Rep. Steve Doyle is calling on Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to reject a part of the biennial budget that the governor himself proposed to eliminate one health care program and switch another from nonprofit to for-profit. The Onalaska Democrat sent a letter to Walker on Thursday urging him to retain the Include, Respect, I Self-Direct program, also known as IRIS, and not to put Family Care in the hands of for-profit agencies. The programs “were designed to keep our elderly and disabled out of nursing homes and institutions and to cut down on Medicaid costs,” Doyle said. IRIS is credited with saving millions in Medicaid money, and an estimated 3,500 people in southwest Wisconsin, including 2,000 in La Crosse County, depend on Family Care, which was piloted in La Crosse. Like others objecting to Walker’s proposals, Doyle said switching Family Care to a profit-oriented model will jeopardize the quality of care and seniors’ care choices. “As a representative from one of the Family Care pilot counties, I have seen firsthand how vital and transformative these programs have been for my community,” said Doyle, who, as a member of the La Crosse County Board, helped launch Family Care.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Washington's NFL team already knows what its next move is to protect its trademark: appeal to a higher court. But what it's doing and what it should be doing, according to at least one crisis communications expert, may be at odds. Daniel G. Hill, president of Ervin-Hill Strategy in D.C., said his advice to the team and owner Dan Snyder is to \"rip off the Band-Aid'' after U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of the Washington NFL team's federal trademark registrations. \"The team is in a difficult spot,'' said Hill. \"At some point, they are going to have to stop fighting it. The problem with these kinds of issues, race issues and things like that, is you can have great facts on your side. Dan Snyder can do polls of Native Americans and others who support the current name, but you only have to offend a small group for it not to work.'' Ervin-Hill, in the crisis communications side of its public relations business, works with athletes and sports teams, among others, when tricky situations arise. Hill wouldn't name specific clients on the crisis side for confidentiality reasons; Ervin-Hill also works with athletes through the company's Pro Impact service, which consults and advises on image branding (professional boxer Heather \"the Heat\" Hardy is one Pro Impact client). Hill said Washington's NFL team will likely eventually be forced — for financial or other reasons — to change the team's nickname and Hill doesn't see the social pressure letting up any time soon, even as the team has vowed to forge ahead in the court system, and its next step is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. How would Hill handle it? \"The way I like to tackle these things is if I know eventually I have to do something, I do it more immediately, even if it doesn’t fit with what I want or what my client wants,'' said Hill. \"If they eventually have to change the name they should get it out of the way. This is sports; you’re not going to lose your fans. The Wizards are as popular today as they were when they were the Bullets. \"[The team] is treating this like a mundane legal matter. Arguing the name is historic doesn't really do anything in light of what's happening in the country. The name has color and 'skin' in it. And those two things, right now more than ever in the last 50 years, we need to get away from. Them fighting it at this particular moment makes absolutely no sense.\" If the team continues to fight, via the appeals process — the case would be heard by a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit. and it must file within 30 days of Wednesday's ruling — it will be a lengthy battle. Jesse A. Witten, the lead attorney for the Native Americans fighting the trademark fighting the team over the team’s trademark protections, said the appeals process could take 18 months \"plus or minus a few months\" to play out. If the team loses and wants to appeal, it would have to go to the Supreme Court, which picks and chooses the cases it hears.",

    "LabBody": "All Royce O’Neale has ever needed on a basketball court is an opportunity. He has always taken the rest from there. So, this past week, when O’Neale went from playing just 10 minutes in the Boston Celtics’ opener to 20-plus in the final two games — more than Boston first-round pick R.J. Hunter in that span — it wasn’t anything new to the Harker Heights product turned undrafted free agent. “It’s kind of like being overlooked a bit,” said O’Neale, who starred at Denver before becoming a two-year starter at Baylor. “But I’m just going out there and doing what I do best.” What O’Neale has always done best is impact the game on both sides of the floor with his uncanny rebounding at 6-foot-6 and ability to create for himself and teammates. He hit his only shot from the field and pulled down four rebounds in just 10:52 in the opener before playing 20:34 in the next game against the Philadelphia 76ers. In that game, O’Neale hit a pair of buckets to lead all scorers at the end of the first period — the only one that ended with the Celtics ahead — and finished with five rebounds as well. His final game against the San Antonio Spurs saw him score just two points on free throws but not without dishing out a few assists and swiping a team-high in steals also. His playing time increased again in that game, up to 24:45, and with the team preparing to head to Vegas for its second league, O’Neale was happy to have left an impression. “I impacted the game offensively and defensively and then I was just a team player,,” O’Neale said, “encourage all the guys whether I was on the court or on the bench, so just being that player.” O’Neale admitted the speed and physicality of the game has been an adjustment, especially when going against players who have NBA experience. But O’Neale, as always, is making his presence felt as well. Now, he just hopes that this opportunity turns into a second one down the line as he hopes to one day have an impact for an NBA team. “It’s a process,” O’Neale said. “I just take it day by day, just do what I can. “Hopefully be able to get a phone call saying that a team wants me to join. So, I’m just exploiting every opportunity I can get.”",

    "LabBody": "Burglar and fire alarms will no longer be monitored by the Salina Police Department under regulations approved Monday by the Salina City Commission. But that’s nothing to get alarmed about, said Weston Wilson. His company, Wilson Security Solutions, is prepared to take over those services at a reduced cost. The new regulations were enacted to reduce the number and expense to the city of false alarms. Last year, the Salina Police Department responded to 2,506 alarms. Of those, 99 percent were false alarms, costing the department $48,527. The Salina Fire Department responded to 309 false alarms through June 2 of this year, at a cost of $46,331. As part of the regulations, the city’s emergency communications center will quit monitoring alarms. Deputy Police Chief Sean Morton said the new alarm ordinance takes effect on Nov. 1, but customers have 180 days to find a private company to take over alarm monitoring. “We have an alarm panel in our communications center that is very old,” Morton said. “We’re not going to replace it. We are giving people plenty of time to move to a different service.” The new regulations also provide for fines to be issued for false alarms, although those have not been set by the city commission, he said. New systems are cellular. Morton said the police department is monitoring 191 alarm systems currently. Alarm users pay a $30-a-month fee for the monitoring service. Wilson said his company will monitor the alarm systems currently being monitored by the police department for $9.99 a month and at the same time reduce the number of false alarms to emergency services. Wilson Security’s new alarm systems use cellular technology, which can’t be disabled. Monitoring for the cellular service costs $21 a month. He said there are no multiyear contracts, which often are associated with national security services. “You call us and we’ll come out. It takes about 15 minutes, and your alarm is monitored,” he said. Call made to check alarm. His company will also keep track of the alarms, which satisfies the new Salina registration regulations. Wilson Security also sells alarms. “You own the equipment and we just charge you a monthly monitoring fee with no contract. That’s the way we do it,” Wilson said. Wilson said the company also will assist in eliminating or reducing false alarms. “If an alarm goes off, we call you first. We will call either your home phone or your cellphone. We’ll say, ‘This is Wilson Security. Is everything OK?’ We ask for your name and a preset password,” he said. If the correct password isn’t given or if there’s a problem, law enforcement or the fire department is immediately notified. Discretion for false alarms. Fire Marshal Roger Williams said the fire department will register commercial alarms, but a third party will have to provide the monitoring service. He also said discretion will be used in determining false alarms. He gave the example of burning toast causing an alarm to sound. “While we were en route, they canceled us and said it was a false alarm,” he said. “Well, that’s not a false alarm. The alarm did what it was supposed to do. Just because we didn’t have to respond didn’t make it a false alarm.” However, if a business is under construction and fails to notify the fire department and an alarm goes off, that could be considered a false alarm. — Reporter Tim Horan can be reached at 822-1422 or by email at thoran@salina. com.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "When Morgan Geer began recording his latest project with his band, Drunken Prayer, he decided to make a more cohesive record. “It's the most thematic record I've ever made,” he said. “It's like one person put all of their money in a jukebox.” Maybe, but only if that jukebox was located in a Mississippi juke joint a few decades ago. The country-rock-soul songs from Geer, a Black Mountain, N.C., native, sound like the drunken child of Hank Williams and Jason and the Scorchers. While “The Devil and The Blues” won't officially be released until Aug. 18, Drunken Prayer is playing several pre-release shows, including a stop at The Mothlight in Asheville, N.C., at 9:30 p.m. Friday. Copies of the album will be available at the show. Geer said he is doing the pre-release shows because he is about to begin touring with his other musical commitment: He is the guitarist for alternative country band Freakwater. This record, the third full-length album by Drunken Prayer, was recorded in Asheville, overdubbed in Portland, Ore., and mixed over via file sharing. That doesn't change the cohesiveness of the music. “This record is more focused,” Geer said. “There's more levity and it's closer to a party record. Before it has been more stream-of-consciousness, it would be cohesive because it was coming through me. “There'd be a country-flavored song and then a soul song. This record is more narrowed down. Someone told me it was like a soul band playing country music. There's not a lot of steel guitar but there are some horns.” In the past, Geer has split his time on the two coasts, living in Portland where his label (Fluff and Gravy Records) is and in Asheville (where family is). He flew back and forth playing shows, until it made more financial sense to stay on the East Coast where more venues are located. “For live purposes it made more sense,” he said. “As we were pondering that decision, our son was born and that was more incentive to stay close to family.” Geer plays with a variety of musicians across the country. The record was made with the rhythm section of Lance Wille (drums) and David Wayne Gay (bass), who play with The Reigning Sound. “I've got people I can play with all over the country and can repeat the process, not just in Portland, but in Seattle, Southern California and Austin (Texas) and all over,” Geer said. “I'm lucky to have a lot of friends who are great musicians living all over the country. I couldn't just do it pulling people off Craigslist.”",

    "LabBody": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) today decided to include India as a full member, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offer to work with the six-member grouping to enhance connectivity, combat terror and create an environment for boosting trade by easing barriers. India, which has an Observer status for the past 10 years, will technically become the member by next year after completion of certain procedures. Beijing-based SCO currently has China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan as members. Along with India, the process to include Pakistan as a member was also initiated here today. “I convey our deep sense of gratitude to the members of SCO for accepting India as a full member,” Modi said after the announcement was made at the Summit, attended by leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. “Our membership of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is a natural extension” of the relationships that India has with member countries “and mirrors the region’s place in India’s future”, he said. Noting that India’s membership “reflects the natural links of history”, he said, “It will also promote peace and prosperity in this vast region that has often been called the pivot of human history.” Modi said the membership also advances the shared vision to reconnect and integrate Eurasia’s different region. India was made an Observer in the SCO in 2005 and it made an application last year for full membership of the grouping whose focus is on connectivity, counter-terrorism cooperation, bolstering cooperation in energy sector, enhancing trade and dealing with drug trafficking. “We will work with SCO to combat terrorism and extremism that is a rising threat to the entire region. A stable and peaceful Afghanistan is a future that the Afghan people richly deserve, but it will also advance peace, stability and prosperity in the region,” the Prime Minister said. “As we look forward, we would lend our support to improving transportation and communication networks in the region. We can create a vast network of physical and digital connectivity that extends from Eurasia’s northern corner to Asia’s southern shores. The International North South Transportation Corridor is a step in that direction,” he said. Modi, who attended the SCO Summit soon after his bilateral meeting with Sharif, congratulated Pakistan for joining the SCO. “I also take this opportunity to congratulate Pakistan on joining the SCO,” he said.",

On a new episode of his talk show web series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, with incoming Late Show host Stephen Colbert, Seinfeld makes a joke about transgender people after seeing Colbert's daughter's car. The first joke, asking if his daughter is having a sex change, is tacky but relatively inoffensive. Colbert laughs it off. Then he doubles down: To Colbert's credit, he seems utterly unamused by the joke, basically ignoring it entirely before the shot is edited away to the next: Seinfeld's joke arrives on the tail of his recent complaints about political correctness in comedy, particularly among younger people. He recently said he doesn't play colleges and is frustrated by policing of language. \"They just want to use these words: 'That's racist;' 'That's sexist;' 'That's prejudice,'\" he said, according to Entertainment Weekly. \"They don't know what the hell they're talking about.\" Watch the full episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee on the show's website.",

    "LabBody": "Nissan’s global compact car is yet to make a strong India connect. It was India’s largest exported model last fiscal with an impressive tally of 75,000 plus units. More recently, its manufacturer celebrated the occasion of the 500,000th car exported from the subcontinent where the Micra accounts for a lion’s share. Yet, when it comes to the domestic market, sales of Nissan’s premium hatchback barely average 700 units a month. Company sources say the automatic version launched this week is the first step towards addressing this problem. The occasion was to commemorate five years of the Micra at a glittering function in Mumbai. This lavish display was perhaps ironic given the Micra’s tepid showing in this market even while it has been super successful on the exports front. Yet, company sources insist that this marks the beginning of a turnaround strategy. Starting trouble “Indian customers are moving to automatic cars and the 4th generation CVT will meet this need. We believe the brand has the potential to grow,” they say. The Micra ended up facing a series of headwinds which possibly thwarted its growth here. When it was launched in 2010, Nissan had an arrangement with Hover Automotive for distribution of its cars. It was only after the two parted ways did the company kick off the process of creating its own outlets across the country and expand the customer base. Also, from the viewpoint of a hardcore business proposition, it just made more sense to export the Micra. This was precisely the reason why its production was shifted from the UK to India to make the most of a cost-effective base. Nissan logically prioritised shipping out the model to those countries where it was already well established and in constant demand. It also ended up being a profitable option as a result. In addition, the automotive slowdown in India through fiscals 2012 and ’13 hardly helped the Micra’s cause which, in turn, justified the export business model. Small wonder then that the last five years have seen over five lakh units shipped out from India while domestic sales in contrast have been a minuscule portion of this number. In the process, Nissan’s growth also languished at a time when India was critical to its Power 88 plan (eight per cent global market share by 2016). The lacklustre showing of the Datsun has only made things more difficult which means the company needs to step on the gas real fast. Next year will see another compact car to join the Datsun family. Back on track For the moment, though, Nissan will be keen to increase the presence of the Micra. Officials say work has kicked off in right earnest with dealerships across the country now geared up to push sales more aggressively. Customers need to be told of its strong points including the fact that it is the country’s top-selling export model. “Conveying the pride-of-ownership message is top priority,” say officials. Nissan is only too aware of hardcore market realities like the formidable hold of Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai which have a combined share of nearly 70 per cent with more price-competitive models to offer. There are also other rivals to contend with in the premium compact space, a list that includes Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota, Honda and Tata Motors. Yet, the positive side to this tough climb is the fact that a growing mass of young buyers across every nook and corner of India is open to the idea of trying out new brands. In today’s era of smart phones, getting information about a new model is a cinch. This is something that Nissan will be banking on as it goes about the task of putting the Micra back on track. Yet, it cannot ignore the reality of reaching out personally to each of these buyers in its dealerships. By the end of the day, buying a car in India is still a family-led decision which means dealerships will have to be completely geared up to meet the challenge of connecting with customers. It is the only way the Micra can hope to be a part of more homes in the country.",

    "LabBody": "Quick, can anyone name the most dominant force in all of sports over the last 25 years? No, Mr. Brady, it’s not the New England Patriots. But how’s that new air pump working out for you? And I know most New Yorkers in the Big Apple think they need a passport to cross the Hudson River, but the Yankees have been missing the winner’s circle by so far in recent years that even George Steinbrenner’s ghost can’t save them if he fires Billy Martin’s ghost. Manchester United? No. Wow, I didn’t know the Brits turned out for this one. Two words, Red Devils fans -- “Malcolm” and “Glazer.” That ought to shut you up. You get partial credit for “New Zealand All Blacks,” who have been atop the International Rugby Board rankings for all but about a month during the last 10 years, but they’ve still won only two Rugby World Cup titles. So, no. The answer I’m looking for is “American women.” American. Women. The U.S. soccer team’s victory over Japan Sunday in the World Cup final is only the latest in a long line of sporting triumphs for American women, including three World Cup victories since the event was established in 1991. In every Summer Olympics since 1992, the U.S. women have won or tied for the most combined medals in track and field and swimming. In softball, this country has been so dominant that the IOC dropped softball and baseball from the Olympics at least partly because no other nation could mount meaningful competition. And the United States won the first-ever Women’s Rugby World Cup in 1991, which might be the most remarkable award, independent of gender, in our national trophy case. To win that title, the United States sent our fourth-and fifth-tier women’s athletes -- the ones who couldn't make international teams in basketball, soccer, softball, track and field or swimming -- and entered them in a sport that they likely had never seen before they started playing it. Then they beat top female athletes from nations that play rugby in the schoolyard. It’s no coincidence that the U.S. female sports dominance began in the early 1990s with a generation of girls who had lived nearly their entire lives in a post-Title IX country. Title IX, the 1972 federal law requiring gender equality at institutions receiving federal aid, was not intended as athletic legislation. The law was supposed to enable more women to access educational opportunities, and consequently, professional opportunities. But Title IX’s greatest impact has probably been felt on the playing field. Because of the law, colleges had to offer women parity in athletic scholarships -- and at many institutions, including the University of Pittsburgh, create women’s intercollegiate athletic programs where none existed before. That, in turn, meant women competed against one another not only for victory on the field, but for opportunities to earn college degrees for free or at a greatly reduced cost, which resulted in improved performance. By 1990, when women who were still in preschool when Title IX passed reached college age, the law’s impact on international competition began to manifest itself in the form of medals and trophies. Title IX isn’t without controversy. Just up the road from here, Grove City College contested the regulation in court as a federal intrusion on its mission. The law has been interpreted to require athletic participation gender ratios reflecting university student population, which has caused the elimination of several college wrestling programs to pay for the creation of women’s gymnastics teams. If you raised a glass Sunday for the U.S. women's soccer team, you should also toast the cause of gender equality. Because the Americans could have won the World Cup without Abby Wambach or Pittsburgh-area native Megan Klingenberg. They might have even won it without the tournament's top goal scorer, Carli Lloyd, or goalkeeper Hope Solo. But they couldn’t have won it without Title IX.",

    "LabBody": "Today: Facebook is running into data-sharing conflicts with its advertisers, some even calling the social network \"like the NSA.\" Also: Twitter exec Adam Bain is reportedly the frontrunner to be the company's next CEO, and Apple iPhone sales projections get raised. The lead: Facebook shares up despite being called \"like the NSA\" from advertisers. Facebook jumped up 2.41 percent, or $2.07, to $87.95 on Friday, but the social network is running into issues with its advertisers. A new policy to be enacted on Nov. 4 will bully advertisers into turning over valuable data regarding its users that publishers believe should be theirs only, Venture Beat reported. Publishers told Venture Beat that giving Facebook this data would be unfair, as Facebook could then sell it to rival publishers who would then be allowed to target their own users. Providing Facebook with this data without appropriate permission may also violate the privacy of the users of the app. This new policy is reported to roll out in two stages. First, Facebook will no longer provide publishers \"device-level attribution data,\" which publishers consider essential, as it helps advertisers understand who is using the app and who to target for adds. With the second stage, if publishers want the data, Facebook will assist them with their demographic calculation only if publishers give Facebook their own data, which includes device-level ID, other apps the user has installed, how much users have spent on the app, among other things. One publisher told Venture Beat that \"Facebook is like the NSA,\" and the controversial second stage of the policy is still being negotiated. A recent study estimates that the mobile ad market will be worth $100 billion next year. Facebook has been making major plays to advertisers as of late, especially in video ads. In the Menlo Park social network's latest efforts to dethrone YouTube, it is reportedly trying to get music videos on people's news feeds, explaining why Facebook has been in talks with music labels, reports the New York Times. Some music videos will be rolling out in the coming months to test their performance. After the recent changes to the news feed, which allows users to decide which stories go at the top, brands are hoping to be pinned to ensure users see their content all the time. Facebook told the New York Times that advertisers will \"get the chance to persuade those fans to add them to the 'see first' list so they don't miss a thing,\" implying another revenue avenue that Facebook can get money from its advertisers. In more humorous news, a Russian official has criticized Facebook for restraining users' freedom of speech and is asking Russian countrymen to use domestic social media instead, which, to no surprise, is heavily censored itself. Some users are also misusing Facebook's name pronunciation tool to protest against the \"real name\" policy. SV150 market report: New Twitter CEO rumored, Apple iPhone sales projections raised. U.S. stocks were up after Greece proposed new reforms to creditors, leaving investors optimistic that the Athenian nightmare will soon be over. Twitter was up 1.64 percent, or 56 cents, to $34.92, as Business Insider reported that Adam Bain, president of global revenue and partnerships at Twitter, could be the next CEO. Despite this news, Nick Bilton of the New York Times says the San Francisco company is a \"mess,\" given that half the board is former Twitter CEOs, \"and the other half aren't tweeting.\" In less/more flashy news, Twitter has been forced to pull down Vine ads that were \"massively dangerous\" to those with epilepsy. \"Star Wars\" has also added a red lightsaber emoji -- #lightsaber -- to Twitter, because, you know, why not? Apple jumped up 2.67 percent, or $3.21, to $123.28, as analyst Travis McCourt from Raymond James raised his estimate of third-quarter iPhone sales to 50 million units from 46 million. McCourt also lowered Apple Watch projections, despite noting that the watch is \"by far the best selling smartwatch of all time.\" Apple Watch users are also reporting burns and rashes on their wrists, and other users are complaining about stains on their MacBook retina displays. EBay was up 0.97 percent, or 60 cents, to $62.37, as Toys \"R\" Us announced it will be taking control of its e-commerce operations, no longer relying on eBay's Enterprise unit, a blow to San Jose company's attempts to sell off the Enterprise unit. However, Reuters reports that private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP is looking to acquire the Enterprise unit for close to $1 billion. Tesla shares were up 0.48 percent, or $1.23, to $259.15, as the Palo Alto electric car company has hired former Burberry executive Ganesh Srivats to be vice president of North American sales. Electronic Arts jumped 2.23 percent, or $1.57, to $72.07, as the Redwood City game publisher's stock reached an all time high. LinkedIn was up 1.15 percent, or $2.39, to $209.95, as research firm Mizuho called the Mountain View networking site's stock a top mid-cap pick with a buy rating and a $240 target price. Google was up 2.10 percent, or $11.46, to $556.11, as the Mountain View tech giant said it catches 99.9 percent of Gmail spam. Advanced Micro Devices was down 1.01 percent, or 2 cents, to $1.96, as Zacks recommended that investors drop AMD in favor of other semiconductor stocks.

At Comic-Con on Thursday, two of its stars -- Halle Berry and Jeffrey Dean Morgan -- and the executive producers sat down to gab about what fans can look forward to on the rebooted drama. Berry quickly recapped what happened to her character Molly in Season 1: She adopted a robot, went to space, and got impregnated by an alien. Then it turned out her alien son aged super fast. Then he died, and then the robot son got taken away, and then her husband got hit by a train. Then she got committed to, and subsequently escaped from, a mental hospital. This season has lots of fun stuff coming: It turns out her alien son isn't dead! But more importantly, Jeffrey Dean Morgan will be there. Morgan said his character, JD Richter, a cop investigating a series of mysterious deaths, and Molly \"meet at a crime scene and sparks fly.\" Berry said she was excited to have a man interested in her character. \"Finally, a man that wanted to kiss me! My husband last season didn't want to come near me,\" she said. Executive producer Craig Shapiro said they were excited to see the chemistry between Berry and Morgan, saying it \"fizzes\" on screen. \"Jeffrey and I do swap fluids,\" Berry teased. \"You gotta wait for it!\" Also something to look forward to: A kick-ass fight scene in the finale. Shapiro wouldn't say who Molly fights, but promised \"it's an amazing fight scene to wrap up the season.\" Berry also briefly touched on why she went from a successful movie career to television. \"I felt like, TV is the new frontier,\" Berry said. \"The best writing is on television. There are great characters for women and women like me, my age group, my ethnicity, and I felt like to go do some quality work, which I was finding hard to do in the film world, I would go to TV. ... Television is where it's at right now.\" Extant airs on Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS. Page 2 of 2 - (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)

Now 31, he has been cast as a kind of brash hero of our cash-obsessed era on \"Million Dollar Listing San Francisco,\" Bravo's new reality show. It premiered Wednesday. If you watch, you will get to know him, fast: He's the one who refers to his two competitors -- agents Roh Habibi and Justin Fichelson -- as amateurs who were \"going to the prom\" when he was already a seasoned professional. In conversation, Greenwell -- based in Pleasanton, where he founded and runs Venture Sotheby's International Realty, which has 60 agents -- turns out to be less confrontational. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Andrew Greenwell, CEO and principal of Venture Sotheby's International Realty, is photographed July 8, 2015, in San Francisco. Greenwell is one of three Bay Area real estate agents who star in the San Francisco edition of Bravo's \"Million Dollar Listing\" reality show. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) Q Are you surprised to find yourself on this new show? It presents you and your two competitors as if you were pop culture icons. A I don't know if I'd call myself that. I'm just a real estate agent with a camera following me around. Q Tell me about the drama of the deal. Why does it translate to TV? A When you're dealing with someone who has large assets, the emotions run raw and there are no rules. It's a no-rules game. It's one of the most stressful and crazy things about the business, but it's also what makes it exciting. You can get up in the morning and close a deal by noon, but you can also totally lose that deal by noon. Q On the show, you come across as unusually competitive. A You have to be. This is a high-stakes game. There's no messing around. Q Is the show already bringing you new business? A Yeah, I think it's really going to ramp up. People come through an open house and the cameras are there -- it adds a little extra level of desire for them. People want to feel close to the show, close to the brokers. Q Do you feel any remorse over being someone who helps drive this crazy real estate market? The region is becoming unaffordable for most people. A I don't think that brokers and Realtors encourage the crazy market. We simply facilitate transactions. I think one of the things that differentiates me is that I have a business background. My brokerage will do close to $500 million in sales this year, but I actually don't like crazy markets. It's not healthy. You can't sustain it. I have not enjoyed the markets of the last few years in the city and it's actually been slowing down and that brings me great joy. null FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT Andrew greenwell 1 He married Paal Salvesen in April; they celebrated for a week with 40 guests on a 330-foot yacht in the Caribbean. 2 In December, he and Salvesen will travel to Cambodia and visit a rescue, rehabilitation and employment center for survivors of sex trafficking. It is affiliated with 3Strands Global, a charity they support. 3 He cites \"work\" as a hobby: \"I don't know what I'd do without real estate. I might implode.\" 4 He was selling real estate in Seattle when the stock market crashed in 2008: \"I was literally flat broke. I was stealing toilet paper from my condo building.\" 5 His mother is one of his heroes: \"For 30 years, she was CFO of an incredibly large construction company. ... She's a force to be reckoned with. Imagine being a woman in construction in the '70s.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "The state Board of Land and Natural Resources might restrict nighttime, nonvehicular access to Mauna Kea. Ikaikamaiki Keone-Kinimaka visited Mauna Kea on June 26. State officials released Thursday a long list of issues and problems linked to Thirty Meter Telescope protesters ahead of Friday’s state Board of Land and Natural Resources meeting to consider restricting nonvehicular nighttime access to the Mauna Kea summit region. A proposed emergency rule would restrict access to anyone not traveling in a vehicle on Mauna Kea Access Road from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. The rule would also prohibit camping gear, including blankets and tarpaulins, within 1 mile of the road at any time. Friday’s 9 a.m. meeting is the Land Board’s regularly scheduled meeting in Conference Room 132 of the Kalanimoku Building, 1151 Punchbowl St. While state officials have said the emergency rule is designed to promote safe access to the summit and is not necessarily aimed at any one group, the protesters contend the rule is specifically targeted at them and intended to prevent them from blocking construction of the $1.4 billion TMT project near Mauna Kea’s summit on land they consider sacred. On Thursday the state released three months of activity logs maintained by the University of Hawaii’s Maunakea Visitor Information Station and Office of Mauna Kea Management rangers, along with some highlighted incidents that officials say illustrate the need for the emergency rule. Incidents recorded at the visitor center include bomb threats, theats of violence against TMT workers, glaring and staring at center staff members, yelling in the visitor gallery, harassing visitors and staff, vandalizing the bathrooms, suspected shoplifting of souvenirs from the gift shop, disrupting center operations, smoking marijuana and blocking the road. Incidents observed by the Mauna Kea rangers include the illegal construction of shelters and cultural features in the forest reserve near the visitor center, plus the discovery of invasive ants and plant material — including black bamboo, ti leaf plants, a monkeypod tree seed pod and guava sticks — identified as high risk for introduction of invasive species. According to their logs, rangers also reported hostile and intimidating comments and gestures directed toward observatory workers and visitor center staffers, plus damaged and defaced property. In addition, they reported a drop in the number of commercial tours visiting the summit. Dan Meisenzahl, UH spokesman, said the hostile incidents are not representative of all the protesters. On several occasions, he said, some of them have helped to defuse some situations. Leaders of the “protectors,” as they call themselves, maintain that their three-month presence on the mountain has been generally courteous and respectful, required only by the need to prevent desecration of the sacred mountain. They also say the group practices kapu aloha and aloha aina in a tradition of nonviolent protest and respect and integrity for the land. Mauna Kea Access Road and the Maunakea Visitor Information Station have been closed to the public since a June 24 clash with a TMT work convoy that resulted in 12 arrests. With the help of rocks and boulders placed on the gravel road above the 9,200-foot level, protesters turned back the TMT work crews ascending the mountain to try to restart construction of what’s expected to be one of the most powerful optical telescopes in the world.",

Where He Wins: A very unique back for his size. Ajayi is very fluid and can really create yards in the open field. He has straight line speed and flashes beating contact against smaller defenders. Other times, Ajayi goes down easily and fails to locate holes behind the line of scrimmage. Ajayi would thrive in a Matt Forte/Marc Trestman receiving back role.

The college was generous, covering most of the $26,000 tuition, but that wasn't enough. Then, BB\u0026T stepped in. The powerful banking company, with a strong presence across the Southeast, gives Morales $2,000 to $3,000 each year toward her education. \"It's very helpful,\" she says. \"This scholarship makes all the difference. My mom\"—she supports three children on a $13,000-per-year kitchen-worker's salary—\"definitely couldn't afford to pay for that.\" The scholarship, which is administered by the Hispanic League, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, is only an example of the bank's attentions toward young, undocumented immigrants. BB\u0026T has held dozens of public forums to educate the public on a deportation-relief program since the Obama administration put it into place in 2012. Called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), it allows young undocumented immigrants who meet certain age requirements and pass a criminal background check, among other preconditions, to stay and work in the United States without fear of being deported. Morales is one of the 664,000 foreign-born youths approved so far by the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, and she has spoken voluntarily about her experiences at several of the bank's forums. \"I guess I could be a bit biased,\" she says, citing her scholarship, \"but I've personally talked to other banks, and I don't see them trying to reach out to the Hispanic community nearly as much as BB\u0026T.\" Even so, enthusiasm for—or at least openness toward—the White House's immigration-friendly policy risks putting the bank in the path of a political firestorm. Republicans reacted with anger to President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which bypassed Congress in issuing reprieves on deportation starting in 2012. Obama further stoked controversy last November when he tried to add an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants to the ranks of those eligible for deportation relief, an expansion blocked by the courts. Potentially riskier for BB\u0026T, opinion polls suggest that half the public dislikes the idea of protecting immigrants who've arrived illegally. The bank denies taking part in partisan debates. \"We don't take a stand on things that are not related to the banking business specifically,\" says Luis Lobo, an executive vice president of BB\u0026T and manager for multicultural markets. This may be especially wise in the Southeast, where anti-immigrant feelings run strong and where the bank, headquartered in Winston-Salem, maintains many of their nearly 2,000 branches. Still, the potential benefits to BB\u0026T's business may well be worth the risks. The proportion of foreign-born Americans has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, from less than 5 percent in 1970 to roughly 13 percent, according to the latest census data. A company known to be a champion of immigrants' rights can hope to attract their dollars. BB\u0026T wants immigrants to feel comfortable approaching the bank for financial services, according to Lobo. The discussions the bank has started about deportation relief have \"been a way for us to reduce the intimidation level ... between the banking industry and these communities,\" he says. Typically, at each of BB\u0026T's forums, an immigration attorney explains how the government's program works, and a beneficiary will tell her or his personal story—a signal that the bank won't discriminate against immigrants as customers or employees. Indeed, BB\u0026T prides itself on the diversity of its workforce. The bank hasn't sought out workers enrolled in the DACA program, Lobo says, but \"any number\" of them now work for the bank. As an immigrant himself, from Costa Rica, \"that's become a huge fulfillment in my life,\" he says, \"seeing that these folks aren't intimidated and are willing to apply for a job with BB\u0026T.\" The bank hasn't been shy about its sympathies on immigration. \"BB\u0026T has been very proactive in letting folks know what they're doing,\" says Monica Fuentes, chief service officer for the city of Atlanta, who worked with the bank on a forum in February. Unlike most information sessions, she notes, the event explained in detail how undocumented immigrants can use a bank account to show their presence in the United States, which is a requirement of the government programs to forestall deportation. Citigroup and Bank of America have also sought to build relationships with immigrant communities, but Fuentes says she's unaware of other financial institutions besides BB\u0026T doing anything this aggressive around deportation relief. BB\u0026T officials insist that the main reason they reach out to immigrants is to educate the public. But they acknowledge they wouldn't mind if the freshly educated happened to open a bank account. They seem to have Yazmin Garcia Rico in mind. Now 26, she arrived in the United States from Veracruz, Mexico, without papers in 2002, and resides in Burlington, North Carolina. Authorized to work because of DACA, she spoke about her experiences at one of BB\u0026T's forums. \"I don't have an account with them,\" she says, \"but after that experience, I thought that I would really like to support them.\"",

    "LabBody": "Pamela Varma Brown. That name is familiar to many on Kauai. She is known, perhaps more than anyone, as the person who tells the stories of the people of Kauai. She told them well in “Kauai Stories,” which was published in 2012. And she is back with “Kauai Stories 2” that was recently released. There are stories about growing up in Kauai. Stories about the Hawaiian language. Stories about hog farms and grocery stores. Stories of surfing, seashells and fishing. Ghost stories, too. The topics range, but the one constant you’ll find in each is they are filled with the heart and soul of their subjects. That’s because Brown is one of those persons that people trust. They believe in her. They see good in her and they have confidence in her. They like her relaxed manner, her calming spirit, her friendly smile. And they know when they’re talking, she’s listening. So they share their lives with her so she can put them in print. Brown has called Kauai home since moving here 26 years ago. She came with a degree in journalism, a career in the insurance industry and a desire to meet people. These days, you can find her most mornings swimming at Morgan’s Ponds (“It’s just a great way to start the day,” she says), riding her bike, practicing yoga and spending time with her partner, Lincoln Gill. She finds great joy not just in telling the stories of Kauai’s people, but in people reading them. And learning from them. “If you like knowing about people, you look at someone and wonder what makes them tick, how they got to where they are and how they got how they are, these stories are for you,” she said. “And these stories are fun and interesting and inspiring, whether you know about Kauai or not because they’re all real people.” As real as they come. Just like Pamela Varma Brown. ••• The Garden Island: Why did you decide to write “Kauai Stories 2”? PB: There’s so many good stories on Kauai, I couldn’t help myself. For a really small island, we have a lot of fascinating people here, people who have done a lot, seen a lot, have triumphed over adversity, a lot of very happy people here. So many dimensions for people who have been born and raised on Kauai, or who come here from other places. I just find their stories fascinating. I’ve been a story junkie since I was a kid. I’ve been hearing more and more stories and thought, “Wow, this would make another great book.” I really didn’t know I was going to do another book until I finished the first “Kauai Stories” at the end of 2012 and then more and more stories kept coming. I thought, “Wow, I really need to do another volume.” I started it pretty quickly; it took awhile to finish because I had so many other things on my plate. I thought it was done last December, I had it going through the proof-reading process, had five proofreaders, started doing the photo selection, then two more fabulous stories dropped in my lap that belonged in the book. TGI: How do you pick the people for your book? PB: They come from all different places. Sometimes someone tells me about somebody I should talk to. Sometimes I’ll bump into them or somehow have an encounter with them. And as soon as they start talking, I’ll know if this is a story I want to write. Sometimes I know it’s a prime story for my book. And sometimes, I know it’s a story for my column. And sometimes, it goes in both. I can’t really describe how I know. I just have a feel for it. Some stories have a longevity, so if a book like “Kauai Stories” or “Kauai Stories 2” sits on a shelf for 20 years, I want somebody to be able to pick that up and feel like the stories are fresh, whether the people are 20 years older now. I really want stories that are going to have a strong, positive impact while representing Kauai very well. TGI: Is it easy to get people to share their stories? PB: For the most part. Sometimes, yes, very easy. Sometimes, it depends who asks. Sometimes if somebody very close or has a relationship to the person says, “You need to tell your stories,” then they will. What’s also been such a blessing is people knowing they can somehow trust me. And I don’t know how that is. I know I have integrity, but until you know somebody, you don’t know that about them. So, for the first “Kauai Stories,” there’s hardly anybody whose stories are in that book I knew before that book, and they somehow trusted me to do a nice job with them and represent them well and represent the island well and positively. Now, more and more people are telling me of someone I should talk to because they’re close with them and they’ve seen my writing. They’ll tell them, “This one is going to be OK.” Sometimes, I’m talking to people who are hesitant they’ll be misrepresented, but that’s the last thing I want to do. I find it a real privilege to interview them and hear their stories. TGI: Will you spend hours interviewing someone? PB: I find it most effective just to sit down and talk so their thoughts are very focused. And like most of us, people’s thoughts will bounce all over and that’s where the editing comes in. Because I do more than just transcribe their story and print it. There’s a lot of editing that goes on because almost none of us speak in a super coherent fashion and I’m sure I’m not either at this moment. But sometimes, they want to go out and show stuff. TGI: Do you remember the people you’ve interviewed? Do they have an impact and influence on you? PB: Totally. You know what’s been fascinating is, I have been somehow led to talk with people who have something in their story that’s relevant to something I need to learn, and I don’t know that at the time. Like, for example, in “Kauai Stories 1,” I talked to Vic Allen. He’s a man who went blind when he was 38. He’s a big, strong guy and he paddles on a team and he also solo paddles. He says he goes in the ocean almost every day. That’s kind of hard for sighted people to imagine. The day I went to see him, I was moping about something in my own life, having some kind of difficulty, and I met him. He’s one of the happiest people I’ve ever met. Watching him, I go, “What is my own problem?” Something they have learned in their life they have been able to teach me, and I hope they’re teaching other people, too, what we can all accomplish as normal human beings. It’s a lot more then we normally give ourselves credit for. One of the pleasures and privileges I have of capturing people’s stories like this is knowing that not only have I found a great story to tell, but something about this person’s experience is going to inspire other people. Everyone I talk to has just been an awesome person. I like to share that with everybody. TGI: When did you start your writing career? PB: I didn’t do it commercially until 2003. I’d write a little bit on the side, but not much. I’ve been an insurance agent since ‘82. I would just write a little on the side. I used to be very involved in Rotary so I’d do their press releases. In 2003, I said, “I want to write for real.” I remember even seeing the quote marks in my head. I don’t know what that means, but it means, not just as a hobby. So I started writing stories and I would submit them to The Garden Island and another publication and I would just give the stories for free. Nobody had a budget and I didn’t have clips and I just started doing real interviews and sending in the stories and they’d publish them. Little by little people started calling me, asking me to do other stuff. But I had this other career all along. So it wasn’t until 2007 I started doing a lot more with it. In 2007, I was asked to edit a publication called Kauai People. It functioned as a precursor to Midweek. Midweek wasn’t here then. It was only on Oahu. Kauai People came out every week and it was chock full of stories about Kauai People. There was nothing in there other than Kauaian content. TGI: What do you like about life on Kauai that makes you want to write about it? PB: Everything on Kauai is fun. I’ve always liked the laid-back vibe here. I like that it’s so relaxed and you’re allowed to be whoever you want to be without judgment. You can be whoever you want to be anywhere in the world I find it easier on Kauai because people are more accepting and realize you might be more than your particular job title you hold at the moment. I find that people on Kauai and Kauai as a whole see you as a whole person. People are accepting and encouraging. So if it’s taking up a hobby or starting a new career, or whatever, people really want to help you with whatever you’re doing. TGI: What do you hope people come away with from reading your books? PB: What I want is for people to get a lot of joy from reading these stories and to be inspired and to be educated in a lot more fun fashion than we normally learn things. TGI: Will there be a “Kauai Stories 3”? PB: I might. I am pondering it. TGI: Do people know you as the person who writes the stories of Kauai’s people? PB: Surprisingly, yes. I like to do yoga at the beach. I go real early when it’s just the handful of people who go real early and exercise. We all know each other. One time I’m at the beach doing yoga and this guy who swims there fairly often comes up and says, “Hey, you Pam Brown. I like your stories.” I’m good with names and faces, so I recognize people even when they don’t know me. I’ve had people come up to me, I had no idea they knew me. I had one guy come up to me, he took both my hands in his hands and said, “I love your stories.” I was in tears. I didn’t even know he knew my name. And he just went on and on that he knows the people I write about. It was exactly what I hoped people take away, that they feel they know these people I’ve written about. TGI: Why do you suppose your books have had such an impact? PB: Human nature is, the more you know about somebody, the more you like them because you understand them more. You have a clear picture of who they are, why they are the way they are, and their whole persona makes more sense to you. What I like that happens from these stories, is that folks who read them come away with more of an understanding of what Japanese immigrants, for example, had to compete with when they came here to make a new life for themselves, how amazing a third generation has gone to college and they own homes. Where people come from, it’s a lot of times very different than what we see on the outside. And I like that the more we can learn about each other, the more tolerant and understanding we can become of each other. It’s just natural, yeah? ••• To buy “Kauai Stories” and “Kauai Stories 2” or to find out where they are available, go to www.kauaistories.net.",

    "LabBody": "CHICAGO (TNS) — Inside a suburban Milwaukee convention hall in June 2012, Wisconsin’s Scott Walker had just learned he’d become the first U.S. governor to survive a recall election when his old friend Reince Priebus hugged him. The Republican National Committee chairman then handed Walker his iPhone. Mitt Romney, their party’s soon-to-be presidential nominee, was calling with congratulations. Priebus and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan have been conduits to national power for Walker, all three of them fortysomething products of the same patch of Wisconsin dairyland. Yet as Walker formally enters the 2016 Republican presidential race next week, his rivals will be watching for favoritism. The party’s chairman, in particular, is supposed to be neutral. “Reince is a lawyer, so he understands the concept of conflict of interest,” said Pat Brady, a former chairman of the Illinois Republican Party who was a national committee member when Priebus was first elected in 2011. Since World War II, the RNC chairman during contested primary campaigns has always been from a different state than the eventual Republican nominee. That streak would end if Walker were to win the nomination and Priebus remains until his term ends in January 2017. Super-PACs and other outside organizations have diminished party influence in picking nominees. Still, Priebus will play a critical role in organizing sanctioned events and sharing data and other resources with candidates. Priebus has a history of looking out for Walker, 47. In 2010, Priebus was state party chairman and Walker was a Marquette University dropout who had gone on to become the Milwaukee County executive and a gubernatorial candidate. Priebus sent Walker an e-mail warning of an attack planned by a primary opponent, Mark Neumann, a Republican maverick who had earlier ceded the party’s endorsement to Walker. Priebus’s subject line: Neumann Confidential. “Neumann will be looking at two areas very soon — the county debt and how it is calculated — something about ‘mortgaging the future’ and why Walker dropped out of college,” Priebus wrote. The e-mail, released in 2014 as part of a criminal investigation into political activity in Walker’s county office, shows the candidate forwarded the information to aide Cindy Archer. “Get me all the facts I can get on the debt,” Walker wrote to Archer. An RNC spokeswoman said Priebus wouldn’t play favorites among the party’s 2016 field. “Chairman Priebus and the RNC have and will continue to remain neutral in the primary process until we have a nominee or a presumptive nominee,” Allison Moore said in a statement. Priebus has already indirectly helped Walker’s nascent presidential campaign. Our American Revival, the political committee that’s his presidential campaign in waiting, is filled with staff members tied to Priebus. Walker’s presumptive campaign manager, Rick Wiley, is a former RNC political director who worked for Priebus, as did communications manager Kirsten Kukowski. Other Priebus alumni from the RNC on Walker’s team include political director Matt Mason and deputy political director Wells Griffith. Walker and Priebus also share donors, including Diane Hendricks, a Wisconsin billionaire roofing-supply executive who is Walker’s top individual giver. Before Priebus became chairman, Hendricks had given about $38,000 to the RNC since 1990, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Since he took the helm, she has given more than $500,000. Walker rarely mentions Priebus in public appearances. More often he gives a shout-out to Ryan, the Ways and Means Committee chairman and 2012 vice presidential nominee. It promises to be a mostly one-way conversation. Priebus has essentially removed Ryan from the primary battlefield by appointing him chairman of the party’s “presidential trust.” The entity raises money that will be spent in coordination with the eventual nominee’s campaign and Ryan has said it means he must remain neutral. Still, when Walker spoke in May to almost 100 members of the House Republican caucus in Washington, Ryan introduced him.",

IKEA Group, the Swedish home furnishings company, today announced the purchase of its first land parcel to build retail stores in India. The company is also evaluating suitable sites in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi NCR (National Capital Region) to open 25 stores in the long term. The IKEA Group is the first major single brand retailer to get FDI approval in India and plans to open several stores in these cities. The 13-acre site is close to the IT hub in Hyderabad’s HITEC city. A typical IKEA store will see an investment of ₹500-₹600 crore, according to a company press release here today. According to sources in the State industry department, the Telangana Government had offered the Swedish major land at ₹19 crore per acre along with several incentives and support. Hyderabad already hosts global retailers such as Walmart, Metro Cash \u0026 Carry. IKEA has been sourcing from India for the 28 years for its global stores. In India, it has 50 suppliers with 45,000 direct employees and 400,000 people in the extended supply chain. The Chief Minister of Telangana State, K Chandrasekhara Rao, said: “We believe that IKEA will bring best business practices, great employment opportunities and contribute to the overall development of the city. It’s a priority for the state government to attract global brands which can bring modern processes, global know-how and innovation.” Juvencio Maeztu, Chief Executive Officer, IKEA India, said: “India is a very promising market for IKEA as it offers us the opportunity to source, retail, conduct CSR initiatives through IKEA Foundation and empower social entrepreneurs through Next Generation projects. “Our focus now is to bring all of it together in Hyderabad as we have bought our first land to build an IKEA store. “We will bring a unique shopping experience through our inspiring stores offering affordable home furnishing products.”",

    "LabBody": "History offers a great many examples of individuals, groups and societies that lived too much in the moment and compromised longer term prosperity - or in some cases (think Easter Island) even survival. It’s the same with climate change today. We’re past the point where we can debate whether to act. We can either act prudently and account for long-term risk or face catastrophe. Want proof? One: almost three million people in the US live less than three feet above the average high tide, according to a recent report from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Two: s after Hurricane Sandy, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was fiscally insolvent, and required legislation and a $28 billion taxpayer bailout to fix temporarily. Three: sea levels on the northeast coast of North America rose 128 mm, or over five inches, in 2009-10 alone, and we’ll likely need to prepare for more extreme sea level rise in the future. Broader consequences are worse: the Stern Review estimated a loss of 5% of global GDP, “now and forever,” by not addressing climate change. Business as usual, in short, is a recipe for economic decline. That’s why an economy wide carbon tax would, far from being a burden, be economically beneficial for the United States in the long run. It’s time for Congress to create one, especially now: with fossil fuel prices as low as they are, the short-term pain of imposing a tax is as low as it’s likely to be for quite some time. It is normal to think that a new tax would depress economic growth, but that’s not necessarily the case - and it’s also a short-term view. This is also a moment when the options to replace the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels to make electricity are economically attractive, with solar and wind at or near grid parity. Carbon taxes can help move us to a renewable electricity system without imposing a long-term burden on ratepayers. Moreover, not subsidizing fossil fuels, which the world does to the tune of half a trillion dollars, can save taxes. A carbon tax is the most efficient way to keep fossil fuels, which are a major driver of global warming, in the ground. That conclusion comes from the US Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that conducts economic and budget analysis for Congress. Efficiency, in this context, measures emissions reduction per dollar of administrative cost. The best part? Done right, there’s no reason this can’t help grow the economy, as well as tackle the threat of climate change. A good example is that of British Columbia. Its revenue-neutral carbon tax, instituted in 2008, has led to a 16 percent drop in fuel use (compared to three percent growth in the rest of the country) while its GDP growth kept pace with the rest of the country. A 2012 poll found that 64 percent of British Columbians supported the tax. Business groups often oppose new taxes, but that stereotype isn’t accurate this time. The 200,000 businesses represented by the American Sustainable Business Council has called for a price on carbon. They recognize how dangerous climate change could be if we don’t act, as evidenced by polling that shows more than half of all small business owners think it will affect their business - or already has. An economy-wide price would send a clear market signal that it is time to address the adverse economic impacts of climate change, such as rising food and transportation costs and expensive infrastructure upgrades. A tax could also substitute for various energy subsidies and reduce business uncertainty. It could also be used to reduce payroll income taxes. Some will fight hard against putting a price on carbon. It’s time recognize that the market has failed to account for the full costs of carbon pollution and that a national tax would bring about greater economic efficiencies. Prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels will only increase the eventual cost for the global economy. Taxing carbon is one effective way to avoid that cost.

    "DiffbotBody": "Thursday is Comic-Con's sucker baby — a day so easy you don't know what everyone was warning you about. We pretty much walked into the infamous Hall H on the first morning of Comic-Con 2015 — no wristbands and little waiting required. But there were already people camped out in line for the next day's panels, the wristbands for which wouldn't get handed out for 12 hours. The first panel of the day was reserved for Open Road, the distributor behind such films as \"Dope\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" With no description in the schedule, most, if not all, of those in attendance were just waiting around for something else later in the day — the \"Hunger Games\" panel or \"Doctor Who.\" When its start time came and went, some in my section speculated that it'd just been canceled. Then Bill Murray entered the room. Open Road used its hour in Hall H to promote \"Rock the Kasbah,\" a comedy in which Murray stars as a rock music manager who discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice in Afghanistan. It co-stars Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Zooey Deschanel, Scott Caan and Danny McBride, but all the movie needs to drum excitement is Murray, and the marketers know that. He entered through the crowd and answered the moderator's first question in character. The name cards on the dais often give away who's on-hand, but his read, \"Richie Lanz.\" In his first-ever Comic-Con appearance, Murray played to the crowd. \"I feel like I fit in,\" he said. \"I feel like I could fall down in any of these aisles right here and be left alone until I woke.\" What followed was a master class in fan appreciation. By turns funny and gracious, he flirted back when one woman offered to let him spend the night with her on the convention-center lawn. He encouraged a young man who was so nervous that his knees were shaking to move the shaking up to his hips and then to his arms; the kid did, dancing in front of thousands. He was philosophical and sincere, greeting even the most awkward and rambling questions with wit and grace. “I must say it feels wonderful to be in this room,” Murray said. “I like when people get excited about something. There’s a lot of people who don’t get excited about much at all.” With no warning that he’d even be there, it’s likely that no one in Hall H on Thursday morning was there to see Bill Murray. And “Rock the Kasbah” isn’t your typical Comic-Con film. But the move got some of the world’s most rabid pop-culture fans some face-time with one of the industry’s most personable stars — and got Open Road’s little movie in front of them.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Ships. Opium chests. Choppy waters. Warring continents. Flood of Fire, the much-awaited finale to the Ibis Trilogy is packed with all of the above, and much more. Recently, Amitav Ghosh gave Mumbai fans a taste of this heady adventure. Fiona Fernandez met with him to get the back-story of his epic work of historic fiction George Wittet's Gateway of India has a grey hue to it. After all, it's pouring outside. The monsoon is here, we're told. Call it timing or otherwise; we couldn't help but imagine similar brushstrokes paint a vivid picture from 1839-40, in the torrential waters around south China — the area where Amitav Ghosh's Flood of Fire ends in fine form. \"Yes, River of Smoke was launched around this time, too,\" smiles Ghosh when we remind him of the monsoon connect. Our introductions revisited, we are ready to set sail. Pun intended. \"I love being on water,\" when we prod early on, about why a ship forms such an integral part to the trilogy. \"It's such a wonderful thing to write about. It provides you with classical elements like time, place and action. So much can happen in a concentration of space. No wonder Agatha Christie wrote several titles centred on ships,\" he says, with a twinkle in his eye. Despite a packed, superhit launch (Aamir Khan was in the audience) the previous (Friday) evening, there's no trace of fatigue. This, even if we were to factor in an engaging one-hour interaction (Meeting Amitav Ghosh) with nine mid-day readers, barely an hour earlier. Easing into the conversation, he's happy with the way the Ibis Trilogy turned out. \"As I came to the end, it felt satisfying. I am glad with the way it worked itself out. I felt as if I was taking dictation from the book! It was on its own track,\" he quips, to which I ask, \"…like a boatman?\" Ghosh agrees, and we can gauge sea connect. Little wonder then, that when we speak a few moments later about the wondrous mix of languages and dialects in the trilogy, he shares about how nautical language was easy to incorporate — \"I grew up in Sri Lanka, where it's spoken freely. Sri Lanka (Ceylon) was an important stop for wayfarers and traders. Interestingly, I came across similar phraseology in Mauritius as well,\" he elaborates, helping me join the dots. By now, we're soaked in a socio-cultural lesson. The interview must make a re-entry, we realise, before our scheduled time slot runs out. Of characters and challenges So, we ask Ghosh to pick favourites from the trilogy. With a bunch of eclectic, insightful characters, each with their set of quirks, \"It's tough for me,\" he grins. \"They've all been difficult to create. A short pause later, he reveals, \"Bahram Modi was a great challenge. He was a businessman from Bombay who was dealing with opium. I had to enter a world that I was not accustomed to. It was a rewarding experience, especially from a sympathetic standpoint. In fact, he was the second character (Deeti was the first) that I thought of, when I began work on the trilogy. He has a very vivid presence, and is one of the most interesting characters in my entire writing life.\" When we nudge a bit, on whether he missed Bahram in the final book, he adds, \"He was there in spirit. But his wife Shireen was an interesting character as well. It's easy to relate to her, isn't it?\" As we carry on our discussion of the book's central characters — Mr and Mrs Burnham, Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesri and Neel, it's insightful to listen to (and read, earlier) the wizardry with which the reader goes on a seamless ride that pans continents and cultures, separated by water. \"How do you manage to balance the pace of one story such that it doesn't outdo the other?\" we quiz the Kolkata-born author. \"Well, I wish I had the answer!\" he shrugs, sharing a grin. \"At some basic level, it's about instinct. Besides, while working on such a long book, one cannot merely depend on the flow.\" Anybody who has read the trilogy will vouch for the imagery that takes over almost immediately. Like it did in our case. So when talk veers to these intrinsic elements to his craft, he replies, \"I think in a visual way. To be able to write a scene, I need to see it. It's the best compliment if my reader can also do this, while reading it.\" This, we were able to — from the moment we walked into our interview, forty minutes earlier, when dark clouds gathered over the Arabian Sea, in the picture postcard-like view from the hotel window. Just as Ghosh had imagined, possibly, when Bahram, and later, Shireen had set sail, as they stood on the threshold of rewriting their destinies. Quick bites On sailing the seas: I love to head out on sail ships. Most recently, my wife and I did this wonderful trip on an Indonesian cruise called Bugis Schooners. These cruise boats were originally made by a seafaring community called the Bugis. I found it was fascinating to experience Indonesia via water, what with thousands of islands that one encounters along the way. This included a visit to the Komodo Islands too, where we were greeted by many Komodo Dragons! On mastering languages: (laughs) I'm familiar with English, Bengali and Hindi, of course. Then, there's Arabic, and also Bhojpuri, which I learnt from my father who lived in those parts. This helped while writing Kesri's story. As for the language of the boat people, I researched from the archives in China. What's next? There are two non-fiction works. One of these is based on the research that emerged from the trilogy. The second will be based on a series of lectures that I conducted back in the United States. Climate change matters: What I would like to see is large-scale renewable energy sources that are easily possible and available in India. Instead of subsidising gas and power, why not offer subsidies for solar panels? After all, India is blessed with adequate sunlight. This strikes me most viscerally. Even in my home in Goa, I've tried to install solar panels, but have been plagued by so many obstacles. (Amitav Ghosh is a leading world voice who speaks on environmental issues and impact of climate change) Will there be a TV or film series based on the ibis trilogy? Yes, people have approached me in the past. But I don't think about it (smiles). Meeting Amitav Ghosh Malabi Das, one of the nine mid-day readers who participated in a Meet the Author contest held by the newspaper, won her a chance to interact with Amitav Ghosh yesterday. She narrates the experience The Ibis trilogy is complete; the Flood of Fire is on the stands; and, I am going to meet Amitav Ghosh! I could hardly believe it. And, there I was shaking hands with him; sharing a table with a bunch of very informed fans of the celebrated author. I went to the reader's session with Amitav without any expectation, but I came out smiling like a cat who got the cream. Did you know that Amitav Ghosh writes his first draft with a pencil on a sketch pad and the second draft with pen on ruled paper? And that he probably writes 30-40 drafts by the time his novel was done? In the warm, friendly atmosphere of the Business Centre at the Taj Mahal Hotel, Ghosh let us peep into his world — the world of Zachary Reid, Havildar Kesari, Shireen Modi, and Neel. So, how did he go about completing this colossal project — how did he handle the enormous historical data and weave it into these amazing works of fiction? \"Writing is like mediation. Every morning I sit on my writing desk and let my mind calm down, till it is like still water, and then I start to write,\" explains Amitav. Now that the Ibis trilogy is complete what can we expect from Amitav's desk next? It may not be another work of fiction for some time, but we can look forward to some non-fiction that he is currently working on. I must admit, I like his non-fiction as much as I enjoy his works of fiction. Thank you, mid-day! Signing off to return to my autographed copy of Flood of Fire (I am abandoning my copy on Kindle in favour of the hardbound courtesy, mid-day and Penguin Random House.)",

    "LabBody": "NORWALK — In what ordinarily would be a routine traffic stop for a driver having run a red light, is now an entirely different one thanks to insight from a small camera clipped to Sgt. Sofia Gulino’s uniform. With the flip of a switch, Gulino adjusts one of the Norwalk police department’s 35 new body cameras and prepares to address the driver she pulled over on East Avenue. “The cameras are going to 100 percent be a benefit to the department,” Gulino said. “I have absolutely been accused of saying things that I have not said in the past, so had I had the camera back then, it would not have even been a question.” Earlier this year, the department purchased 35 cameras for $50,000 through two private donations of $25,000 apiece. Currently in the process of being tested and set up, the cameras are due to rollout in the coming weeks. Gulino, who joined the department in 2004, is the first to take one of the cameras on a test run in an effort to learn the ins and outs and resolve any issues prior to training the rest of the department. Shaped like a pager, the cameras easily clip onto an officer’s shirt and are turned on when an officer receives a duty call. “You have to inform the person (on the call) that you are recording and keep the camera rolling until you complete the call,” Gulino said after giving a verbal warning at the traffic stop. “Technically, the cameras are a rather simple device to use once set up, but procedurally, it’s a little different. Say you’re out at a car stop and a juvenile walks by, do we have to flag the video? Or, if we’re sent to the hospital, we can’t record with patients getting treatment because of privacy concerns, but what if a fight breaks out and a doctor is attacked? So, it definitely gives you a pause.” At the end of a shift, Gulino said the cameras are placed into a charging station, which automatically saves the film files in a cloud storage unit and clears the memory from the portable unit. Failure to turn on the camera or follow established policy will result in the officer being disciplined. In addition, footage cannot be deleted and can only be accessed by administrators and the officer who captured the footage. Aside from documenting an arrest, body cameras, Gulino said, can serve as a safeguard for officers to reduce civil suits and protect them from complaints. “The cameras are definitely a benefit when it comes to people being on their best behavior,” Gulino said as she carefully surveyed city streets in her SUV. “Nobody, not yet anyway, has said, hey, turn that (camera) off! A victim or witness can request turning the camera off, but for a suspect, it becomes part of the investigation.” Despite the benefits, some officers, Gulino said, are apprehensive of the cameras while others are eager to put them to use. “We’re in a time where everything police officers do is questioned, so there’s a concern of how they (officers) will be judged from the cameras,” Gulino said. “But in the end, everyone is going to have to adjust regardless of which side of the camera they’re on. The public will get used to it and we’ll get used to it too.” With the recent passage of the Act Concerning Excessive Use of Force bill on June 29, police departments across the state of Connecticut can now be reimbursed for the purchase of body cameras. As a result, Police Chief Thomas Kulhawik said the department plans to seek an expansion of its body camera program, if indeed funds are made available to do so. In the meantime, the department will put the 35 it owns to good use. “In some ways, when officers write police reports, we can just paint a picture of what happened, while the camera can show other details,” Gulino said. “Both are important, but one shows a human perspective and the other shows the camera’s perspective. I think the biggest benefit overall will be that the cameras will provide more evidence and improve interaction between the police and the public.”",

But that sort of script might not have played so well this weekend at the John Deere Classic. If Jordan Spieth hadn’t found his game Friday at TPC Deere Run, if he hadn’t shot a 7-under-par 64 following an even-par round Thursday, if he hadn’t made the cut … well, we still would have a tremendous golf tournament to look forward to today and Sunday. But there would have been a few less people here to watch it. And there would have been a few less media here to chronicle it. Let’s face it, it’s really almost ceased to be the JDC this week. It’s more like the JSC. The Jordan Spieth Classic. The galleries following the 21-year-old Texan around the course have been larger than anyone could recall seeing on a Thursday and Friday. Spectators have stood six or eight deep everywhere he goes. JDC officials said Thursday attendance was up 34 percent. Media outlets that barely acknowledged the existence of the Quad-Cities tournament in the past have shown up in Silvis this week. The New York Times sent a reporter for the first time ever. ESPN has done live updates from the course. The Tokyo Broadcasting System is here. More media are expected to arrive today. Brian Harman walked off the course Friday after playing in the same group with Spieth for two days and shooting the exact same 36-hole score, and he looked like the Maytag repairman. Harman is the defending champion of the event but he had exactly one reporter talking to him. A makeable putt away, there were dozens of reporters and cameramen jostling, clawing and elbowing for position while they waited for Spieth. Harman was mildly amused and not entirely displeased to be below the media’s radar. “I’ll go home and sleep like a baby,’’ he said with a smile. Before Friday, it looked as though all this added attention and hoopla might be on the verge of evaporating. It looked as if the principal protagonist in this four-part melodrama might miss the last two acts. Spieth was tied for 101st place. He finally found himself Friday and vaulted 85 spots up the leaderboard. If he continues to play like that, the galleries may be 10 deep today. Tournament director Clair Peterson admitted he was kind of happy that Spieth rallied the way he did. “I think a lot of people are,’’ he said. Spieth was second-guessed by all sorts of people just for coming to the JDC. Many felt he should have shunned a tournament that helped launch his career so that he could go overseas to begin preparing for next week’s British Open. He has won the first two majors of the year and a victory next week at St. Andrews would put him in position to do things no one in the history of golf ever has accomplished. A publication called Business Insider had a big headline questioning why Spieth would come to a “small’’ tournament instead of going to England to get ready. It’s hard to say something is “small’’ when the first-place prize money is enough to buy three or four really nice houses in Bettendorf, but you get the idea. The alleged experts felt Spieth was making a tactical mistake. Can you imagine what the chatter would have been had he then missed the cut in that “small’’ event? The kid would have been lambasted from coast to coast. But the JDC would have been just fine. Spieth or no Spieth, we’re set up for a suspenseful, Hitchcockian finish. Harman, who did win this tournament last year (people seemingly have forgotten that), is right there with Spieth. So is Ryan Moore, who has been in the top 10 of the JDC two of the past three years and is among the top 40 players in the world. Zach Johnson, who won this tournament in 2012 and who has shot 26 consecutive rounds in the 60s at TPC Deere Run, is actually a stroke ahead of all those guys. And there is a whole bunch of players of lesser repute even closer to the top of the leaderboard. Spieth, Harman and Moore actually are tied for 16th place. This tournament has been decided by a stroke or less nine of the past 11 years. We look to be headed there again. “It’ll be bunched tomorrow and it’ll probably be bunched on Sunday,’’ Johnson said. “It makes for a great tournament certainly, a little bit of drama, a little bit of entertainment, certainly very competitive.’’",

Comic-Con is where we all go to get our fix on the television shows and movies that we love, and one of the most popular panels of the weekend was the HBO Game of Thrones panel inside of Hall H. The Game of Thrones panel was held on Friday and brought out stars like Natalie Dormer, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams and others. What it also brought was some answers, a little bit of closure and some bring questions heading into the frigid offseason for the series which usually features a complete blackout on information from HBO and the set of the show. There will be leaks, as there always are, but the Comic-Con panel did its best to skirt around the major issues that the series faces moving forward and mainly addressed what we’ve already seen. There were a few teases for the upcoming sixth season of the show, and the vision of George R.R. Martin versus that of HBO was addressed, but for the most part this was almost like and exit interview or a debriefing on what we witnessed and experienced last season on the show. Before we dig in for the winter offseason that is coming, let’s take a look at what we learned from the Game of Thrones panel at Comic-Con and what you need to know from the day’s biggest panel.

    "LabBody": "SPOKANE, Wash. — Shelter dogs too intense or feisty to be adopted are helping wildlife scientists by doing what comes naturally—running through the woods and sniffing for the poop of other animals. “But they don’t get to roll in it,” said Jennifer Hartman of Conservation Canines. “We’ve heard those jokes.” The noses of the canine misfits are being put to use in Pend Oreille County in a pilot project seeking more information about the interrelationships of wolves and other carnivores—as well as with their prey. The dogs are tools for studying endangered species and other wildlife that doesn’t require trapping or tranquilizing the animal. “These dogs have been contracted to work all over the world,” said Julianne Ubigau, a high school science teacher and eight-year veteran with the program based in the University of Washington’s Department of Biology. For example, Chester, a golden retriever mix, returned recently from a job of sniffing out bear scat in the French Pyrenees. Scooby, a black Lab mix, has been to Cambodia, Mozambique, the Alberta oil sands, Montana and most recently Mexico for mane wolf research. The highest profile Conservation Canines project in the Northwest involves dogs trained to put their nose to the wind in a boat and lead researchers to collect the floating poop of endangered killer whales. The new project in northeastern Washington seeks to learn how the revival of wolves in the region influences the diets of other carnivores and their prey. The right dogs can be trained within a couple of weeks to lead handlers to scat from specific animals so samples can be collected and sent to labs for analysis that can unlock secrets about wildlife dynamics. “We take the dogs that can’t find a home because they are too crazy to be chosen for pets,” Ubigau said. “We don’t want dogs interested in poop. We want dogs that are obsessed with playing ball. These are the easiest dogs to reward and train to do the job.” One of the selection tests involves walking through a dog shelter holding a tennis ball. “We look for the dogs that see the ball and quiver,” Hartman said. “Their eyes are focused on the ball. Everything about them indicates they want to play with that ball.” “Then we take them outside and hide the ball,” Ubigau said. “We watch how long the dog will focus on looking for the ball. We pick a dog that has an insatiable desire to play; it would hunt for the ball to exhaustion. That’s the dog for us. “We need dogs with a strong drive to hunt but not a strong drive for prey. Our dogs can’t be interested in chasing wildlife. Our goal is to be as noninvasive as possible.” Scat detection dogs are able to locate samples from multiple species simultaneously across large, remote areas repeatedly over time. Ubigau says sampling with detection dogs tends to be less biased than traditional wildlife detection methods such as remote cameras, radio-collaring, hair snags and trapping. The method can acquire more reliable information in a shorter a time. The five dogs being used in Pend Oreille County from a base near Cusick have been trained to sniff out the feces of any carnivore. “We can change that with a dog by the way we offer the reward, which is to play with the ball,” Ubigau said. In a project that focused on fishers, the handlers started by introducing the dogs to previously collected fisher scat. “The dogs caught on fast,” she said. “Before long, we noticed the dogs were often walking on logs because they quickly learned on their own that’s where they had a higher probability of finding fisher poop.” This spring, as Ubigau, Hartman and Jason Broderick began the pilot project, they trained the dogs to find scat from coyotes, wolves, bears, bobcats, lynx and cougars as well as deer, elk and moose. “We want data on predators and prey,” Ubigau said. In their first 30-day session this spring, the three handlers and their dogs collected 3,000 scat samples. “There’s a lot of poop out there,” she said, pointing to a freezer full of it. Now in the second of four month-long sessions, they don’t collect every pile of deer and moose droppings the dogs detect or they’d be competing with the coal trains for hopper cars to haul their load. “We’ve scaled back what we collect or we’d go broke (on the lab costs),” Hartman said. “We key the dogs more to finding fresh stuff, since the lab can get more data from poop that isn’t totally dried out.” DNA analysis enables researchers to track individual animals and make population estimates. But much more can be determined from scat, including diseases, hormone levels that would indicate pregnant females and diet. “The further you analyze, the more money it costs,” Hartman said. “We have to stay in our budget.” The handlers are systematically working the dogs in a 3,100 square mile study area broken down into 66 cells, each of which measures 4.8 square miles. The dog and the handler wear GPS units that log their course. Working with Ranger, the youngest and newest dog on the team, Ubigau drove to the edge of a new cell on Monday, fitted the dog with a reflective vest and guard that protects his chest from punctures when going over logs. She wore a backpack with plenty of water, specimen bags, bear spray and, of course, the all-important ball. Within 10 minutes of hiking into the forest, Ranger made his first find and sat to be noticed, his eyes locked on Ubigau until she came. Hartman had told the story about Scooby, on an assignment in Africa, finding a scat as a group of impalas spooked around the dog. “They were running and jumping behind Scooby, but he just sat focused on the handler as if to say, ‘Come on; I found your poop, now let’s play ball. I don’t care about these other goofy animals.’” Ranger was similarly focused until Ubigau approached, asked him to back up, which he did, and tossed him the ball for several enthusiastic catches. “This is what it’s all about for Ranger,” she said. The dog lay on his belly and continued to give full attention to Ubigau as she collected what she determined to be a bobcat scat and recorded the coordinates on the GPS. Then they moved on. “It’s a lot of stomping through the woods,” she said. “I’ve had people come out with me and say this is the best job in the world, following a dog through the forest. But after awhile, they change their tune when they see how much brush we crawl through, the bugs and weather, and then at the end of a session, when you’re the most tired, the dog will go uphill, always uphill, and find another poop.” Every dog has its own style. Lab mixes tend to range a little farther ahead than cattle dog mixes, but they all get the job done. The dogs, rescued from uncertain futures at the shelters, have found a piece of heaven with Conservation Canines. Chester, for example, is getting gray in the muzzle but still looking toward a good life in retirement. “This will be his last season,” Ubigau said as she let him out of his cage to exercise near the Pend Oreille River. He immediately came to a visitor, sat on his foot and leaned against his leg looking for a scratch. “He’ll be one of our ambassador dogs when we meet the public and go to science classes at schools. He’s as good at making friends as he is at finding poop.” Information from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com.",

    "LabBody": "Albert Einstein is credited as defining insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. While this statement is used for a variety of situations, perhaps it is nowhere better applied than when characterizing this country’s numerous attempts to eradicate poverty. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. At the time, 14.7 percent of Americans were living below the poverty level, according to the U.S. Census. Fast forward to 2013, and 14.5 percent of our citizens were poor. Jason Zweig of Money Magazine says there are many reasons for the lack of progress in this ongoing battle. In a Wall Street Journal article, he shows how most anti-poverty programs have not considered how people actually act. The hodgepodge of national, state and local incentives and programs designed to address this issue assume people will minimize risk and maximize activities that achieve short- and long-term financial well-being. This approach — the foundation for which can be found in 18th-century Enlightenment thinking — serves as the basis for classical economics, as well as for policy on taxes, savings and social welfare programs. Unfortunately, we know all too well that people do not always act rationally. If they did, they would optimize the amount of money they put in tax-fee savings and take full advantage of compound interest. Using this same logic, people would not buy lottery tickets because the probability of “winning big,” so to speak, is infinitesimal. Yet, buy them we do. People with the lowest per-capita income are the most likely to buy lottery tickets. We also know those who take out payday loans are paying phenomenally high interest rates. Yet such loans remain popular. We know that companies charge exorbitantly high interest rates to those who borrow on their pending tax return, but every tax season a large number of people do just that. Behavioral economics is a relatively new field. It documents the many ways in which human minds fall short of perfect rationality. Working with psychologists, behavioral economists develop incentive-based policies based on what we know about ourselves as humans. For instance, Lutheran Social Services developed a program, partially underwritten with a grant from the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation, to help people who were falling behind on their mortgage and other payments. Realizing people like to gamble, families who made payments on time became eligible for occasional drawings worth several thousand dollars. The results have been phenomenal, as the program has increased the financial well-being of participants. Behavioral economists at Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as several large state universities, have set up experiments using random groups to help people save. It is human nature to procrastinate, especially when it comes to retirement savings. With this in mind, behavioral economists designed experiments where two groups were told about the benefits of starting a tax-free savings account. One group was told they need not begin to save for five months. The control group was asked to start saving immediately. Within three years, the group that was offered the deferred savings plan increased their savings substantially more than the group that was told to begin saving immediately. Most in the latter group procrastinated; some never saved at all. Interestingly, the rate of increase in savings was more pronounced among those with low income as compared with middle-income families. Many other experiments are underway. They all share one common denominator: Behavioral economists figuring out human tendencies and then designing savings and debt-repayment plans, and other strategies that appeal to our natural instincts. This approach seems to work with people in a number of countries and with a variety of income levels, but it is most effective with those in the low-income bracket. Behavioral economics may be a way to address the seemingly intractable problem of poverty and poor money management. The alternative is the proliferation of programs that exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the problem. We should give some of the ideas of behavioral economists a try, because with few exceptions, doing what we have been doing over and over again simply isn’t working. Michael A. MacDowell is president emeritus of Misericordia University in Dallas, Pa., and managing director of the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation. He wrote this for The Philadelphia Inquirer.",

    "DiffbotBody": "http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/S-F-police-didn-t-investigate-gun-theft-before-6376393.php San Francisco police did not assign an investigator to look into the theft of a gun from a federal agent’s car — a pistol that is believed to have been used, four days later, to kill a woman walking with her father on Pier 14, authorities said Thursday. Police Chief Greg Suhr said that the June 27 break-in of a car belonging to a U.S. Bureau of Land Management ranger, which was reported to police, had not been assigned to an inspector by the time 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle was killed along the Embarcadero on July 1. Steinle’s funeral was held Thursday outside her hometown of Pleasanton. Suhr said he could not elaborate on why such a serious case had not been followed up on by an investigator. But Tuesday, the chief issued a department-wide bulletin reminding officers of the process in place for identifying “cases that require an immediate investigation.” Station and investigations bureau lieutenants, he said, should review each police report and decide whether to refer the case to an inspector, taking into account such factors as whether the crime is serious, whether it is solvable and whether there are witnesses. “It is the policy of the San Francisco Police Department to diligently investigate crimes in order to arrest and prosecute those responsible,” the Tuesday bulletin said. Theft is one of the prime ways in which firearms are diverted to criminals on the streets, with 1.4 million guns reported stolen in the U.S. from 2005 to 2010, according to the Department of Justice. The lack of follow-up in the burglary case, which raises questions about how the police force prioritizes investigations in a city that sees thousands of break-ins a year, is the latest turn in a homicide case that has drawn national attention, largely because of questions about the suspect’s release from San Francisco County Jail. Report immediately filed The Police Department has mostly stayed out of the fray as questions swirl over Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. The county Sheriff’s Department released him in April, even though federal immigration agents had asked that he be turned over for his sixth deportation. Sgt. Michael Andraychak, a police spokesman, said Thursday that while the burglary case was not assigned to an inspector, officers who responded to the initial report did “conduct a thorough investigation.” “They determined that there was nothing of evidentiary value at the scene and that calling out CSI was not warranted,” he said. “They searched the area for possible surveillance cameras and/or witnesses and located none. They had a citywide crime alert broadcast on police radio channels and a teletype was issued. All investigative leads were exhausted.” Andraychak said a senior on-duty inspector had “determined that the officers had done a thorough investigation and that there were no further investigative leads and no potential for a follow-up investigation.” Andraychak said Suhr’s bulletin was not a response to the gun theft. The car break-in took place downtown and resulted in the theft of a .40-caliber handgun — the federal ranger’s service weapon, which was in a bag, according to sources familiar with the matter. Dana Wilson, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman, said the ranger was in San Francisco on official government travel and immediately called police. Four days after the theft, police and prosecutors said, Lopez-Sanchez discharged a gun, striking Steinle — a stranger — in the heart on Pier 14. He was arrested and has pleaded not guilty to murder, with his attorney suggesting the shooting may have been accidental. In a jailhouse interview with television station KGO, Lopez-Sanchez said he found a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a bench. Gun recovered in bay Authorities believe Lopez-Sanchez tossed the gun he used into the bay after the shooting. Soon after, divers retrieved the federal agent’s gun from the waters. The agent’s gun, though, has not yet been definitively linked to Steinle’s death, police said. According to law enforcement experts, car break-ins are notoriously difficult to solve as they often take place quickly and without any witnesses. Any fingerprints taken from the scene may only prove that a person touched the car at some point. While not commenting on particulars of the recent break-in, Suhr said that because it involved the theft of a gun, the case should have been pushed higher on the assignment list. He noted that case assignment officers do not work weekends, and the break-in was reported on a Saturday. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, whose office is representing Lopez-Sanchez, said he wanted to know how the theft of a federal agent’s service weapon was not considered a higher priority. His office has long said that the Pier 14 case is more about the proliferation of guns in society than about immigration. “It confirms what every San Franciscan suspects: that police don’t bother to investigate auto burglaries,” he said. “If a federal agent losing his gun doesn’t warrant an investigator, the rest of us have no hope.” Chronicle staff writer Jaxon Van Derbeken contributed to this report.

Nick Ristagno, who also serves as chief of the Lake Dallas Police Department, has been one of many city employees under attack by some residents. One resident in particular, former council member Julie Mathews, has allegedly been making accusations about the city staff and council members on social media and during citizens agendas at council meetings. One of the bigger grievances against Ristagno is his holding of two positions. Many claim this is a conflict of interest, saying he is not doing a good job at either and some residents are in the process of persuading the council to remove him from the city manager position. At a meeting on Tuesday, residents gathered together at Nana's Cafe, a local restaurant, and discussed their dissatisfaction with Ristagno, claiming he is violating the law by serving both positions. “You can’t hold two offices that pay,” one resident said. According the Texas Dual Office Holding Laws, state law does not provide criminal penalties for holding two conflicting public offices or for other types of prohibited dual office holding. When asked about the dual position, Ristagno stated that he does not feel there is a conflict. He also said that he took the city manager position because of the state the city was in at the time he was appointed. “I would not have accepted the city manager position if the city had not been in the condition it was two years ago,” Ristagno said. Prior to his permanent position, Ristagno had served as interim city manager at least three times. He said he was approached each of those times about taking the position permanently but never wanted to. He did finally take the position to help the city. “I was approached but I had refused it because I wasn’t interested in being a city manager,” Ristagno said. “But the city found itself in a very precarious situation.” Both Ristagno and City Secretary Joni Vaughn said they and the council at that time consulted heavily with city attorney David Berman to make sure that Ristagno was able to be appointed by the city council to become the city manager. Berman could not be reached for comment on the matter. At the time Ristagno took the position, the city had been in financial turmoil. Lake Dallas was on the verge of bankruptcy and had a debt of at least $500,000. In 2013, around the time Ristagno took the city manager position, the city stopped spending money and instead began paying back loans from the banks sooner. The city said it better budgeted and under projected expenditures and as a result, bettered their finances. In October, the city received an A- rating from Standard and Poor’s, an American financial services company that publishes financial research and analysis and is one of the top bond rating companies for cities and major corporations. This is two levels up from the city’s previous rating of a triple B. Ristagno said he wonders why there are people who are upset with him now but did not voice concern when there was financial distress on the city. “Its interesting that when the city was at its financial worst that no one was interested Ristagno said. “And we wanted them to be.” Ristagno had been approached for a five-year contract but said he requested it for two years instead with a one-year option. With his two years ending in September, Ristagno said he isn’t sure if he wants to accept the optional year yet. So far there hasn’t been anyone who has shown interest in the position, but Ristagno said if it were up to him, he would go back to being just police chief. However he said he feels the situation doesn’t just involve him but the other employees who are also being targeted with attacks and allegations. “This is bigger than just me,” Ristagno said. “There are other employees that are involved that are being dragged through the mud. I’m hanging in there because of them as well.” Others claim Ristagno cannot be his own boss who reports to himself. The position of police chief typically reports all matters of the police department to the city manager. Again, Ristagno said the city consulted with Berman on to ensure that he would be able to be appointed as city manager. According to Ristagno, he has six bosses, those being the council and the mayor. “If I wasn’t doing my job well, I’m sure they would have kicked me out years ago,” Ristagno said. The council at the time of his appointment drafted his contract as city manager and the contract states that if he does not do a good job as city manager, he goes back to being just a police chief. Another concern is Ristagno’s past experience while working in The Colony. On social media, Mathews posted a 1981 article reportedly from the Dallas Morning News about Ristagno and his time in The Colony where he served as police chief for more than 10 years in the 1980s. The article states that at least six officers filed complaints against Ristagno for multiple reasons, some involving cover ups allegedly made by Ristagno. Ristagno would be police chief for at least nine years after the accusations were made. He was later terminated by The Colony City Council in 1990. When asked about his time in The Colony, Ristagno limited his comments saying he would tell of his time there at a later date. Along with upset over Ristagno’s holding of two positions, a group of residents are turning their disapproval of the city toward the council due to the result of recent council meetings. Supporters of Mathews have become more outraged by the city’s actions following Mathews’ removal from city council. Mathews ran for city council in the recent election and won against incumbent James Harper with 68.6 percent (276 votes) of the votes. Shortly after the election, Mathews was the topic of an item on a June 11 city council agenda for inquiry into conduct and possible charter violations. After executive session discussion and a public hearing to hear the violations, the council voted to remove Mathews from office. According to the city charter, interference with administration and directives issued to members of the staff by a council member is not permitted. Mathews allegedly violated this rule on multiple occasions by sending emails to city staff members requesting information and making directives. Many residents believe this was brought up by staff members who have had negative encounters with Mathews in the past. Ristagno and Vaughn however said this was brought to their attention by the city attorney who was included on the emails that were sent. The city issued a statement following Mathews’ removal saying that a town hall meeting would be conducted to answer any and all questions residents have. Officials anticipate many to come forward in hopes of acknowledging the grievances and complaints directly rather than through third parties. “We know there are a lot of questions,” Ristagno said. “And there are a lot of perceptions that are inaccurate.” That meeting is scheduled for Monday at 7:30 p.m. at city hall. Ristagno, Vaughn and members of the council will be present to answer the many grievances in hopes of clarifying any misinformation the city believes has been spread. Ristagno said he hopes that residents will come and attend to find what he says is the truth on many issues. “I ask that people do the decent thing and find the truth for yourself,” Ristagno said. “Come look at the facts and the figures. We have reports, we have documentation.”",

    "LabBody": "PEABODY — There will be no music or television at Peabody Tipico following a contentious hearing where angry city councilors complained of bad management and bad faith following a bloody fight there on June 6. Attorney Scott Masse offered a lawyerly defense of manager Idanis Duran’s business, attempting to narrow the hearing to a complaint that the little Walnut Street restaurant was playing both the radio and television before the entertainment license had been paid for and affixed to the wall. But an emotional response from Ward 3 Councilor Jim Moutsoulas climaxed with a 10-to-0 vote to not issue the permit. Tipico also faced a hearing before the liquor licensing board on Monday, but Masse pleaded for more time. That hearing will now take place on July 27. He had also asked the council to delay their hearing, but they refused, also on a 10-to-0 vote. Under questioning from assistant city solicitor Adam Buckley, who chaired the hearing, Peabody police Capt. Scott Wlasuk, head of the criminal investigation division, described police reports of the June 6 incident. At that time, victim Juan Torres told officers he’d been attacked while inside Tipico, then dragged outside while getting hit over the head with beer bottles three times. All this was said to stem from a disagreement involving Torres’ ex-girlfriend. Councilors expressed outrage that rather than allow police to consult the restaurant’s video surveillance system, Tipico management required officers to obtain a search warrant. Once they did, however, they discovered that the system’s backlog of recordings began on the day following the attack. It couldn’t be determined if the June 6 recording had been deliberately deleted, but, said Wlasuk, “They knew at the time we were interested in that tape.” For his part, Masse tried to stress that the officers responding to the fight on June 6 made no mention of the entertainment license. “Is there anything in the report that refers to television or radio?” he asked Wlasuk. It wasn’t until later visits seeking the video that police noticed the television and radio were in use. But this defense collapsed when Moutsoulas asked to speak. Moutsoulas described being in the vicinity of Walnut Street on June 6 prior to the fight. “I heard music that you could hear two streets away. I stopped my car. ... It was coming out of Tipico.” The councilor, who lives nearby, went inside to investigate, finding “wall-to-wall people.” With some difficulty, he found someone who spoke English and urged them to turn the music down, which they did. He came away with an impression of Tipico, which he described as very small, with room enough for five tables. “It looked worse than the worst bar I’ve been in,” he said. The next day he heard of the attack on Torres. “It was very upsetting,\" Moutsoulas said. \"... I called this meeting because I’m concerned about the safety of the neighborhood.” Prior to voting on the license, Moutsoulas said he told Duran that his restaurant was too small to allow for a band. “He said to me, ‘You’re not saying that because I’m Dominican?’ That got me very mad. I came from Greece myself. I know what it is to feel you don’t belong.” For that reason, he explained, he had made a special effort to guide Duran through the process -- “because I believed in him.” Subsequently, he said, “You have people in that apartment block across the street that have been calling me for six months about the noise.” In one case, he added, a person went to the building to complain, “and they got threatened.” “You got proof of that?” Duran demanded, a response that brought gasps from some. There was some doubt over whether the permit had already been issued. Duran said he had it, but City Clerk Tim Spanos said it hadn’t yet been paid for, thus it hadn’t been issued. Later, a frustrated Duran, who speaks English as a second language, was asked to respond to the criticisms of the council. “I feel like,” he began, but the words hung in the air and he was unable to finish.",

    "LabBody": "Tata Motors, which has been supplying vehicles to country’s off-road defence and security forces since 1958, said it received an order to supply 1,239 high-mobility 6x6 multi-axle trucks to the Indian Army. Valued at over Rs.900 crore, the order is the largest single order awarded to an Indian private sector equipment manufacturer under the defence procurement procedure of the Indian army. The order for 6x6 vehicles is for material handling cranes for loading, unloading and transportation of ammunition pallets, spares and other operational equipment. The product has been tested over two years in extreme conditions and also underwent maintainability trials for six months. “We decided to take a ‘deep dive’ into the segment and encompass the entire range of land force equipment. The first target was indigenisation and we targeted light combat vehicles,” Vernon Noronha, Vice-president – Defence \u0026 Government Business, Tata Motors, told a media round table. The company has done business totalling around Rs.2,000 crore with the Armed Forces in the last three years, and has an order book worth around Rs.1,500 crore over the next two years. It offers a wide range of defence vehicles in the light, medium and heavy category, also exporting them to SAARC, ASEAN and African regions. “While there were almost no orders for two years, a year after the new government has assumed office, files have been moving which has enthused the entire industry,’’ he said. Moving up the defence chain The company is now consciously moving from logistics and wheeled vehicles to combat vehicle as part of its strategy. “This is a complete departure from our mainline business with the use of completely different technology,” Mr. Noronha said. It has a mine protection vehicle (MPV) platform, and has supplied vehicles to the police force. It will be competing with other players for the contract to supply of 702 light armoured multi-role vehicles (LAMV) to the Indian Army. It would be over a three year period with each vehicle priced above Rs.1.5 crore. It will tie up with the government’s Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for the bid. Tata Motors is working on a Wheeled Infantry Combat Vehicle ‘Kestrel’ in collaboration with Defence Research \u0026 Development Organisation (DRDO). “We will supply three of these amphibious vehicles to test,” Mr. Noronha said adding that the tie-up would source technology from France, Germany, Switzerland and the U.S. and integrate it to ‘Make in India.’ The tie-up could move up into Light Tanks and Main battle tanks in some years,” he added.

    "DiffbotBody": "Same-sex couples will now be eligible for federal marriage benefits, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced Thursday. “I am proud to announce that the critical programs for veterans and elderly and disabled Americans, which previously could not give effect to the marriages of couples living in states that did not recognize those marriages, will now provide federal recognition for all marriages nationwide,” Lynch said in a statement. The Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 ruling last month that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and that all states must grant gay and lesbian couples marriage licenses. Before the ruling, 13 states did not recognize same-sex marriage. Many federal marriage benefits were available to same-sex couples after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal ban on gay marriage. Some benefits, though, including Social Security and veterans benefits for spouses, were still unavailable to these couples if they lived in states that did not recognize their marriages. “With the Supreme Court’s new ruling that the Constitution requires marriage equality, we have now taken the further step of ensuring that all federal benefits will be available equally to married couples in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories,” Lynch said. The Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs said they were still working to implement the ruling, with the Social Security Administration issuing a statement that same-sex couples should apply for benefits right away, if they believe they qualify. The VA said that it will be issuing new guidance shortly, but in the meantime it will temporarily wait to rule on claims that were not covered previous to the Supreme Court ruling. Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney for Gay \u0026 Lesbian Advocates \u0026 Defenders, a legal advocacy group, told AP that there are still questions to be resolved regarding the implementation of the ruling. Issues of couples needing to re-apply if they had already been denied benefits have been raised. \"With this terrific statement from the attorney general, the devil is in the details,\" Henry said. \"Marriage benefits are available to same-sex couples nationwide, and that's as it should be. I think that is what the Supreme Court ruling requires. But what does that mean?\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "We'd love to have a weekly date night, but who in the world is going to watch the kids? Yes, there will come a time when you will need a babysitter. It may seem hard to fathom (why would you ever leave your little angels?), but it's true. Perhaps it's a necessity like a doctor's appointment or the 2 p.m. matinee, but the fact remains — you need a babysitter. Read: How to spot a great babysitter Take a deep breath, and don't be terrified; there are ways to find your own personal Mary Poppins. Asking the right questions is key (as is knowing what some babysitters do when you're gone). Having this crucial intel can help you find someone who doesn't take advantage of the situation. In general, err on the side of caution; have a short phone interview or in-person conversation (with the kids there) to see how everyone gets along. It may seem old fashioned, but ask for references. Several online babysitting agencies make their applicants go through a background check; you could hire through one of these to know what your sitter's history is. Hiring someone who is CPR certified may also come in handy. Be sure to know if your sitter has a medical condition (like frequent seizures) that could possibly put your child in danger. It seems like a lot, but these are your kids we are talking about! If you are trusting someone with your children, you should know as much as you can about them in order to find a good fit for your family. Here are six things to keep an eye out for, but more importantly, how to find someone you'll feel completely comfortable leaving your kids with. 1. #Pooltime Social media can be a great asset for a babysitter (hello Pinterest), but it can also pull their attention away from watching your kids. How is your caretaker supposed to be taking care of your child if Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are more of a priority? Be candid about how your sitter uses social media. Ask to keep cell phones and other gadgets out of site while the kids are awake, and to not post photos of your children online without your permission. 2. Party at your place It can be unnerving enough having someone in your house to watch your kids, let alone their boyfriend, friends and siblings too. There's no way that your child will be first priority when your babysitter is focused on having a night in with friends. Don't be afraid to come off as controlling when you ask that no one is to come over while you are away. Your sitter may be wonderful, but there's no way of knowing that their friends are. Maybe asking a neighbor to keep an eye out for a potential party is a good option if you are feeling wary. 3. Extra toppings — on the house! Just because you've left some \"just in case\" cash on the counter doesn't give permission for a babysitting free for all; and having the parents gone doesn't mean rules go out the window. It's not unreasonable to ask a babysitter to put kids down at a regular bedtime, keep a schedule and have something other than ice cream and cake for dinner. Knowing exactly what amount of cash you've left behind and asking for receipts for purchased items can help avoid some financial mishaps. To make sure their night in goes as planned, leave a list out or a schedule to keep everyone on the same page. 4. \"But my dad says ... \" When parents are home, the little rug-rats know that they aren't the boss … but when a babysitter is over? Kids may think that things have changed. Even if your child knows that they aren't allowed to eat on the couch, does your sitter? It seems exhaustive, but making a list of house rules can help avoid some unnecessary drama when you come home. If your sitter knows what's to be expected, she can firmly answer \"No\" if kids try to bend the rules. 5. Tonight's season finale Yes, the kids may be sleeping, but it's still not a great time to catch the season finale of a not-so-PG TV show. It's hard to know who is watching from the top of the stairs, or learning a new \"vocabulary\" word or two while the season finale is streaming. As a parent, don't just toss out \"Use the TV and computer if you'd like\" offer, unless you mean it. Suggest that your sitter brings a book to read until you get home if you're not so sure what sort of thing your kids might be exposed to. 6. Negligence This can be kind of major (like forgetting to pick someone up from soccer practice) or a minor mishap (skipping important things like naps and snacks). Of course, negligence can be even more serious; signs of child abuse should be handled immediately … but hopefully these questions and getting a background check can prevent that from happening. Of course, you and your sitter should trust each other, but there may be times where your child can tell you more than your babysitter does. If your child seems to be excessively tired, hungry or generally unkempt when you return home, it's time to find a new sitter. If you do your research, you can avoid the worry that comes with having a babysitter over. Try having a little \"test run\" period, where you are only gone for 30 minutes or so, and then spend the rest of the afternoon talking with your sitter and playing with the kids. And don't forget to follow your gut; if you don't feel good about something, your motherly instinct is kicking in. But doing your research can help you find someone truly supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "Keurig coffeemakers have grown in popularity over the last few years. The ability to make a single cup of a particular flavor of coffee on demand has been a huge selling point for these appliances. As awesome as that sounds, the convenience of the Keurig comes with a price. Keurig Brewed Coffee Is More Expensive Than Traditional Methods. Keurig coffeemakers cost more money to purchase upfront and to operate over their life. Initially, a Keurig 2.0 K350 brewer retails for $149.99 while a typical brew coffeemaker can be purchased for less than twenty dollars. Making matters worse, Keurig machines are also more expensive when it comes to brewing coffee. If you buy a 60 K-Cup variety pack with a twenty percent off coupon at Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond, a single K-Cup will cost you $0.53. Compare that to the cost of a regular cup of coffee from your typical coffeemaker at approximately $0.08 per twelve-ounce cup, using Maxwell House ground coffee. Other brands of coffee will cost more, but should still be cheaper than the individual K-Cup price. When using a regular coffee maker, you must remember to purchase a pack of coffee filters occasionally. While these are inexpensive, they do add to the cost per cup of coffee over the long run. If you want to drink the cheapest overall coffee, you should opt for instant coffee, since there is no cost required to buy a coffeemaker. Simply add some instant coffee to hot water and you can have a twelve-ounce cup of coffee for as little as $0.07 per cup. For a little more outlay, ground beans can be put into a paper filter in a pour-over filter cone, and hot water poured over them for inexpensive fresh coffee. Keurig Still Cheaper Than Starbucks. While Keurig-brewed coffee costs more than traditionally brewed coffee, consumers still save a significant amount of money over the long run by using a Keurig brewer rather than buying a daily drink at Starbucks. You would save roughly $1.25 a day or $456 a year assuming you would forgo a daily $1.75 twelve-ounce cup of coffee from Starbucks and instead make a ten-ounce cup of coffee from your Keurig. After subtracting out the cost of the Keurig machine, you will still end up with hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket at the end of the first year. If you instead opt for the cheaper McDonald's twelve-ounce coffee, which costs just one dollar per cup, you will end up paying approximately $183 more per year than you would if you used a Keurig coffeemaker. While buying a Keurig coffeemaker would wipe out most of these savings during the first year, each additional year you continue to use the machine the savings would be yours to pocket. Keurig for the Office. While a Keurig coffeemaker may not be the most cost effective method to make coffee, they are a big hit with employees at the workplace. The K-Cup system allows employees to make their coffee of choice without making a big mess in the break room. Employers no longer have to worry about an employee leaving the coffee pot on overnight to return to a pot of extremely burnt coffee the next morning. Other concerns that disappear include someone making coffee weaker or stronger than you personally prefer or Bob from Accounting always taking the last cup of coffee and not making more. Instead, employees simply make their own preferred cup of coffee and dispose of used K-Cups in a trash can. While this may raise coffee costs in the office, the reduced headache may be worth the additional cost. Keurig Limits Their 2.0 Coffeemaker. When Keurig launched the latest 2.0 version of their coffeemaker, they added an additional feature that made many fans angry. The company designed their new coffeemaker only to accept licensed K-Cups that carry a special ink. Without the ink, third party K-Cups could not be used in the new coffeemaker, forcing consumers to buy the more expensive licensed K-Cups. Lucky for consumers and unfortunately for Keurig, you can work around the new ink-detecting system. The simplest solution is to simply take a licensed K-Cup, remove the portion of the label with the special ink, and tape it over the sensor. Whenever you brew a cup of coffee, the sensor will see the special ink, no matter which K-Cup you insert into the machine. This hack allows consumers to save money by buying third party K-Cups or by using refillable and reusable K-Cups. Keurig Caves and Brings Back the My K-Cup. The My K-Cup, a reusable cup that consumers could fill with their choice of coffee, was initially incompatible with the newly launched 2.0 version of their coffeemaker. After much outcry, Keurig caved to pressure and brought back the My K-Cup, which can greatly reduce the cost per cup of coffee when using a Keurig 2.0 machine. Buying a Keurig saves you money if you normally opt for coffee at McDonald's or Starbucks on a daily basis. However, if you normally brew your coffee at home or opt for instant coffee, a Keurig will increase your yearly coffee bill. With this knowledge, buying a Keurig should be an easy decision based on your current drinking habit. More from MoneyTips.com:",

    "DiffbotBody": "With Microsoft making significant layoffs in its phone business this week, it seems to outsiders like an uncharacteristic misstep. How did the tech giant misunderstand the mobile market so badly? As CEO Satya Nadella pulls the company away from unprofitable ventures launched by predecessor Steve Ballmer, it’s worth taking a look at some of the other major blunders that have hit the company. Did you know Microsoft made an MP3 player? Or that Windows Vista’s development was going so badly at one point that they hit the reset button? And that's just the beginning. Nokia With Nokia one of the few companies actually making Windows phones, Microsoft officials were a bit spooked that Nokia might switch platforms and move into the Android camp. Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analysis, explains that Microsoft paid a “strategy tax” by buying Nokia’s devices division in 2013 to make sure the hardware existed to run its software. “Why Microsoft paid over $7 billion for a money-losing business is mind-boggling, but what really hurt was the timing: Microsoft paid the strategy tax after Windows had already lost the mobile platform fight,” Greengart said. Tablet PC Nokia wasn’t the first time Microsoft pushed into the mobile sphere, nor was the iPad the first tablet computer. No, the snappily named Windows XP Tablet PC Edition helped define what Microsoft saw as the future of computing: computers that were more like books, except they had pens and you could touch the screens. The company had eight years between launching the tablet PC and the iPad arriving, and in that time hardware improved, laptops got lighter, and operating systems became more streamlined. None of that mattered in the end. Microsoft had fundamentally misunderstood how people would use tablets, and the iPad set the world alight from the word go. Zune Remember the Zune? If so, you’re one of the few who do. Five years after the iPod came out, Microsoft finally decided it had an answer to Apple’s runaway success. Available at launch in black, white and, er…brown, the Zune had some interesting features like Wi-Fi and a marginally bigger screen to set it apart from the iPod video. None of that mattered, and the launch of the iPhone a few months later did little to help. In 2009, three years after launching, it had a 2 percent share of the market according to NPD. The company finally pulled the plug in June 2012. Ad Tech In 2007, Microsoft decided it was time to jump into another industry it had waited far too long to join. And so it was advertising’s turn, an industry dominated in the online sphere by Google, with Microsoft buying aQuantive in 2007 to make its entry. In 2012, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion write-down on its ad tech investments. In 2013, the company sold Atlas Solutions, part of the aQuantive buyout, to Facebook. The Q4 2014 financial results showed display ads made up 15 percent of total ad revenue, and sure enough last month Microsoft finally pulled the plug. Windows Vista Vista started off life in May 2001 as “Longhorn,” named after a bar at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort. “Whistler” and “Blackcomb” were the codenames for Windows XP and 7, respectively, with “Longhorn” intended as a stopgap release for 2003. Over time, Blackcomb features made their way into Longhorn, and more and more ideas were thrown into the mix. At the same time, Microsoft was doubling down on security updates for XP, pulling resources from Longhorn. In August 2004 it was clear Microsoft had no idea what the plan was, so they started over. Vista finally launched in January 2007, more than five years after XP. It was the longest timespan between releases, cost $6 billion, and was replaced by Windows 7 in around half the time it took Vista to arrive. Windows 8 Unfortunately, the Windows success would soon slip away again. Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows division, was able to implement his vision of how Windows should be. It should work with touchscreen interfaces, kickstart a new app ecosystem and set out bold new ideas. Turns out, enterprise users don’t care about any of that stuff, and consumers don’t want touchscreen controls for their keyboard and mouse. Microsoft was disappointed by sales, and even today Windows 8.1 has a market share of 13.12 percent (compared to 60.98 percent for Windows 7), according to NetMarketshare. Sinofsky, CEO Steve Ballmer’s most likely successor, was eventually forced out in November 2012. Satya Nadella instead took over from Ballmer in 2014, and the rest is history.",

    "LabBody": "Less than a week after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence informed President Barack Obama that the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s impending rules to reduce carbon emissions from power plants were unacceptable, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against federal regulations which attempt to limit power plant emissions of hazardous air pollutants. Obama came into office threatening to do harm to the coal industry, even in his home state of Illinois. And now his EPA seems well on its way to reducing emissions from coal-burning power plants such as we have in the Tri-State. But earlier in the week, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 that the EPA failed to take costs into account when the agency first decided to regulate mercury and other toxic emissions from coal and oil fired plants. The EPA did write that the standards are expected to reduce mercury, a toxic chemical, by 90 percent, and the standards are expected to be fully in place next year. According to the Associated Press, the issue is whether health risks were the only factor studied under the Clean Air Act. Justice Antonin Scalia said it was not appropriate to impose billions of dollars of economic costs vs. dollars in health or environmental benefits. The case, brought by 21 states including Indiana and by energy groups, will now go back to lower courts so the EPA can decide how to account for costs. In the meantime, the EPA rules will remain in place. Meanwhile, and before the high court ever ruled, Gov. Pence sent the president a letter saying Indiana would reserve the right to use any legal means available to block the rule from being implemented. Pence said he was drawing a line in the sand. According to Indiana, the plan requires Indiana to reduce carbon emissions 20 percent by 2030. Pence believes that will increase electricity costs for Hoosiers and hurt economic growth. Still, it is obvious that something of a balance is needed, even though, according to the EPA, the benefits of cutting emissions include preventing up to 290 premature births and $2.4 billion in health benefits in 2016 — a factor that is difficult to argue with.",

    "LabBody": "The Republican-controlled state Assembly approved a two-year budget bill early Thursday morning, sending the $73 billion spending plan on to Gov. Scott Walker -- but not without some dissent. Eleven Republicans broke ranks and voted against the budget, which passed on a 52-46 vote with no support from Democrats. The GOP opposition came from rural districts, primarily in western Wisconsin, where transportation spending was a top concern. Rep. Lee Nerison of Westby, chairman of the Assembly agriculture committee, cited the lack of support for rural roads. “I am concerned that this vital economy will quickly erode if we don’t take care of our rural roads so we can get our goods to market,” Nerison said in a statement. “Rural areas need good roads just as much as Milwaukee does, and I’ll keep fighting to get our fair share.” Rep. Nancy VanderMeer, whose 70th District stretches nearly 90 miles from the La Crosse County border to north of Stevens Point, said the state needs to spend more on rural transportation while borrowing less money. “We have a lot of road surface in our district,” VanderMeer said. “I believe that … our transportation aspect is very vital to our rural areas and the expansion of future business and commerce.” The first-term Republican from Tomah said she would also have liked to see more spending on education but nevertheless was pleased that the budget did not cut Family Care and Senior Care, programs designed to keep the sick and elderly out of institutions. “There are a lot of very, very good things in this budget,” she said. Rep. Warren Petryk cited the $850 million in borrowing for transportation as his primary objection. “In my opinion our overall debt owed by the state continues to be much too high,” the Eleva Republican wrote. Petryk said he supported increasing the gas tax and registration fees to fund road construction. He also balked at full repeal of the prevailing wage law, which sets minimum pay for construction workers on public projects, and said he would have liked to see more support for education. The budget essentially keeps K-12 spending flat while expanding eligibility for private school vouchers, which divert money from public schools. It cuts the University of Wisconsin budget by $250 million. Education was also a key factor for Rep. Ed Brooks of Reedsburg, who said the budget that passed was an improvement over the one Walker introduced in February but felt it needed more. “I feel the emphasis on investing in statewide private school vouchers instead of expanding educational options within public education was misplaced,” Brooks said in a statement. “Also, we still need to find a better way to fund rural transportation.” Rep. Kathleen Bernier of Chippewa Falls objected to the UW cuts and transportation borrowing. She also said the prevailing wage law should have been debated on its own. “Voting for the ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ provision included in this budget was not the best option, in my opinion,” Bernier said. “I believe that this outdated law requires further education and discussion, both in the Legislature and in the public, without the pressure of a looming budget deadline.” Other Republicans voting no were James Edming of Glen Flora, Scott Krug of Nekoosa, Todd Novak of Dodgeville, Keith Ripp of Lodi, and Travis Tranel of Cuba City. Thirty-five Democrats voted against the budget, which many called “the worst” the state has seen. They objected to expansion of the voucher program and cuts to higher education among other concerns. Rep. Chris Danou, a Democrat from Trempealeau, did not cast a vote. A spokesman said he was unable to attend the vote because of a family matter.",

    "LabBody": "By MEGHAN PIERCEUnion Leader Correspondent. — For the first time in 50 years, the city is looking to create a new vision for the downtown, interim City Manager Paula Maville said Thursday.The last comprehensive review of downtown followed a fire in 1964. At that time, the city took the opportunity to reconfigure some streets, create a pedestrian mall and add a pedestrian tunnel under a railroad track, Maville said.“The downtown was kind of reestablished after we had a fire in 1964,” she said.The faltering railroad tunnel under the Hanover Street pedestrian mall is the reason downtown is being revisited, Maville said.City officials recently closed it to the public when it became a danger. In announcing the Downtown Lebanon Visioning Study and Tunnel Project Thursday, Maville said city officials have decided the fate of the tunnel should be studied as part of the downtown as a whole.The project was spurred by the notion that it should be a bigger conversation, Maville said, taking into consideration the current downtown as well as the possibilities for development.Being in the central business district, downtown zoning allows for intense density. And because the Mascoma River runs through the downtown, certain environmental considerations are required. The study will also include understanding the current business needs as well as the wants of new and future businesses and possible redevelopment of some existing structures.“We want to approach this with an extremely open mind, keeping in mind what are our possibilities,” she said. “We want a really open and comprehensive look at possibilities.”City officials plan to launch a large social media campaign to alert the public and get them involved as soon as the consultant contracts are finalized, Maville said.mpierce@newstote.com",

    "LabBody": "Dear Dr. Roach: Can exposure to infectious mononucleosis trigger or cause rheumatoid arthritis to flare up and become active? I would appreciate your comments. Thank you. – J.C. A: The Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis (although there are other germs that can cause a similar picture), has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and there is some evidence that EBV may be a trigger that causes RA and possibly other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, to become active in a person who is genetically susceptible. However, this evidence is only speculative at this point, since an alternative explanation for the association is that the immune deficiencies in RA and other autoimmune diseases allow for abnormal persistent replication of EBV. What is more important is that nearly all adults (90-95 percent) have had EBV infection, and re-exposure to the virus does not cause clinical infection and almost certainly will not trigger new onset or a flare-up of RA in people who already have been exposed to EBV. Shingles vaccination. Dear Dr. Roach: I have never had the shingles, nor even chickenpox. I couldn't find a record of it, even in my baby book. Do I need to have the shingles shot? I am over 70 and take several medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol. – C.S. A: I recommend the shingles vaccine to someone in your situation, despite the fact that the shingles vaccine isn't perfect. In the initial trial that got the vaccine approved, following almost 40,000 adults over 60, 3.3 percent who did not receive the vaccine got shingles in three years, and 1.6 percent of those who received the vaccine developed shingles. However, for the dreaded complication of post-herpetic neuralgia, having the vaccine reduced the risk from 0.6 percent to 0.2 percent in people over 70. Most people over 70 have had chickenpox. Sometimes the disease is so mild that it can go unrecognized. But both people who have and have not had chickenpox should get the vaccine. People with conditions weakening their immune system should not get the vaccine. The absolute benefits of 1.7 percent reduction in developing shingles, plus the 0.4 percent reduction in post-herpetic neuralgia are not very large. About 50 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one bad outcome in three years. Over a long time, however, the absolute benefit is likely to get more impressive. More importantly, the risk of the vaccine is small. The major adverse events have been headache and sore arm. In my opinion, the benefits far outweigh the risks, and by vaccinating a lot of people, some cases of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia can be prevented. Having seen how devastating post-herpetic neuralgia can be in an older person, I think it is worth it. Achilles tendinopathy. Dear Dr. Roach: In your recent column on Achilles tendinopathy, you discuss treatment, but please also make sure that the patient does not have a spondyloarthropathy. – Dr. Irene Blanco, M.D. A: The spondyloarthropathies are a group of related conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter's syndrome). These all increase the risk of Achilles tendinopathy, due to inflammation at the insertion of tendons to bone. Similarly, these conditions also increase the risk of plantar fasciitis. Achilles tendinopathy and recurrent plantar fasciitis should prompt your doctor to consider the possibility of one of the spondyloarthropathies. X-rays and blood tests help confirm the clinical diagnosis. I thank Dr. Blanco for writing. Dr. Keith Roach writes for North America Syndicate.

    "LabBody": "Finance Minister Michael Noonan did not object to Nama proceeding with the sale of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio, despite learning the process had run into controversy. Mr Noonan was informed in March of last year that a former Nama adviser stood to earn stg£5m in fees if one of the bidders, global investment management firm Pimco, was successful. Former banker Frank Cushnahan had been a member of Nama's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee until the previous November, when he resigned for \"personal reasons\". Nama decided to exclude Pimco from bidding after learning of Mr Cushnahan's involvement. Its chairman, Frank Daly, said Mr Noonan had been \"very concerned\" about the development and agreed with the decision taken by Nama. However, he told the Dail's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that the minister did not request that the entire sales process to be suspended. Nama subsequently sold the portfolio, known as 'Project Eagle' and comprising loans on 850 properties, to US private investment firm Cerberus for €1.6bn. The loans had once been valued at more than €5bn. As part of the deal, Cerberus used the same lawyers who had been engaged by Pimco, US firm Brown Rudnick and Belfast solicitors Tughans. The managing partner of Tughans, Ian Coulter, subsequently left the firm after an audit found fees of Stg£7m had been diverted to an account in the Isle of Man. Independent TD Mick Wallace claimed in the Dáil last week that the money had been reportedly earmarked for a Northern Ireland politician or party. Several members of the PAC, including chairman John McGuinness, Independent TD Shane Ross and Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald, said they believed the sale process should have been abandoned when Nama learned of the proposed payment to Cushnahan. Ms McDonald said the process was \"incestuous\", with \"the same actors, the same players\" involved. \"The whole thing stinks to the high heavens,\" she said. Mr Noonan defended Nama last night, saying he believed it had acted correctly at all times. \"There are certainly grounds for an inquiry, and in my view there are grounds for a police inquiry,\" he said. \"If actions are found to be improper or criminal, it was at the purchaser side, not at the seller side. Nama did everything possible and got best price for the Irish taxpayer. They had a fully competitive tender process and they sold to the highest bidder.\" His comments came as the PSNI confirmed the UK's top law enforcement body, the National Crime Agency, would be inquiring into allegations that money was set aside to make payments on the fringes of the sale. Earlier, the PAC heard that Pimco had been poised to pay Stg£15m in acquisition fees, with a third of these set to go to Mr Cushnahan. The remaining Stg£10m was to be paid to Tughans, via Mr Coulter, and Brown Rudnick, provided the bid proved successful. Mr Daly said that after receiving the information, Nama's board decided Pimco could no longer be a bidder as \"the proposed fee arrangement could undermine the integrity of the sales process\". He said it made this decision despite being satisfied Mr Cushnahan would not have had access to confidential information in relation to the loans portfolio. Independent TD Shane Ross described the disclosure of the proposed payment as \"shocking\". \"It's just another kind of pretty startling fact in this process that something very odd is going on,\" Mr Ross said. \"I would have thought that the sequence of events would make you guys say, 'look, this thing stinks.\" Mr McGuinness said he was \"deeply concerned\" about what had happened and questioned the judgment exercised by Nama. Responding to TDs, Mr Daly said: \"If we knew then what we know now, a lot of things would have worried us.\" The Nama chairman told the committee that it had not come under any pressure from politicians or anyone else over its decision to sell the loans. He also said that any alleged payments made to an account in the Isle of Man did not come from Nama and that it received the full value of the sale. Nama chief executive Brendan McDonagh defended the value for which the loans were sold. \"I believe that the commercial decision taken by the Nama board to dispose of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio was the right one,\" he told TDs. \"The board took the view that this option would provide the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers.\" Irish Independent.

Prolonged insurgency has affected the criminal justice system in North East with the rate of prosecution of criminals just five per cent in some states in the region as compared to the national figure of over 85 per cent, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said today \"...Now the time has come when apart from insurgency- centric security, we must think, plan and deliver on people-centric security,\" he told a security meeting of all north east Chief Ministers here. \"The people of the region have suffered the trauma of insurgency for long. Now they must reap the dividend of peace. Insurgency has adversely impacted the criminal justice system,\" he said. \"It has severely undermined common man's access to justice. In some N-E states, ratio of prosecution of criminals in cases of serious crimes is disturbingly low, as low as five per cent as against all-India figure of over 85 per cent. In cases of kidnapping for ransom, this data is negligible in NER,\" Singh said. However, there has been a marked increase in low-visibility yet high-impact violent crimes like kidnapping for ransom and extortions in Assam and Meghalaya, he noted. When aggrieved people do not get justice from states, not only does their confidence in the system gets eroded but they also become prone to alternative course for justice and it further vitiates the environment, he said. \"The state police must pay greater attention to registration and investigation of crimes and pursue the cases diligently in the courts for punishing the criminals, who commit heinous crimes in these states. The larger criminal justice system must deliver,\" Singh said. To bring back confidence in the rule of law, the Home Minister urged the Chief Ministers to pay attention to it in their respective states.",

Three days after the tragic event, his friend showed up, shot the creature in the head and dragged it to the water. When the wildlife officials cut open the alligator, they found some of Woodward’s remains inside its belly.

    "LabBody": "S ophie Kimery had no idea that the character Grizabella in the musical “Cats” is the one who sings the show’s signature song, “Memory.” “When I was told I had been cast as Grizabella, I started looking through the score,” Kimery said. “The first thing I came across was ‘Memory.’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute — I have to sing that?’ “And then everyone else started telling me, ‘No pressure, but that’s only the song that everyone in the world knows,’ ” Kimery said. “But we think she does it very well,” Morgan Powell added. Powell stands out from the group of people milling about backstage at the VanTrease PACE. It’s not simply because he’s the only one who isn’t decked out in leotards decorated with feline colors and patterns, elaborate face paint and stiff wigs combed into points that resemble a cat’s ears. It’s because Powell has more than a few years — and, in most instances, a foot or more in height — on all the people around him. Powell was one of the people who founded Youth Onstage, which is readying its production of “Cats” for a five-performance run this weekend in the VanTrease’s Studio Theater. And he’s continued as the organization’s president and producer, overseeing what he terms “this hand-to-mouth gypsy theater company” as it has gone about the business of putting young talent on Tulsa stages for the past 15 years. Those shows include large-cast musicals “9 to 5” and “Grease,” as well as straight plays such as a version of Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” set during the American Civil War. Youth Onstage is the first local theater group to mount its own production of “Cats,” the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that took a slim volume of verse about some anthropomorphized felines and turned it into one of the most successful shows in music theater history. “We started this group with the idea that the focus should be on the kids,” Powell said. “Usually, the emphasis is on ‘doing a great show.’ Of course you want that, and I think our kids do put on some great shows. “But we try to focus on the rehearsal process, and on making kids aware of how talented they are,” he said. “I believe that every child has talent — it’s just a matter of creating a place where that talent can blossom. And when you see that happening, it’s a marvelous thing.” That welcoming atmosphere — Powell said that every young performer who auditions is given a part — and the camaraderie that develops is something that the Youth Onstage participants value. “This company is really more like a family than any other group I know,” said Hannah Roley, who will be playing the cat Etcetera. “The understanding and patience people show here is really special.” Powell added: “We’re always having kids who have gone on to college come back to take part in the summer musicals. They’re not wanting to have the lead roles — they just want to be part of the chorus, to participate.” Two former Youth Onstage performers, Alanna Wood and Beth Cruice, have returned this summer to co-direct “Cats.” “This group made me more confident of myself, as a performer and as a person,” Wood said. Wood took part in her first Youth Onstage show in 2009, as a high school freshman. Cruice got involved with the group after moving to Tulsa from New Orleans about three years ago. “After last summer’s musical, I said to Morgan that I wanted us to do ‘Cats,’ ” Wood said. “I wasn’t thinking about what role I’d have, I just wanted us to do the show.” Wood’s background in dance led her to serving as the show’s choreographer, as well as sharing directing duties. “I’m more in charge of the technical side of things — the sets and lighting, that sort of thing — while Alanna deals with the costumes and the choreography,” Cruice said. “But there is also a lot of collaborating.” Wood will also be on stage, taking over the role of Rumpleteazer as that performer had to leave because of medical reasons. Although Cruice enjoys performing, she has discovered she prefers being on the other side of the limelight. “I love seeing the kids’ faces light up when they get a scene or a song or a dance right,” she said. “The hardest part of my job is, I think, the age differences in the cast. Our cast goes from ages 6 to 22, and you can’t explain things to a 6-year-old the way you can to a 22-year-old.” Wood oversaw the costumes for the show, but she also made sure the performers had a part in that creative process. “I would tell them the color scheme I wanted and kind of pattern each character should have, but I left the painting of the costumes up to the individual actor,” she said. “That way, they’re even more involved in the show. It’s not just learning lines and songs.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "It is a natural reaction for us to punish ourselves when we are suffering from heartache. Here's why that's a bad idea, and what to do instead. Emotional pain can be worse than physical pain. When we feel physical pain, we can do something about it; we clean the wound, put on some sterile dressing and give it some time to heal. Whether it is a muscle cramp, a broken bone or a laceration, there is a remedy that will facilitate the healing process. Heartache is different The pain of heartache stings to our very soul. Our hopes and dreams have been dashed to pieces. Like Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall, all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put him back together again. When our heart breaks, it feels as if we have lost a part of ourselves. Read: 10 ways you are ruining your own happiness Our first response is to blame, criticize or condemn. First, we turn against the person who is gone. When we realize that doesn't solve the problem, we turn on ourselves. We argue that we deserve it, for surely we are not good enough! We feel vulnerable and find ourselves susceptible to every look and comment. In order to mask the vulnerability, we adopt self-defeating behaviors. We sleep in, overeat, withhold positive self-talk and make ourselves do things that are difficult, scary or cruel. We think that if we inflict enough emotional pain on ourselves, either we will feel better or perhaps someone will come to our rescue. They will feel sorry for us, bind up our wounds and give us the love that we desperately need. Unfortunately, these types of relationships don't solve heartaches; they create more of them! Healing is possible \"One day while I was lying in bed, nursing my heartache and waiting for the world to end, I heard a knock above my head. I looked up, but there was nothing on the headboard that could have fallen to make the sound. I knew it was God. He was telling me, 'Get up! Stop moping around and do something!'\" Although time may assuage the pain, a heartache does not heal itself. The heart is the very center of the soul; it is the connecting link between the spirit and the body. The person we love becomes a part of us. When they leave, we feel a deep sense of loss, and the pain may seem unbearable. The only way to fill the hole left by a heartache is to turn to God. This requires that we become humble, willing, obedient and serve others. Humility The pain of heartache brings us to our knees. We realize our dependence upon God, and acknowledge that we cannot overcome this difficulty on our own. We need Him to help us. We give Him our burden of weakness and imperfection, and express our desire to be healed. Willingness We accept our imperfect state, and open our minds and hearts to God's healing power. We give all that we have to Him in exchange for His unconditional love. Our souls are bathed with the peace \"which passeth all understanding\" Philippians 4:7. Obedience We truly can feel whole and complete once again. The bitterness of the heartache will subside. We can show our gratitude to God by taking His hand and walking with Him, knowing that no matter what happens, He is there for us. Service As we serve others, our feelings of love for them will increase and we will desire to help those that are in pain. Finding ways to give helps fill the emptiness that our heartache left behind. We will feel a renewed sense of purpose, joy and happiness in life. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Heartaches are not the end of the world if we don't allow them to be. They are simply one more way for us to become closer to God. As we do so, we find that there are many others who walk similar paths, and that our experience can be used to help them.",

    "LabBody": "Attorneys representing several teenagers involved in a recent Craig Ranch pool party incident have vowed not to rest until former McKinney Police Cpl. David Eric Casebolt is arrested, tried and convicted of assault and battery. First, though, Atlanta civil attorney Kwame Thompson and his co-counsel, Houston criminal defense attorney Darrell Jordan, will file an administrative grievance with the McKinney Police Department against Casebolt for officer misconduct. The attorneys are representing the families of Jahda and Dajah Bakari, Jordan and Jayden Gray, Ladariene McKever and Maxwell Hudson. The attorneys spoke about their intentions at a press conference Friday in front of McKinney PD headquarters. Casebolt resigned June 9 amid an internal investigation into his actions responding to the pool party four days prior. A 7-minute video that quickly went viral shows Casebolt throw 15-year-old Dajerria Becton to the ground and pull his gun on two other party attendees who surrounded him during the incident. In the video, Casebolt also appears to push other teenage girls, including 13-year-old Jahda Bakari, as he attempts to restrain Becton. Pending an investigation into the incident, the attorneys said they also will likely file criminal charges against a resident seen in the video trying to help Casebolt restrain party attendees. Thompson claims that all of their clients are Craig Ranch residents and “had every right to be at the swimming pool that day.” Neighbors have said over 100 people showed up to the party, many who didn’t live there and weren’t allowed to be there under Craig Ranch homeowners association regulations. Jordan said that “everything is fluid” right now, as he and Thompson “don’t even know everybody’s names,” but that legally they must move forward with charges. “We have to act now to preserve our right to sue and to seek justice for our clients,” he said. “We can’t wait until everything is known.” The attorneys met with a McKinney PD representative as well as a Collin County criminal prosecutor and the Texas Rangers, whom the Collin County District Attorney’s office requested conduct an internal investigation into the incident. “I have full confidence in the good men and women of the McKinney Police Department and their ability to fully investigate this matter,” Collin County DA Greg Willis said in a released statement. “At the same time, an independent investigation of this incident will add an important layer of transparency to the process.” Thompson said the teenage clients, whose family members and friends were at Friday’s press conference, were “traumatized” by Casebolt’s actions. He and Jordan repeatedly referred to their clients as children, with Thompson calling them the “most vulnerable members of our society.” Jahda Bakari, the youngest of the six, is 13-years-old. “Those members of law enforcement as well as private citizens who have brought harm to our youth must be held accountable for their actions,” Thompson said. “Violence against children is unacceptable.” There are no current plans to file a civil lawsuit, he added. When asked about potential monetary damages the case might bring, Jordan insisted that wasn’t the main goal. “What’s most important to us right now and most important to these families is that Mr. Casebolt is never, ever allowed to carry a weapon again and claim to stand and protect others. He has demonstrated that he is not worthy,” he said. “If there’s some monetary damages that come on the back end, that’s great; we’ll take that too. But that’s not our primary purpose.” The attorneys are having the viral video enhanced so they can “see exactly what was going on to see who was touched and who wasn’t touched,” Jordan said. They and their clients are set to talk with investigators about the incident next week. Stay tuned for continued coverage of this situation. For local news updates, follow Chris Beattie on Twitter.",

And now here is the rest of the story: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was no cost to the American taxpayer until it is. Now the American taxpayer is on the hook for billions of dollars in loans, and the Congressmen know they are exposing us to billions of dollars in loans should these loans go bad. They also stated that the bank levels the playing field for whom? The losers are the United States consumer and other U.S.-based companies competing against these foreign companies that are receiving help. They are stating that reauthorization is essential to our economy and reforms are needed to ensure the bank's solvency, but did they tell you that reforms were included in the 2012 re-authorization bill that was passed by the House and the Senate and those reforms were largely ignored? And cronyism will still occur since it is a bureaucracy that taps into an unlimited line of credit called the American taxpayer. Please call the local offices of Bustos and Davis and tell them to vote “no” for the re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank. Let your voice be heard.

    "LabBody": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Caught between kids and aging parents, the sandwich generation worries more than most Americans their age about how they'll afford their own care as they grow older, a new poll shows. But most aren't doing much to get ready. Nearly 1 in 10 people age 40 and over are \"sandwiched\" — they're supporting a child while providing regular care for an older loved one, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Another 8 percent may join the ranks of double-caregivers in the next five years, citing declining health of an older relative or close friend. Dueling responsibilities can make some days feel like a tug-of-war. \"If my mom needs something badly, I get pulled away from my kids a lot,\" said Kamila Al-Najjar of Santa Rosa, California, a lawyer with two children and self-described health advocate for her mother. She visits her mother's assisted living facility at least twice a week and checks in daily by phone, to oversee a list of illnesses. \"You're dealing with someone who is aging, toward the end of their life; then you have to deal with a teenager. I hear from my mom and daughter that I'm a nag. There's no winning in it,\" she said. Adding to the challenge, 40- and 50-somethings tend to be at the height of their careers — and need to hang onto their jobs despite difficulties of caregiving, said Susan Reinhard, who directs AARP's Public Policy Institute. Employer flexibility is a top issue as the population ages, she said. \"It's not just their own financial security, it's the financial security for their children and for the future,\" Reinhard said. After age 65, government figures show nearly 7 in 10 Americans at some point will need long-term care — from a relative, home aide, assisted living or nursing home. Yet the AP-NORC Center poll found overall, most Americans 40 and older — 54 percent — have done little or no planning to get ready for this often pricey reality. Only a third reports setting aside money for those needs. That's even though Medicare doesn't pay for the most common types of long-term care, and a nursing home can cost more than $90,000 a year. Drill down to the 9 percent of this age group who make up the sandwich generation, and their experience leaves them far more concerned about their own senior years. About half worry about being able to pay for their future care needs or having to move into a nursing home, compared with just over a third of other adults, the poll found. Also, 44 percent of sandwichers fear leaving debts to family, compared with 28 percent of others polled. But the poll found the sandwich generation no more likely than other middle-aged adults to be planning and saving, possibly because of time or resources. Al-Najjar is glad her mother \"saved all her life ... so she didn't have to stress out about stuff like that.\" Caring for her has changed how she spends and plans for the future. \"It's like a wake-up call,\" she said. There are \"a lot of seniors in the United States that don't have that money.\" The squeeze isn't ending as children grow up. Among currently sandwiched parents, 29 percent have adult children living at home, the poll found; others are providing adult children with financial assistance, meaning some are sandwiched even after their children leave the nest. Another challenge: Finding services to help seniors live out their days at home. AARP recently opened an online \"livability index\" to rank communities on such factors as accessible housing and transit options. And the National Association for Area Agencies on Aging runs an Eldercare Locator — at www.eldercare.gov and 1-800-677-1116 — to help people find local resources. Last year, the locator averaged more than 22,000 requests for assistance a month. A recent report found the top needs: Transportation, mostly to get to doctor appointments; in-home services, such as meals and personal care; and finding affordable housing or making age-friendly home modifications. \"People don't generally make these calls until they're in crisis,\" said association CEO Sandy Markwood. \"If mom and dad need this as they get older, you should prepare for that, too.\" Carroll Burnett of Whitesboro, Texas, cared for his 88-year-old father, who'd suffered a stroke, for a year before he died in March. \"I felt good that I could take care of him,\" said Burnett, a retired tool and die maker who had help from his wife and one of his three grown children. But he's saving up: \"I don't want any of my kids to go through what I did.\" The AP-NORC Center survey was conducted by telephone April 7 to May 15 among a random national sample of 1,735 adults age 40 or older, with funding from the SCAN Foundation. Results for the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. • Check us out and like Yourwestvalley.com on Facebook and YourWVNews on Twitter.",

    "DiffbotBody": "At the end of June, the Greek government instituted capital controls — limits on how much money can be drawn from banks — after negotiations with the eurozone broke down and the country's fiscal and monetary lifelines disappeared. Two weeks in, Greek economic life is seizing up. In fact, Mashable is reporting that more and more Greeks can't even pay the cost of a funeral. \"People can't afford buying the graves,\" one local funeral business told the outlet, noting sales had dropped more than half since the capital controls began. \"They just bury the bodies and that's it.\" Greece is facing shortages of drugs and medical supplies, while shipments of perishable items rot on Greek docks because businesses literally can't afford to come pick them up. The country's larger corporations have foreign accounts that aren't covered by the capital controls. But smaller businesses, like everyday Greeks, are watching their ability to buy, sell, or really do any trading of any sort run dry. The economy is essentially dying from the bottom up. What buying is still going on is arguably a panicked binge by the upper class before even their funds run dry. Although the Greek government appears poised to accede to European demands on Sunday, the country's economic collapse is already worse than America's Great Depression. Jeff Spross",

The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "LabBody": "The first official 90-man roster that the Minnesota Vikings released featured a total of 18 defensive backs. There is naturally crossover between secondary roles, but the role-specific, compartmentalized listing featured eight outside cornerbacks, three slot cornerbacks, three free safeties and four strong safeties. This group of 18 defensive backs has slowly diminished since the early offseason cast of coverage specialists was put together following the NFL draft. Ahmad Dixon, a journeyman practice squad player, was the first one to fall, cutting the free safety group down to incumbent starter Harrison Smith and veteran role player Andrew Sendejo. In a bit of a surprise move, consensus bust and a former Mike Zimmer pupil with the Cincinnati Bengals Taylor Mays was the next to get a red tag in his locker. Mays wasn’t considered a roster lock by any means when he signed with the Vikings on March 24, but most assumed he would be present at training camp due to the $25,000 of guaranteed money included in his contract. Following a pair of organizational decisions to whittle the defensive back core down to 16, Minnesota received its first unplanned roster change in the form of a potentially significant pectoral injury to cornerback Josh Robinson. It hasn’t been a very good past couple of weeks for Robinson, who contributed 472 coverage snaps to the Vikings defense in 2014, the fifth-most among Minnesota defensive backs. Prior to news of his injury reaching the general public, Robinson made his religion-based, generally unpopular stance on gay marriage known during a lengthy Twitter rant in which he compared homosexuality to pedophilia. He then apologized a few days later. With exception to a pair of terrible game-long performances in coverage against Brandon Marshall and the Chicago Bears, Robinson was solid for the Vikings in 2014. This, however, doesn’t mean he isn’t replaceable; a strong argument could have been made that he wasn’t worthy of a 53-man roster spot even if he had remained healthy. General manager Rick Spielman and Co. did an excellent job bringing in secondary talent this offseason. From the mid-January signing of Canadian Football League standout Jalil Carter to the selection of Michigan State’s Trae Waynes with their No. 11 overall pick, the Vikings added a very promising group of young defensive backs this offseason. Now that Robinson is most likely headed for the physically unable to perform list and won’t factor into 53-man roster decisions for an indefinite amount of time, the likelihood of a bubble player landing a spot on Minnesota’s depth chart is more realistic. Of the 15 remaining defensive backs, only cornerback Xavier Rhodes and free safety Harrison Smith have carved out roles on Minnesota’s defensive back depth chart. Both players were worthy Pro Bowl candidates in 2014, and they will be significant pieces to a 2015 Vikings secondary that has the potential to head a top-ten defense. Aside from Rhodes and Smith, however, virtually every other defensive back role is up for grabs. Not even Captain Munnerlyn, who is guaranteed north of $1.5 million this season regardless of what could happens in August, is a lock to be a Week 1 starter against the San Francisco 49ers. Robinson’s size limitations (5’9”, 225 lbs), complete lack of ability to move inside in slot coverage and Zimmer’s statement regarding size requirements for cornerbacks in his defensive scheme made his 53-man roster status questionable. “You can write it down,” Zimmer stated during a post-draft press conference. “We’re not going to take any 5’9” corners here. Rick (Spielman) and I have talked about that many times, because I like big guys.” Coincidentally, Robinson (and Munnerlyn for that matter) stand at the exact height Zimmer deemed unfit for his cornerback depth chart. Robinson’s injury may have knocked the incumbent No. 3 cornerback out of consideration, but don’t expect Zimmer to lose much sleep with Waynes and, a player he’s noted as one of his favorites to coach, 36-year-old Terence Newman jockeying for playing time. Given the steep learning curve for a cornerback in Zimmer’s scheme, Newman is likely the favorite to win the No. 2 cornerback spot opposite of Rhodes to begin the season. Assuming this to be fact, there will still be a wide-open spot at nickel cornerback, the role Robinson was assigned to in 2014. Due to being a first-round pick and Zimmer’s history of throwing his top rookies directly into the fire (Anthony Barr in 2014, Dre Kirkpatrick—unsuccessfully—in 2012 with the Bengals), Waynes should be considered the favorite to be penciled in at this role. However, there are multiple other worthy outside cornerback candidates that will fight hard to outshine Minnesota’s top pick. Carter, a four-year starter at Akron from 2007-10, became one of the CFL’s top defensive backs in recent years. At 6’1”, 205 pounds, he has the size and length that Zimmer desires in his cornerbacks, but he remains a relative unknown due to playing against CFL-level competition from 2012-14. Aside from Carter, the only other defensive back with a theoretical shot of unseating Waynes is former University of Miami standout DeMarcus Van Dyke and his world-class speed. Possessing 4.28-second 40-yard dash time (recorded at 2011 NFL Scouting Combine) and a slender 6’1”, 187-pound frame, Van Dyke has the look of a 53-man roster shoe-in, especially following Robinson’s injury. Still, there is a reason he was released following his rookie season after being a third-round pick by the Oakland Raiders and has since bounced around to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs before finding a potential home in Minnesota. His basic cornerbacking and coverage skills lack refinement, and his general feel and understanding for his position are subpar. But, he talent is impressive and Zimmer has a history of getting the most out of his defensive backs (Mays being the one glaring exception), so it would be unwise to chalk him up as a roster cut too early. In the cases of fifth-year cover man Shaun Prater and “cornerback” Marcus Sherels, however, it would appear they are currently playing on borrowed time. Sherels, who was in for all of eight coverage snaps for Zimmer in 2014 after playing 368 under Leslie Frazier the year prior, doesn’t have a future in the NFL as a defensive back. With wide receivers Cordarrelle Patterson, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs all representing strong candidates to replace him as the team’s primary punt return man, it looks like Sherels’ time has finally run out in Minnesota. However, the former University of Minnesota Golden Gopher has looked the part of a guaranteed cut during the past two Vikings training camps, and he is still here. As for the slot cornerback position, Munnerlyn is set to enter training camp as the favorite to win the job. He struggled consistently playing on the outside in 2014, but he flashed the Carolina Panthers version of himself on multiple occasions in slot coverage. Second-year slot corner and 2014 seventh-round pick Jabari Price will challenge, but it would take a major upset to knock Munnerlyn out of this role (and off the roster completely). Potentially the most interesting of all the fresh faces at cornerback is the second defensive back who will attempt to run Munnerlyn from the top of the slot depth chart, former Tennessee ball hawk and undrafted free-agent signing Justin Coleman. Coleman, who was forced to miss valuable on-field time early on while recovering from shoulder surgery, was termed a “smart, quick reactor” by Minnesota’s head coach and defensive back whisperer. Although he is best suited to cover the slot, he may be the player who benefits most from Robinson’s injury; don’t be shocked if he uses his excellent athleticism and textbook intangibles to force himself onto the 53-man roster. The only spot left to cover is potentially the most intriguing of all: strong safety. Smtih, technically speaking, isn’t solely a free safety, as he is moved around all over the field; so it’s probably best to coin this up-for-grabs role as “the safety spot opposite Smith.” Robert Blanton is the incumbent, but Spielman and Zimmer had very little to say about him this offseason, electing to gush over former Virginia Tech coverage specialist Antone Exum instead. “Exum from last year, who made the conversion from corner to safety, ” Spielman responded during a post-draft press conference. “We’re very excited about the progress he has made.” If the season opened today, Blanton would almost assuredly take the field with the starting 11, but that is what training camp is for. Exum, who may quietly have the inside track on the vacant safety spot, isn’t the only realistic threat to Blanton, however. Anthony Harris, an undrafted safety hailing from the University of Virginia, has the perfect coverage skill set and ideal intelligence to become a long-term NFL starter. He made it very clear that he chose to sign with the Vikings because of the potential to come in and play, while also citing Zimmer’s gift for tutoring defensive backs. It will be a three-horse race for the safety spot opposite Smith, and could potentially add a fourth if Sendejo can get into a rhythm early, and leaving Harris out of the conversation because he wasn’t drafted is a mistake. “He’s very instinctive,” Zimmer said when asked about Harris. “Smart; very, very smart, very communicative safety. I think he plays really hard. He has a lot of traits of the starting safeties in this league.” (Robert Reidell is a Bismarck Tribune sportswriter)",

    "LabBody": "CASSOPOLIS — A White Pigeon man with an \"incredibly extensive\" criminal record is going back to prison, this time for meth-related offenses. Joseph James Chandler, 41, pleaded guilty to manufacture of methamphetamine, operating a meth lab and possession of meth — all as a habitual offender — and was sentenced Friday to concurrent prison terms of six to 30 years. He has credit for 35 days already served and must pay $1,334 in fines and costs. The incident occurred over three years ago in April 2012 at a residence in Porter Township when police found him operating a meth lab and in possession of meth. The prosecution ended up being delayed until now because he had convictions in between in St. Joseph County, Mich., for fleeing police and possession of meth. \"Your past criminal record is incredibly extensive,\" said Cass Circuit Judge Michael Dodge, who cited Chandler's 12 felony and 15 misdemeanor convictions as well as having been jailed 16 times. In another prison sentence, a Niles man is going to prison for violating his probation from a December 2013 assault with a dangerous weapon conviction. Jeremy Grierson, 29, pleaded guilty to violating his probation by moving out of the area without permission and was sentenced to a prison term of 18 months to four years. He has credit for 339 days already served and his probation was revoked. An Edwardsburg man who stabbed his friend in the back with a pocketknife during an argument will spend the next year in jail. Clinton James Majors, 45, pleaded guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to 365 days in jail with credit for 54 days already served and must pay $1,048 in fines and costs. He can be released after serving 10 months if he pays all his court assessments. The incident occurred May 18 at a residence in Edwardsburg. The victim, Reginald Warren, hit Majors in the head with an ax handle before being stabbed. In a letter to the court, Warren said that he still considers Majors a friend and has forgiven him. Judge Dodge noted that both Majors and Warren were drinking at the time when they got in an argument. \"With four felony and four misdemeanor convictions, you're not a suitable candidate for probation,\" he said.",

    "LabBody": "BOYS LACROSSE. Glenn Foster, Ipswich. In his 31 years coaching Ipswich high school boys lacrosse, this season may have been the most gratifying for Glenn Foster. A strong program with a long tradition, Ipswich and Foster had struggled through tough times over the last seven or eight years. The Tigers hadn’t even qualified for the postseason since 2009 before this spring, but Foster guided a strong group of seniors and a talented crew of underclassmen to a long tournament run. Ipswich went 9-0 in the Cape Ann League and won the Baker Division. The Tigers finished the regular season with a 13-1 record and earned the No. 1 seed in Division 3 North. The Tigers defeated North Reading (15-3), Lynnfield (9-8) and Pentucket (16-11) to capture the North championship. Their journey ended short of a state championship, losing to Grafton (10-9 in 2 OT) in the state semifinals, but that didn’t diminish the team’s season-long performance. “They were the ultimate team. Everyone had a say in the outcome,” Foster said. “They did something so very special and they enjoyed every moment of it.” Foster a 60-year-old teacher at Ipswich also wished to thank his assistant coach, Peter Ginolfi. GIRLS LACROSSE. Kerri O’Connor, Ipswich. Kerri O’Connor’s first year at the helm of the Ipswich girls lacrosse program didn’t necessarily get off to a great start. Forced inside for most of the preseason due to extended winter weather, O’Connor was a little bit behind in preparing for her first season. Ipswich dropped the first two games to find itself in an early hole. Things turned around very quickly under O’Connor, however. A five-game win streak turned the season around. The Tigers ended up 9-5 overall in the regular season and 7-2 in the Cape Ann League, which earned them the Baker Division title. The team’s play continued to trend upward into the postseason, where Ipswich defeated Shawsheen (16-7), Bishop Fenwick (13-7), Marblehead (12-8) and Austin Prep (13-10) to win Division 2 North. Ipswich’s season came to an end in a 10-9 double-overtime loss to Groton-Dunstable in the state semifinals. “Our goal this season as to be unified on a personal level and as a unified threat on the field. We did amazing at reaching this goal,” O’Connor, a physical education teacher at Covenant Christian Academy, said. “Leadership was strong and the girls had heart. They played clean and classy every game but fought hard to each game’s end.” Before taking over as head coach this season, O’Connor was the junior varsity coach the last two seasons. She credited the team’s captains and the assistant coaches — Kevin Lombard and Nicole Linehan — for the success. SOFTbALL. Johnny Gold, Marblehead The Magicians turned heads in the Northeastern Conference this spring as the young club picked up its first conference crown since 2007 and put together the most wins in a program history with 17. Gold, who’s been coaching for the past 14 years and specifically Marblehead softball for the last 10, led the talented group of players with procession and instilled confidence in the girls. Gold along with assistant coach Todd Norman, helped Marblehead develop into one of the most talented teams that’s ever come through the program. “This team was so hard working. They were focused and a had excellent comradery,” noted Gold. “I’m really proud of them because they’re a young group. I knew we had something going when we started winning on the road.” Marblehead put together a six-game win streak midway through the season, which helped clinch the NEC title. The Magicians defeated league rivals, Danvers and Swampscott during the regular season. They also won their first playoff game since 2011 by defeating Newburyport in the Division 2 North first round. Gold, who lives in Swampscott, is works in the solid waste and recycling industry. BASEBALL. Dan Letarte, St. John’s Prep. Competing at the highest levels requires an attention to detail that was never lost on Dan Letarte, who could frequently be found at his team’s next schedule ball park the day before a game walking the outfield and looking for small details that could help the Eagles. Letarte helped the Prep to one of its best seasons in 2015, as the team finished runner-up in the second Super 8 tournament with an overall record of 22-4, which ties a school record for wins set in 2013. In addition, the Prep won its third straight Catholic Conference championship (a first in program history) and became the first team in 15 years to go undefeated in CC play. “There’s nothing he wouldn’t do for us as players if he thought it would help,” senior Justin Foley said of his coach. With two years as head baseball coach, Letarte has a 39-9 overall record. He’s led the team to two Super 8 berths, and helped the Eagles rebound in this year’s tournament to force a winner-take-all final game against champion Braintree. A physical education teacher at St. John’s, Letarte was head basketball coach at the Prep from 1996-2008 as well. A graduate of Salem State, he lives in Peabody with his sons Sean and Ryan. “We had a really great group of kids this year,” Letarte said. “I’m really proud of our seniors and especially that they’re all going on to college.” BOYS TENNIS. Elisabeth Foukal, Marblehead. Expectations are always high when it comes to tennis in Marblehead. Under Elisabeth Foukal’s guidance, her MHS boys tennis team hasn’t disappointed. For the second straight spring, the Magicians finished the regular season a perfect 14-0 in Northeastern Conference play and won the NEC’s Small championship crown. Beefing up their schedule against non-league foes, the Magicians went 16-6 overall. Having finished her eighth season as the Marblehead boys coach, Foukal’s teams have averaged nearly 15 wins a season over the last four years. in each of her eight seasons on the job, the Nahant native has led the Magicians to the NEC title, either outright or shared. “The boys were really great this season,” said Foukal, who previously was a volunteer assistant in Swampscott for two seasons. “We had seven seniors on the varsity, including three four-year players in our three singles spots. The players make my job so enjoyable; they’re smart, great kids who are also really good tennis players.” Foukal, who adheres to the United States Tennis Association’s suggestion of having a no-cut policy, carried 36 players in the program this season. She thanked her junior varsity coach, Sharon Solomon, for all the work she puts into the program and its players. “Sharon’s a huge part of everything we do,” said Foukal. An economics major at Barnard College (a private women’s liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University) and former CEO of a small high-tech company, Foukal is the mother of three tennis-playing children. She said she loves “passing along the sport I love to another generation” through coaching at MHS. GIRLS TENNIS. Cathy Castoldi, Marblehead. Don’t mistake this as a case of beginner’s luck. First-year coach Cathy Castoldi did exactly what she hoped to do with her Marblehead girls tennis squad this spring: guided them to the Northeastern Conference title (sharing it with Swampscott) and into the quarterfinals of the Division 2 North state tournament. In doing so, she led the Magicians to a 15-1 record in league play and an area-best 18-4 mark overall. “We hit the goals we set for ourselves,” said Castoldi, who played tennis in college. “We wanted to have a respectable season, but we also set high standards and the girls were very focused the entire season.” A Special Education teacher in the ninth grade at Marblehead High for the last 10 years, Castoldi is also an advisor for the National Honor Society and Student Council. When she heard Tim Stonecipher had stepped down from his post last year, she approached athletic director Mark Tarmey about taking over despite having no prior experience. “Tennis was a family lifestyle when I was growing up; my parents both played, my sisters and I played,” said Castoldi. “So although I had never coached, I’ve always played and been around the game and was comfortable taking over.” Castoldi, who previously worked in the corporate world of medical marketing for 25 years, has two children, Pete and Stephanie, who recently graduated college. BOYS TRACK. Ray Carey, St. John’s Prep. After 39 years and 109 seasons between cross country, indoor and outdoor track programs, Ray Carey is retiring as the legendary St. John’s Prep track and field coach. Through the years Carey has coached many talented athletes who went on to have outstanding college careers. Still, none of them had ever reached the heights that Prep senior Joe Luongo did on the national stage this spring. “Joe is a special kid, and to coach him the last couple of years has been very rewarding,” said Carey, who lives in Marblehead. “I feel confident I’m leaving the program in good hands. A couple of younger people, Zach Lankow and Tim McAuliffe joined our staff and getting to work with them was special. Others like John Boyle, Bill Boyle, John Klein and Dana Smith have been with me for over 30 years and will stay on.” Carey went out on top as the Eagles won the Catholic Conference with a perfect record, took the league championship meet, and finished fourth at Division 1 states. Some Eagles went on to perform well at All-States and New Englands with Luongo (the Salem News Runner of the Year) placing 11th at New Balance Nationals in a personal best time in the 800. GIRLS TRACK. Dave Jellerson, Beverly. Dave Jellerson has been at the Panthers’ outdoor track helm for the past 26 years, accumulating an amazing 179-33 overall record. This spring, it was thought by some that the Panthers wouldn’t be as strong since they graduated 13 outstanding seniors from the previous year. But Jellerson’s squad never missed a beat; the younger kids picked up the slack to help Beverly achieve another unbeaten season in the Northeastern Conference, winning both the regular season and league championships. “This was a pretty exciting season,” said Jellerson. “We had a lot of holes to fill, (but) this group had such great enthusiasm and great team unity. That put us over the top. Our seniors provided leadership, our sophomore class really stepped it up, and we had five or six very good freshmen who started to get it early on. All four classes helped to make this a very enjoyable season. “What makes my job even more enjoyable is that over the years we’ve had not only great athletes, but good people, too. They work so hard and want to keep getting better. That makes practices and meets fun to coach.”",

    "LabBody": "Doha Bank, which commenced its India operations in April 2015, has identified Tier-II Indian cities and cheap loans as two of the main vehicles for scaling up its operations in the country. The bank is wooing small entrepreneurs with competitive lending rates. R. Seetharaman, Chief Executive Officer, Doha Bank, said that Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala and West Bengal were States under the bank’s scanner. The bank now has two branches in Mumbai and one in Kochi. These branches came into the fold through the acquisition of HSBC Oman. “We will like to relocate the Mumbai branch to another State,” he said at a media interaction. The bank will set up a full-fledged subsidiary within a few years, and the branch expansion will follow. Doha Bank, which has global footprints in 12 countries through a mix of full-fledged branches and representative offices, “wants to enhance operations in India” Mr. Seetharaman said. “States such as West Bengal are grossly under-banked,” he observed. ``Small and micro enterprises could borrow cheaply from the Doha Bank, which offers rates in the band of 6 to 9 per cent for the SME sector,’’ he added. It currently has an exposure of around $ two billion in India, which it plans to increase to $5 billion. The session was held under the aegis of the Bengal Chamber. The Chamber’s President-designate Ambarish Dasgupta, partner and head of management consulting KPMG, said that there were many start-ups in West Bengal, which were starved of funds.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A TV show named \"Gunsmoke\" made its debut, and another named \"Make Room for Daddy\" won two Emmys. Elvis Presley and Pat Boone had young hearts all shook up, and for the first time, they could listen to those crooners and others on a new gadget called a pocket transistor radio. A new car cost $1,900, gasoline was 23 cents a gallon and rents averaged $87 a month. It was 1955. On July 17 of that year — a year in which the last occupying troops left Austria and the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series — Disneyland opened its doors. If the first day was any indicator of its future, we might have expected Walt Disney's amusement park to fade into oblivion, much like Georgia Gibbs' No. 1 Billboard hit \"Dance With Me Henry\" did. (Quick, hum a few bars.) The chaos of Disneyland's debut played out in front of a national television audience, and predictions of epic failure abounded. Sixty years later, we know how wrong those naysayers were. With nearly 17 million annual visitors, Disneyland is the biggest draw in California and among the top tourist destinations in the world. The park's drawing power persuaded Disney to build theme parks in Florida, France, Japan and China. Other amusement parks, such as Denmark's Tivoli Gardens, existed, but Disneyland established a modern theme-park template that has been often duplicated but rarely matched. We think we know Disneyland; after all, we've had 60 years to get acquainted. But do we really? Reporters Christopher Reynolds and Brady MacDonald have compiled a list of 60 things you might not know on the diamond anniversary of the theme park that became the gold standard. 1. Much of Disneyland is built to scale to create the illusion of a full-scale experience. The trains circling the park and the Mark Twain Riverboat are built to 5/8 scale. Sleeping Beauty Castle and the storefronts on Main Street, U.S.A., use forced perspective to make the buildings appear taller. 2. More than a million corn dogs are sold annually at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park. L.A. Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold calls the Disneyland corn dog the best he's ever had. 3. The Rivers of America in Frontierland is 4 to 8 feet deep. The first time the man-made river was filled in 1955, the water seeped through the sandy soil. The riverbed was eventually lined with clay to prevent leaking. 4. The Rivers of America held 6.16 million gallons of water the first time it was filled and lost 30,000 gallons a day to evaporation. 5. Maintenance crews dump 12 pounds of green or brown dye into the water a couple of times a week to color the river. 6. The 8- to 15-foot-tall berm that surrounds Disneyland was designed to keep out the real world and keep in the fantasy world. The dirt for the berm came from the excavation of the Rivers of America. Some of the 350,000 cubic yards of excavated dirt was also used to create what would become Tom Sawyer Island. 7. The Disney family crest can be found over the entrance to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The coat of arms was placed above the arch in 1965, about a year before Walt Disney's death. 8. About 84 million Mickey Mouse ears have been sold since 1955. The Mouseketeers first wore the hats in the 1950s on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" television show. 9. More than 750 million people have visited Disneyland since opening day. It took just seven weeks for the first million visitors to walk through the gates. Attendance was 3.6 million in 1955-56, its first year of operation. 10. More than 50 scuba divers maintain the water-based attractions and waterways at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. 11. Dream of getting married in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle? You can, but it will set you back $120,000 for an after-hours ceremony. A trip in Cinderella's crystal coach is included, but if you want Mickey and Minnie Mouse to attend, it will cost you an additional $1,425 for a 30-minute visit. 12. Disneyland has a \"jail\" for disruptive guests (Disney-speak for visitors). They're typically held in a security office until Anaheim police arrive. Undercover Disney security officers have been known to watch for shoplifters. 13. No gum is sold at Disney theme parks. Walt Disney didn't want visitors to step in discarded chewing gum. 14. A small lamp remains lighted in the window above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., in memory of Walt Disney. He often stayed overnight in the 500-square-foot apartment during construction of Disneyland. A larger Disney family apartment was later built above New Orleans Square. 15. The apartment above the firehouse on Main Street, U.S.A., includes a dressing area, a kitchenette and a bathroom with a shower. The couches fold out to make additional beds. 16. On opening day, Disneyland contained 800 mostly nonindigenous species of plants from as far away as Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan. 17. More than 12,000 orange trees were removed from the 160-acre plot that became Disneyland. Some of the discarded trees were replanted upside down along the banks of the Jungle Cruise to look like mangrove roots. 18. The route of the Jungle Cruise was laid out with a Jeep outfitted to simulate the length and width of a riverboat. 19. The Mark Twain stern-wheeler, built at a cost of $150,000, was constructed in pieces and assembled at Disneyland. The upper deck was fabricated in Burbank, and the hull was built at a San Pedro shipyard, trucked overnight to the park and lifted by crane into the Rivers of America. 20. Fantasyland's carousel operated at Toronto's Sunnyside Park for decades before being moved to Disneyland in advance of the park's opening. The original carousel featured a menagerie of animals but now has only horses. Additional horses were acquired from other amusement parks. 21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million. 48. In summer 1970, somebody circulated gag fliers proposing a yippie invasion of Disneyland on Aug. 6. On the appointed day, dozens of yippies, or perhaps generic hippies, gathered on Tom Sawyer Island and raised a Viet Cong flag. Management took the rare step of closing the park five hours early, prompting a bold headline (with photos) on the next day's front page of The Times: \"Yippies' Outburst Shuts Disneyland.\" 49. When the park opened, it had both pay and free toilets. Soon after, all bathrooms became free. 50. Walt Disney and author Ray Bradbury were friends. One day at lunch, Bradbury offered to help rebuild Tomorrowland. Disney is said to have replied: \"Ray, it's no use … you're a genius and I'm a genius … after two weeks we'd kill each other!\" Later, Bradbury called it \"the nicest turndown I've ever had.\" 51. By the time It's a Small World opened at Disneyland in 1966, it had already been seen by more than 10 million visitors during its two years at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. 52. Walt Disney had a lot of input into Pirates of the Caribbean, but he died in December 1966, about four months before the ride opened. 53. In 1971, stage psychic the Amazing Criswell predicted that by 1999, Disneyland would be covered by a plastic bubble, its weather controlled by a switch. 54. Though Walt Disney sported a mustache for most of his adult life, Disneyland banned facial hair on its workers from 1957 until 2000, when restrictions were eased. 55. If Disneyland's original $1 adult admission fee had increased in lockstep with the U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, today it would be $8.87. Instead, it's $99. (But in the old days, you had to buy ride tickets separately. Now they're included.) 56. In September 1959, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a historic visit to Los Angeles and asked to see Disneyland. His minders first said yes, and then no, after Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker said he couldn't guarantee Khrushchev's safety. \"Why not?\" Khrushchev protested at a public luncheon. \"What is it? Do you have rocket-launching pads there? ... Is there an epidemic of cholera there? … Have gangsters taken hold of the place?\" 57. In Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the Toad Hall library includes these titles: \"For Whom the Toads Croak\" and \"A Tadpole Grows in Brooklyn.\" 58. When it opened in June 1959, Disneyland's monorail was the first daily operating monorail in the Western Hemisphere. 59. Sleeping Beauty Castle is 77 feet tall. Neuschwanstein, the 19th century Bavarian castle that's widely credited as its inspiration, is 213 feet high. (Neuschwanstein, about 80 miles southwest of Munich, Germany, gets 1.4 million visitors yearly.) 60. For height reasons, there's a good chance Mickey Mouse and many other costumed characters are played by female cast members. Male cast members portray the taller characters such as Goofy and Sheriff Woody. Princess characters have strict height requirements: They must be 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall.

    "LabBody": "21. The pipe organ in the Haunted Mansion's ballroom was reused from the set of the movie \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\" Capt. Nemo's organ was part of a Tomorrowland display featuring props from the movie before it was relocated to the New Orleans Square ride. 22. Walt Disney often walked around Disneyland, stood in lines with visitors and talked to children about their experiences at the park. He handed out pre-signed photo cards to visitors who asked for autographs. 23. The costumed Disney characters were not present during the park's early days. Walt's brother Roy, who ran the business side of Walt Disney Co., was concerned the characters would be tainted if the theme park failed. 24. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956, kids could borrow fishing poles at Huckleberry Finn's Fishing Pier and fish in a small pond stocked with 15,000 catfish, perch and bluegill. 25. The Golden Horseshoe saloon was modeled after the dance hall in the 1953 movie \"Calamity Jane.\" A box next to the stage was reserved for Walt Disney and his guests. 26. The original Disneyland parking lot held 12,175 cars. Much of the lot has been turned into Disney California Adventure Park, although a portion of the parking area remains behind the Tower of Terror attraction. 27. The wooden figure of an American Indian on Main Street, U.S.A., stood in front of a fine tobacco shop next door to Disneyland's cinema until 1991. Other independent retail shops have included a pharmacy, a shoe store and a lock-and-key shop. There was once an intimate apparel boutique at Disneyland known as the Wizard of Bras. 28. Many of the largest trees in Disneyland once dotted the routes of the Santa Monica, Pomona and Santa Ana freeways. Disneyland arborists paid $25 for each of the 5- to 10-foot trees, which were moved to Anaheim before the park opened. Today, about 18,000 trees can be found throughout the Disneyland resort. 29. Disneyland's work force amounts to 28,000 cast members, Disney-speak for employees. 30. The E ticket, beloved by generations of visitors because it granted passage on the most coveted rides, didn't exist in 1955. The first E tickets were issued in 1959 for use on then-new Matterhorn Bobsleds and Submarine Voyage rides. 31. Napa Rose, the fancy restaurant in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, claims a wine collection of 17,000 bottles. 32. The Disneyland Hotel, which opened in October 1955 with 100 rooms, now has 975. 33. In 1952, before Anaheim emerged as the location for Disneyland, Walt Disney went to the Burbank City Council with a proposal for a park. The council members turned him away, and one said, \"We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank.\" 34. On opening day, the beloved Jungle Cruise was known as Explorer Boat Ride Through the Rivers of Mexico, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia. 35. Ronald L. Ziegler, who went on to become Richard Nixon's presidential press secretary, worked during college as a wise-cracking pilot on the Jungle Cruise. Later, in the 1970s, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter had the same job. 36. Though many people know that Steve Martin worked at the Disneyland Magic Shop in his early days, fewer know that Martin's friend and teenage co-worker at the shop, John McEuen, went on to found the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 37. New Orleans Square includes seven ficus trees transplanted from Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Disney landscape specialist Bill Evans learned in 1962 that Pershing Square was being redone, and he made a deal to buy and transport the trees; their tops had to be cut off so they would make it through underpasses. 38. Among the first drivers on the Autopia ride on opening day were Frank Sinatra (and his son) and Sammy Davis Jr. 39. Richard Carpenter, brother and bandmate of the late Karen Carpenter, was the keyboard half of a piano-banjo duo on Main Street in 1967. He was fired for playing too much contemporary music. 40. In 1970, former Disney executive Van France founded Club 55, a group for people who worked for Disney the year Disneyland opened. Disneyland officials estimate the club's membership at 15 remaining retirees. 41. Disney officials usually have less to say about Club 33, which has its headquarters above the Blue Bayou Restaurant in New Orleans Square. The exclusive club apparently dates to 1967. Walt Disney conceived it as a way to entertain investors and other VIPs. Membership costs $12,000 per year, and you're not supposed to transfer or sell your privileges. 42. Disneyland's first Snow White was JoAnn Dean Killingsworth. An aspiring dancer and skater, Killingsworth was hired to wave at guests from a float on Disneyland's opening day. Killingsworth, who lived in Brea, died in June at age 91. 43. Over the years, Disneyland has celebrated two different opening days, for understandable reasons. On July 17, 1955, the park opened to press and invited guests, and ABC devoted 90 minutes of live coverage to the event. (Announcer Hank Weaver sat behind a typewriter in the press room to introduce master of ceremonies Art Linkletter, who introduced colleagues Bob Cummings and Ronald Reagan and pointed out the arrival of Danny Thomas and his family.) The next day, the park opened to the public; adult admission, $1, children 50 cents. 44. Disney studio executives didn't share Walt's interest in creating Disneyland, so he set up a separate company, WED Enterprises, to do advance work. To cover costs, he borrowed $100,000 against his life insurance policy. 45. The original 19th century gaslight lampposts along Main Street, U.S.A., came from Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia. 46. The Kodak Camera Center on Main Street, U.S.A., was owned by Linkletter, a friend of Disney. 47. In its first year, Disneyland had revenue of $10 million — one-third of the total gross of the Disney studio. In today's dollars, that would be $88.7 million.",

    "LabBody": "Wearing high-fashion clothing can be risky. That's a lesson Nicky Hilton learned after attending Paris Fashion week on Sunday in a white mini dress without any underwear. The hotel heiress stepped out for the Versace Haute Couture show in a 60s-inspired retro dress with gold grommets and sheer paneling along the midsection and hemline. The problem was that the dress was a little too short, and at certain angles you could see her bare rear end. When she walked to the top of a set of stairs, photographers were clearly able to snap photos of her naked backside from below. And when she leaned over at a table, her butt was also visible to bystanders. We're not sure if Hilton planned on showing so much skin while attending the event. The socialite is preparing to wed banking heir James Rothschild at London's Kensington Palace this weekend. Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, currently reside there. Hilton will reportedly wear a Valentino gown, and her sister Paris is going to show of her DJ skills at the reception, reports Page Six. See the backside pictures on page two...

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "Sea turtles are surging onto local beaches to lay their eggs in numbers much higher than average this year, but the people who monitor those nests say they’re also coping with a rising number of challenges with beachgoers. More than 1,500 sea turtle nests have been counted in Volusia and Flagler counties, including beaches on the Volusia portion of Canaveral National Seashore. Turtles will continue to nest here through early September. “It has been a very good year,” said Beth Libert, Volusia Flagler Turtle Patrol president. Statewide, “everybody is having lots of nests.” The nesting numbers in Volusia County are “extremely high,” said Jennifer Winters, who oversees the county’s habitat conservation plan. On Volusia beaches north of the Seashore, nest monitors have counted 486 loggerhead nests, 13 green turtle nests and 14 leatherback nests, “a new record high.” At the Seashore, nesting is even ahead of the “big year” in 2013, said Kristen Kneifl, resource management specialist at the Seashore. Including the nests on its Brevard portion, the Seashore has already documented more than 2,657 nests. “Everybody is very busy,” Kniefl said. “The turtles started laying pretty heavily about a month earlier than they usually do.” Sea turtle nesting season officially started on May 1 and continues through Oct. 31, though nest hatchlings could continue to emerge from their nests after that date. During that season, Volusia County law requires beachfront property owners and businesses to dim their lights to avoid luring the turtles or their hatchlings landward rather than toward the sea, where natural lighting normally traces their path. One of the bigger challenges so far this season, however, has been trying to get the message out to beachgoers to fill in the large holes they dig while playing at the beach. The holes can trap turtles that are crawling up onto the beach to nest, and they’re a “major hazard” for people walking the beach at night, said Winters. Elaine Morin, treasurer for Friends of Canaveral, called it “a huge problem.” Libert agreed. “It’s an epidemic. It’s crazy,” she said. “They’re horrendous. They’re dangerous to people and turtles.” Both Winters and Libert pointed to a case in Jacksonville this summer, where a large sea turtle fell into one of the holes and had to be rescued the next morning. When Turtle Patrol volunteers see people digging large holes or pits, they’ll stop and ask that the holes be filled in before the beachgoers leave for the evening, said Libert. “Most people are receptive,” she said. The Turtle Patrol uses signs that ask people to fill in holes when they leave the beach. Volusia County contractors who rake the beaches in the morning only fill in holes that are in front of a nest that is due to hatch, Winters said. “It’s an educational challenge,” Winters said. “We’ve tried to educate people to fill them in or build them below the tidelines, so the tide fills them in.” In particular, Volusia County has received numerous complaints about a man digging on the beach at Bethune Beach, she said. “He has been advised by Beach Safety,” she said. But technically, the man is not violating any rules. But throngs of people elsewhere along the beach have been violating rules, from.",

So blocking that process helped prevent memory loss and the development of brain plaques, or sticky proteins. “If indeed arginine consumption is so important to the disease process, maybe we could block it and reverse the disease,” says Duke’s Carol Colton. Researchers found that memory improved in mice that were treated with a drug to block the depletion of arginine. “We see this study opening the doors to thinking about Alzheimer’s in a completely different way,” Colton says.",

    "LabBody": "TRAVERSE CITY — On July 7, 2015, after an extended illness, Kathryn “Kay” Clare Hartl passed away peacefully at home with her family and holding the hand of her beloved husband of 54 years, John L. Hartl Jr. Kay was born on June 6, 1935 the daughter of Russell and Kathryn (Dittrich) Fellows. After attending St. Mary’s High School of Mt. Clemens, she studied English and teaching at Marygrove College in Detroit, graduating as valedictorian in 1957 with a Bachelors of Arts degree. She also attended graduate school at the University of Detroit. She then taught elementary school in the East Pointe area for many years. On July 8, 1961, Kay and John were married at St. Basil Church in East Pointe. Together they traveled the world on Pan American Airways, where John was employed at the time, visiting exotic destinations such as Hawaii, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, Vienna, Paris, Rome, Rio De Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima and even the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. After seeing the world with John, Kay left teaching to selflessly dedicate the rest of her life to her family, raising five children, John “Jay” Hartl, David Hartl, Jerome (Colleen) Hartl, Thomas (Jenny) Hartl and Julie Hartl. The family lived in Grosse Pointe Woods before moving to Traverse City in 1978. Each of her children have countless loving memories of growing up with Kay as their dedicated mother. In particular, Jay recalls his arm becoming stuck in an escalator handrail at a shopping mall and how mom set a precedent for his many such future adventures by handling the situation with patience, love and understanding. David recalls mom’s signature “Mickey Mouse” ice cream sundaes (complete with cookies for ears). Jerome will never forget their tradition of peeling and sharing an orange together just before bedtime. Thomas cherishes the joyfully infectious nature of mom’s laughter - how she would often laugh so hard she would begin tearing up. Julie will always treasure their many mother-daughter lunches at the Tea Room in Milliken’s Department Store. All will remember their many family breakfasts at The Omelette Shoppe, her lovably idiosyncratic habit of ending every phone conversation with the same phrase, “Okay ... uh-huh, bye-bye,” and the simple but beautiful lullaby she composed herself and sang all her children to bed with, “Dark Outside, Night-Night Time.” Perhaps her greatest joys in life were her four beloved grandchildren, Evan, Henry, Jessa and Audrey. Their frequent visits were invariably the highlight of her (and their) day. When the subject of her grandchildren came up, she would never miss the opportunity to say, “They don’t come any cuter!” Kay is also survived by her two siblings, Russ (Cindy) Fellows, of Harrison Township, and Lou Ann (Rich) Bartlett, of Warren. The Hartl family would like to extend their sincere thanks to the many kind and dedicated staff members of the following organizations that assisted with Kay’s care, Chronic Care Management, Monarch Home Health Services and LCA Homecare. A funeral Mass will be held on Monday, July 13, at 11 a.m., at St. Francis Catholic Church in Traverse City, with visitation held one hour prior. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be directed to St. Francis Catholic Church, 1025 S. Union Street, Traverse City, MI 49684 or Grand Traverse Area Catholic Schools (GTACS), 123 E. 11th Street, Traverse City, MI 49684. Please share your memories of Kay with her family by visiting www.reynolds-jonkhoff.com. The family is being cared for by Reynolds-Jonkhoff Funeral Home and Cremation Services.",

    "LabBody": "On Saturday, the day after a 39-year-old Albany resident apparently drowned, family members and friends continued their search on the Willamette River near Bowman Park. Family members identified the victim as Brian Rogers. “We’re just hoping to find him. To find the body, you know. … If it was your family, wouldn’t you want to find him?” said brother-in-law Loren Clark of Philomath, who had scanned two miles of the river in his drift boat. At noon, more than 10 people used three boats and a personal water craft to search the waterway. Others walked along the Willamette. About 15 additional residents waited for news on the riverbank, and expressed frustration that authorities weren’t doing more to help. The Albany Police Department is handling the case. The agency has not officially released the identity of the man. The call about the apparent drowning came in at 2:43 p.m. Friday, when a woman reported that a man who had been swimming near Bowman Park disappeared after calling for help. The man had been on a small air mattress, and his wife lost sight of the victim, heard him yelling, and then lost all contact. \"I couldn't have saved him. I know he went under,\" said his wife, Lesli Rogers, as she sat at Bowman Park on Saturday. Five Albany officers responded Friday afternoon, along with two boats from the Benton County Sheriff’s Office, one boat from the Linn County Sheriff’s Office, the Linn County Dive Team and multiple boats from the Albany Fire Department. Public safety crews scoured the area for about 90 minutes and found the rubber air mattress. Some police and fire workers remained on scene for the remainder of the day with hopes of locating and recovering the man's body. On Saturday, Benton County Sheriff's Office deputies talked with the man's family at about 2:30 p.m., and said they would be patrolling the area near Bowman Park and keeping an eye out. They told family members that it could be days before the body surfaces, and that local public safety agencies were busy elsewhere on the water because of the holiday. Albany Police Department Sgt. Steve Dorn said that the Willamette River at Bowman has a current, and people swimming there might not be able to easily get back to the spot where they entered the water. \"It's dangerous. I think that goes for all water. People need to be aware,\" he added. Rogers' mother and sister said that he wasn't a strong swimmer, but was 20 to 30 feet off the bank at the east end of Bowman Park. “He could swim a little bit, but not well enough to fight the current,” said his sister, Amy Rogers. Family members said Rogers, who grew up in Albany, had five children and loved flying remote control helicopters with youngsters. Amy Rogers added that her brother was mischievous and could be a jokester. People gathered at Bowman Park said they hoped other residents with boats would join in the search. Clark said that if Rogers' body wasn't found on Saturday, the search would continue on Sunday. Rogers' apparent drowning would be the second in less than a week for the area. On June 28, a Salem man drowned in the Santiam River at the Santiam River Rest Stop. Kyle Odegard can be reached at kyle.odegard@lee.net, 541-812-6077 or via Twitter @KyleOdegard.Â",

    "LabBody": "CORVALLIS — Runs were at a premium once again at Goss Stadium. Much like a night earlier the Corvallis Knights got a complete-game shutout from their starting pitcher, Slater Lee, and got only one run to beat the Kitsap Blue Jackets 1-0 on Friday. “We just didn’t hit a lot of balls on the barrel today at all. Fortunately we got the performance from Slater, Corvallis coach Brooke Knight said. \"But tomorrow, I imagine it will be a tall order to do that again.” Unlike Thursday, the Knights did not have an early lead to defend. Rather, they found themselves in a scoreless tie until Nick Madrigal broke through in the eighth. Despite the absence of offense, Lee remained focused. “The scoreboard is something you can’t really control on the offensive end as a pitcher so you have to go out there and do your job and hope for the best,” Lee said. The Knights threatened early with Madrigal recording the game’s first hit but a sacrifice fly attempt was not deep enough and Madrigal was tagged out at the plate ending the inning. John Oltman pitched a solid seven innings for the Blue Jackets, allowing only three hits through seven innings and at one time retiring 17 consecutive Knights batters. He seemed to be running out of gas in the seventh as he faced a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the seventh, allowing two of his three hits and walking a third batter with two outs. He got out of the inning when Ryan Matrenga popped out to end the inning. Oltman turned the game over to the Kitsap bullpen and Tyler Gartner. Christian Donahue picked the right time to get his only hit of the game as he welcomed Gartner to the game with a one-out single. Unable to string together hits, the Knights manufactured offense with some small ball, bunting Donahue over to second before he stole third. Madrigal, the only batter who had any success against Kitsap pitching, stepped in the box and sent a grounder to third baseman Joe Siegal who mishandled the ball, allowing Madrigal to get on base and Donahue to score what turned out to be the winning run. “I wanted to put the ball in play and give our team a chance to win.\" Madrigal said. \"Right when I hit it I was trying to run as hard as I could and beat it out. But thankfully he bobbled it.\" Lee dominated the ninth inning, with three ground balls to earn the win. “(Lee) got a lot of ground balls so tip the cap to Slater for us. We had another great performance on the mound,” Knight said. With back-to-back complete games for the Knights, the bullpen has had an impromptu two-day vacation as the starters have dominated the Blue Jackets. Knight said he feels the rest will help the team down the stretch. “It’s a big deal because you don’t know if you need those arms the next night,\" he said. \"Those two performances did a lot to reload that bullpen and they will be ready to go again tomorrow.\" The Knights have won 12 of their last 13 games and will wrap up their three-game series against the Blue Jackets on Saturday.",

    "LabBody": "There have been several recent stories about IRS that have been minimally covered by the mainstream media outlets. In the 2015 filing season, the IRS answered less than 50 percent of customer calls. They diverted a significant amount from their customer service budget to other areas of their budget. There was a story that many IRS employees cheated on their taxes. In most cases they were not fired as required, and in some cases they were even promoted. The IRS also pays tens of millions of dollars in bonuses each year, including $40,000 per year to Lois Lerner, who lead the targeting of conservative groups. Lerner already made $175,000 per year, which is three and a half times the median U.S. family income. A couple weeks ago I read the IRS does not have a good method to determine who gets taxpayer subsidies for health insurance. The IRS inspector general just reported that IRS employees \"accidentally\" deleted backup tapes of Lerner's e-mails. Of course, the president, Democrats and the IRS director blame the problems on Republican budget cuts. From www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals I found the following on IRS budgets: 1970, $917 million; 1990, $5.824 trillion; 2010, $11.906 trillion; and 2014, $11.695 trillion. They had a 1,200-percent increase over 40 years and a less than 2 percent cut in four years. I think most individuals and businesses could live with that. We are broke because we just look at last year's budget instead of putting things in historical perspective. Jack Hellner. Springfield.",

    "DiffbotBody": "With just one former winner in this year’s field, the 2015 Home Run Derby is likely to have a first-time champion. A few days before this year’s contest, the runner-up in the 2014 Derby is the favorite to win the title during MLB's All-Star break. Todd Frazier (7/2) has been given the best betting odds at Bovada.lv to win the competition, leading the rest of the contestants. The Cincinnati Reds third baseman was a longshot to win the title last year, but he made it all the way to the finals, falling to back-to-back champion Yoenis Cespedes. After hitting a career-high 29 home runs in 2014, Frazier has emerged as one of MLB’s top power hitters. His 25 home runs are the second-most of any player in the 2015 Derby, and he tails Giancarlo Stanton by just two home runs for the Major-League lead. Kris Bryant (5/1) is the second favorite, even though he has fewer home runs than any other contestant this season. He’s one of just two players in the field that doesn’t have at least 16 home runs and rank no worse than 21st in the Majors. The Chicago Cubs rookie has 12 dingers, though he didn’t start the season in the big leagues. He’s averaging a home run in nearly every 23 at-bats. The only contestant that’s won the competition before is Prince Fielder (11/2), having taken home the trophy in both 2009 and 2012. He’s having one of his worst home-run seasons of his career with just 13 long balls, but the designated hitter has been terrific for the Texas Rangers in 2015. His .345 batting average is second in the American League, and only Frazier and Bryant have better odds to win the Derby. Albert Pujols (6/1) is the AL leader with 26 home runs, topping every other contestant. He’s competed in the event three times, never winning and having his best finish 12 years ago when he came in second place behind Garrett Anderson. Chicago is the only team that has two representatives in the contest. Bryant has better odds than Anthony Rizzo (13/2), even though the first baseman has hit four more home runs than his teammate. Joc Pederson, Josh Donaldson and Manny Machado are all tied for having the worst odds (7/1) of anyone in Monday’s competition. Pederson has 20 home runs and he's a leading candidate, along with Bryant, to be named the National League Rookie of the Year. Donaldson has 21 home runs, and he’s in the conversation for AL MVP. Machado’s 19 home runs are already a career-high. Along with Frazier, Donaldson competed in last year’s Home Run Derby. He didn’t make it out of the first round, hitting just three long balls. Giancarlo Stanton, Mike Trout and Bryce Harper are among the notable names that won't be in the 2015 Derby.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Would you run from a dinosaur in these shoes? From dinosaur theme parks to the red carpets of Cannes, everyone seems to be talking about high-heeled shoes. Find out why stilettos and pumps are all the rage, and what to do when they make your feet hurt… High-heeled shoes can pinch, squeeze, knock your joints out of whack and make you wobble and fall as you walk. They can cause painful, ugly foot problems, and as many as one-third of women suffer permanent issues from wearing them, according to the American Osteopathic Association. Still, high heels are having a moment. Powerful women, from political leaders to CEOs to Hollywood stars, wear them for work and play. Kim Kardashian totters in stylish stilettos mid-pregnancy. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard even flees dinosaurs in heels in the blockbuster film “Jurassic World.”",
    "LabBody": "Stylist Anya Sarre recommends wearing heels but always having flats on hand. Preventing High Heel Harm If you want to wear high heels, here’s how to prevent long-term damage: Limit the amount of time you wear them, says epidemiologist Gerald McGwin, Ph.D., author of the University of Alabama study. Don heels for an evening out or a day at the office if necessary, but change out of them when it’s time to walk, do chores or relax. Be careful at home. Most footwear-related accidents occur at home, especially when walking on plush carpeting, wood floors and stairs, McGwin found. Do heel exercises: To avoid injuries, Yong-Seok Jee, M.D., a professor of exercise physiology at Hanseo University and who led the story, recommends doing simple exercises to strengthen the ankles: First, stand barefoot and then rise onto your toes repeatedly. Then practice heel drops. Stand on the edge of a stair and slowly lower your heel over the edge. (Don't try these moves on crowded or public staircases.) Slip off your heels at work. That’s because sitting in heels “can alter the resting length of the muscles and tendons around the ankle,” according to the New York Times. Wear “comfort” shoes. Some shoe companies build more comfort into their shoe lines, such as Aerosoles flexible pumps and sandals with cushioned insoles, and Rockport's Adiprene by Adidas, which uses sneaker technology for cushion and support. Some designers, such as Tanya Heath, offer convertible heels, which can switch from high to low at the touch of a button. Carry several pairs of shoes. Hollywood stylist Anya Sarre – a self-described “mom in heels” – says she wore high heels throughout her first pregnancy but switched to flats for safety while caring for her 2-year-old son, Sawyer. Her tip: When attending dressy affairs, carry low, bejeweled sandals or slip-ons, such as leather ballet flats, which can be bent, folded and tucked into a purse, and traded with less comfortable shoes when needed. “I have five pairs of shoes in my car at any time,” Sarre says. That’ll come in handy if she ever finds herself running through a jungle with a T. rex at her heels.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. And with that, here is how I view the first round. 1. Tampa Bay Bucs - QB Jameis Winston, FSU - I still think Marcus Mariota has a chance to be selected here, much more than given credit for. As Yahoo's Charles Robinson reported, the Glazers have final say in signing off on Winston. But mocks are for what I think will happen, and most signs still point to Jameis. Winston can be a quality starter in the NFL. 2. Tennessee Titans - WR Amari Cooper, Alabama - A shocker, I know. No QB, no trade - I think the connection between Jacksonville and Cooper is permeating to push the move into fruition. My twitter friend Thomas Gower thinks Cooper would be the receiver pick over Kevin White. From a receiver style this does not make a ton of sense, but from a “safe” and projectable traits stance it does. 3. Jacksonville Jaguars - DL Leonard Williams, USC - Everyone is mocking an edge rusher here. I bet the Jaguars think they can get their edge rusher, for the role he will play, in the second round (Eli Harold, for example). Yes, the team signed Jared Odrick to play either the big end or 3 technique. I think the team is concerned with Sen’Derrick Marks’ availability early in the season. Marks’ contract is also very easy to move on from, if necessary. Adding another versatile piece up front that could be viewed as “safe” makes sense. 4. Cleveland Browns (via Oakland Raiders) - QB Marcus Mariota, Oregon - This one is going to get a bit complicated, but stay with me. The first part of the deal is obvious. Here is the hypothetical trade, via Alan Dandar: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. Yes, I know the Jimmy Johnson chart is outdated. But for this purpose, let's use it. Some teams still refer to it as a comparable. For the Browns: After the GM and owner made the wrong quarterback choice last year, there is pressure to make the decision right. Mariota will do just that. 5. Washington Redskins - OL Brandon Scherff, Iowa - Mimicking the recent approach of a division rival. I bet many teams will think Scherff is this year’s Zack Martin. Some might think this is early for a guard. Maybe, but acquiring prospects with traits that translate is paramount. 6. New York Jets - T Andrus Peat, Stanford - Links have sprouted in recent days placing Peat to the Jets as a long term replacement for D’Brickashaw Ferguson. It makes sense. The question is where Peat plays in 2015 before moving to left tackle in 2016. The Jets have had guard issues. 7. Oakland Raiders (via Chicago Bears) - EDGE Alvin Dupree, Kentucky - After trading down, the Raiders trade back up to land their target. Again, via Alan Dandar, here is the second hypothetical trade: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. This leaves the Raiders with picks 7, 19 and 71 in the first three rounds, basically converting a second round pick into pick No. 19 by just moving down a few slots. Dupree’s play on the field does not warrant a selection this early, but due to the “upside” I would be surprised if Bud isn’t a top three edge rusher selected. 8. Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Dante Fowler, Florida - There are plenty of connections here. Namely, the position need and Dan Quinn’s history with Fowler. Fowler is very active with his hand and length use to create separation. I bet he is the standard top edge rusher on most teams’ boards. 9. New York Giants - WR Kevin White, WVU - Another WR for the Giants? It seems the team focuses on OL, WR and pass rushers early on. The prospects left at two of those positions do not fit the Giants’ types.Rueben Randle is average and has one year left. Victor Cruz is coming off injury. The team did give a large contract to Dwayne Harris, but he would be best inside. White and OBJ would be quite a tandem. 10. St. Louis Rams - OL La’El Collins, LSU - I have no idea how to approach La’El’s projection. So, I will just keep it where it is. If the Rams select Collins, who plays LT? Either way, you have two powerful blockers along the offensive line in an offense that will need to keep its quarterback clean in the pocket and open running lanes. 11. Minnesota Vikings - CB Trae Waynes, Michigan State - Everything points to the Vikings selecting a cornerback. So will it happen? I could see one of three names: Waynes, Byron Jones and Kevin Johnson. Waynes is a press corner (or man in his zone) who uses length and frame to stick with receivers and combat the catch point. 12. Chicago Bears (via Raiders and Browns) - DT Danny Shelton, Washington - The Bears drop down only a few spots and exchange a third for a second and a six for a five. Look at pick No. 7 for more details. The team does not have a natural fit at nose tackle, and Shelton has consistently said the Bears have Browns have displayed the most interest in him. 13. New Orleans Saints - EDGE Vic Beasley, Clemson - My buddy Tony Pauline recently stated the Saints are very interested in Beasley. Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16. Houston Texans - CB Byron Jones, UConn - When I look at the Texans I see a glaring need at corner with Johnathan Joseph likely entering his last year with the team. But why is it not frequently mocked in the first round. The NFL like Jones more than I do. Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage.

Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16. Houston Texans - CB Byron Jones, UConn - When I look at the Texans I see a glaring need at corner with Johnathan Joseph likely entering his last year with the team. But why is it not frequently mocked in the first round. The NFL like Jones more than I do. ~ Evan Silva (@EvanSilva) is the Senior Football Editor for Rotoworld's NFL Page, and Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) leads Rotoworld's college football and NFL draft coverage. Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. 17. San Diego Chargers - RB Melvin Gordon III, Wisconsin - Two running backs in the top 20? Let’s destroy the narrative, NFL. Again, I’ll bring back the “foundation piece” logic. A team could look at other non-RB talents in this class and view them as role players. Then they could look at a ball carrier. 18. Kansas City Chiefs - LB Eric Kendricks, UCLA - The Chiefs have to improve their inside linebackers. With so much talent up front, Kendricks would thrive in Kansas City. Add in the fact Derrick Johnson is in a contract year coming off injury, and it makes a lot of sense. 19. Oakland Raiders (via Cleveland Browns) - WR Breshad Perriman, UCF - Receiver is still a need for the Raiders. If they want Derek Carr to stretch the field more this year, they need a receiver with those intermediate and downfield skills. Perriman has them. 20. Philadelphia Eagles - OL Donovan Smith, Penn State - Surprise? Smith checks all the boxes the Eagles (apparently) look for: Senior Bowler, athletic and visited the team’s facility. I don’t love Smith’s game, but teams who do likely think he can play guard and tackle. They must be able to unpack the traits he offers. 21. Cincinnati Bengals - T D.J. Humphries, Florida - I don’t love this fit. However, both of the Bengals’ tackles are entering contract years. Humphries, Cedric Ogbuehi, Ereck Flowers, etc. are all options. Humphries has added weight during the draft process and now sits above 300 pounds. 22. Pittsburgh Steelers - CB Kevin Johnson, Wake Forest - Kevin Johnson could be selected much earlier. The Wake Forest corner has awareness and finds the football in both man and zone situations. There is little wasted movement to his game and he attacks the catch point. 23. Detroit Lions - DT Grady Jarrett, Clemson - Grady is not just a 1 technique. Yes, he can play it in the NFL and di at Clemson, but expect him to play a lot of 3 technique in the NFL. He will be an upfield disruptor from either spot while also holding his own against the run. He should be a first round pick, and the Lions have a need now and in the future. 24. Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Shane Ray, Missouri - This is a tough call, as Ray could easily land in the second round. He tested as a bad athlete (in the 22nd percentile for his position) but does maximize it on the field and possesses a great motor. Does that tape compensate for poor athleticism, a toe injury which might need surgery and a recent marijuana citation? I think Preston Smith and Owamagbe Odighizuwa are more talented prospects, but this isn’t an exercise in what I would do. 25. Carolina Panthers - LB Shaq Thompson, Washington - I know, where is the tackle? Cedric Ogbuehi makes a lot of sense. So does an edge rusher like Owa or Preston Smith. But Shaq’s comparison has been Thomas Davis all along, and the team needs TD’s long term replacement. Shaq can fill a coverage role early on in high percentage passing situations. 26. Baltimore Ravens - DL Arik Armstead, Oregon - Personally, I think Ozzie gets another great talent here. CB Marcus Peters is an obvious possibility. Chris Canty is a stopgap (not in a negative way) and the ravens are always built from the inside-out. Armstead, Brandon Williams and Timmy Jernigan form a nice young core. 27. Dallas Cowboys - EDGE Randy Gregory, Nebraska - I think Gregory’s “fall” ends here. Talent wise, Gregory is near the top. The Cowboys will likely be without Greg Hardy for 10 games, so they still have a monstrous edge rushing need. Enter Gregory who has speed and power despite playing around 230 lbs. 28. Denver Broncos - OL Jake Fisher, Oregon - The Broncos have needs at tackle and guard. Fisher has played both tackle spots along with guard and has athleticism to be used in Gary Kubiak’s zone scheme. It is a great fit. 29. Indianapolis Colts - S Damarious Randall, Arizona State - If teams are moving towards Randall as the first safety off the board it is due to coverage range. They are not prioritizing a box safety, and instead want to choose Randall who can cover more ground. I do not think his talent warrants this high of a selection. 30. Green Bay Packers - DB Eric Rowe, Utah - This fit makes too much sense, and it is rarely mocked. Rowe will be evaluated at both corner and safety. He is the best athlete among defensive backs this year and is long, two traits the Packers look for at the position. 31. New Orleans Saints (via Seahawks) - G Cameron Erving, FSU - Yes, the Saints added Max Unger. But a hole at one interior OL spot is glaring. Erving showed promise at left tackle, however, he solidified the Noles’ OL while at center. He is being evaluated at all three spots. 32. New England Patriots - G A.J. Cann, South Carolina - The Patriots have done a TON of work on this year’s interior group. Expect them to trade down a few slots and grab Cann or Laken Tomlinson in the early second round. One possible trade up? The Vikings for Preston Smith. continue story »",

Together, they're breaking down every team's biggest needs and offering potential solutions in May's draft. For a breakdown on every team, check out the team-by-team draft preview schedule. If you are looking for my opinion on prospects, here is my top 200. And with that, here is how I view the first round. 1. Tampa Bay Bucs - QB Jameis Winston, FSU - I still think Marcus Mariota has a chance to be selected here, much more than given credit for. As Yahoo's Charles Robinson reported, the Glazers have final say in signing off on Winston. But mocks are for what I think will happen, and most signs still point to Jameis. Winston can be a quality starter in the NFL. 2. Tennessee Titans - WR Amari Cooper, Alabama - A shocker, I know. No QB, no trade - I think the connection between Jacksonville and Cooper is permeating to push the move into fruition. My twitter friend Thomas Gower thinks Cooper would be the receiver pick over Kevin White. From a receiver style this does not make a ton of sense, but from a “safe” and projectable traits stance it does. 3. Jacksonville Jaguars - DL Leonard Williams, USC - Everyone is mocking an edge rusher here. I bet the Jaguars think they can get their edge rusher, for the role he will play, in the second round (Eli Harold, for example). Yes, the team signed Jared Odrick to play either the big end or 3 technique. I think the team is concerned with Sen’Derrick Marks’ availability early in the season. Marks’ contract is also very easy to move on from, if necessary. Adding another versatile piece up front that could be viewed as “safe” makes sense. 4. Cleveland Browns (via Oakland Raiders) - QB Marcus Mariota, Oregon - This one is going to get a bit complicated, but stay with me. The first part of the deal is obvious. Here is the hypothetical trade, via Alan Dandar: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. Yes, I know the Jimmy Johnson chart is outdated. But for this purpose, let's use it. Some teams still refer to it as a comparable. For the Browns: After the GM and owner made the wrong quarterback choice last year, there is pressure to make the decision right. Mariota will do just that. 5. Washington Redskins - OL Brandon Scherff, Iowa - Mimicking the recent approach of a division rival. I bet many teams will think Scherff is this year’s Zack Martin. Some might think this is early for a guard. Maybe, but acquiring prospects with traits that translate is paramount. 6. New York Jets - T Andrus Peat, Stanford - Links have sprouted in recent days placing Peat to the Jets as a long term replacement for D’Brickashaw Ferguson. It makes sense. The question is where Peat plays in 2015 before moving to left tackle in 2016. The Jets have had guard issues. 7. Oakland Raiders (via Chicago Bears) - EDGE Alvin Dupree, Kentucky - After trading down, the Raiders trade back up to land their target. Again, via Alan Dandar, here is the second hypothetical trade: @JoshNorris Even money with \"JimmyJ\" Chart - OAK gives 4,68,140 to CLE for 12,19,202. OAK then gives 12,35,221 to CHI for 7,71,183. Simple. — Alan Dandar (@AlanDandar) April 30, 2015. This leaves the Raiders with picks 7, 19 and 71 in the first three rounds, basically converting a second round pick into pick No. 19 by just moving down a few slots. Dupree’s play on the field does not warrant a selection this early, but due to the “upside” I would be surprised if Bud isn’t a top three edge rusher selected. 8. Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Dante Fowler, Florida - There are plenty of connections here. Namely, the position need and Dan Quinn’s history with Fowler. Fowler is very active with his hand and length use to create separation. I bet he is the standard top edge rusher on most teams’ boards. 9. New York Giants - WR Kevin White, WVU - Another WR for the Giants? It seems the team focuses on OL, WR and pass rushers early on. The prospects left at two of those positions do not fit the Giants’ types.Rueben Randle is average and has one year left. Victor Cruz is coming off injury. The team did give a large contract to Dwayne Harris, but he would be best inside. White and OBJ would be quite a tandem. 10. St. Louis Rams - OL La’El Collins, LSU - I have no idea how to approach La’El’s projection. So, I will just keep it where it is. If the Rams select Collins, who plays LT? Either way, you have two powerful blockers along the offensive line in an offense that will need to keep its quarterback clean in the pocket and open running lanes. 11. Minnesota Vikings - CB Trae Waynes, Michigan State - Everything points to the Vikings selecting a cornerback. So will it happen? I could see one of three names: Waynes, Byron Jones and Kevin Johnson. Waynes is a press corner (or man in his zone) who uses length and frame to stick with receivers and combat the catch point. 12. Chicago Bears (via Raiders and Browns) - DT Danny Shelton, Washington - The Bears drop down only a few spots and exchange a third for a second and a six for a five. Look at pick No. 7 for more details. The team does not have a natural fit at nose tackle, and Shelton has consistently said the Bears have Browns have displayed the most interest in him. 13. New Orleans Saints - EDGE Vic Beasley, Clemson - My buddy Tony Pauline recently stated the Saints are very interested in Beasley. Why wouldn’t every team be interested in a ridiculous edge rusher with unreal athleticism who can at least offer outside speed with bend. It lines up perfectly with a need for the Saints. 14. Miami Dolphins - RB Todd Gurley, Georgia - Lamar Miller had a solid season last year. However, is he a foundation piece or more like a ball carrier who maximizes the space blocked for him? Gurley is one of the few true foundation talents in this class. RBs who sit on the spectrum of average to good do not deserve high priced contracts. Gurley would be an upgrade at the position and would theoretically prevent the Dolphins from overpaying Miller. 15. San Francisco 49ers - WR DeVante Parker, Louisville - Beyond Anquan Boldin, the 49ers lack a receiver who can be trusted in contested situations. Boldin might be nearing the end of his career, and Vernon Davis can say the same with the 49ers - potentially. Parker floats to win on 50/50 targets and in the redzone. 16.

    "LabBody": "The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism and the Waconda Lake Association hosted the 11th annual Youth Fishing Tournament at Waconda Lake on June 6. About 150 young anglers boarded boats with a warm, breezy morning welcoming them on the water. By lunchtime, the wind was gusting 20-25 mph and temperatures had heated up, but the morning allowed for comfortable fishing for all involved. The fishing was better this year compared with last year’s cold and very windy conditions, and most were able to bring in at least a few, with walleye, drum, wiper and channel catfish leading the way. Of the 145 youth who fished on the 40 boats volunteered by local anglers and the eight youth who fished off the bank, 133 (87 percent) were able to catch at least one fish. The total of 782 caught fish included 445 walleye, 158 drum, 66 wipers, 54 channel catfish, 31 white bass, 16 smallmouth bass, five flathead catfish, three gar, two bluegill, one crappie, and one striped bass. Area winners in each of the categories include: Biggest crappie: Noah Gerstner, of Beloit, 11 inches; biggest channel catfish, Eli Hahn, of Cawker City, 27 inches; biggest white bass, Cooper Duskie, of Glen Elder, 16¼ inches; biggest wiper, Cadyn Brummer, of Randall, 25¾ inches; biggest smallmouth bass, Cheyenne Mohler, of Mankato, 16.5 inches; biggest drum, Preston Ostmeyer, of Natoma, 22½ inches; biggest bluegill, Hannah Starbuck, of Beloit, 9 inches; biggest gar, Caleb Hake, of Cawker City, 41 inches; and smallest fish, Olivia Wright, of Beloit, 4 inches (striper). Organizers would like to extend a special thank-you to of the boat drivers and other volunteers who provided their time and equipment, the Waconda Lake Association for providing lunch and helping cover the cost of the T-shirts, and Wayne Miner, who donated 150 dozen nightcrawlers. Also, thanks to the 83 sponsors who donated nearly $4,000 in prizes. Because of their generosity each youth was able to take home a new fishing pole, T-shirt, goodie bag of tackle and gift certificates, and other prizes.

    "LabBody": "SILVIS, Ill. – Following a rusty even-par 71 on Day 1 at TPC Deere Run, Jordan Spieth started his second round Friday primarily concerned with making the cut. “I knew I needed to shoot at least 67 to have a chance,” he said. Instead, he rolled to a 7-under 64 to enter the clubhouse just three back of the lead at the John Deere Classic. After going off on the back and carding four consecutive pars to start his round, Spieth made his first birdie, a kick-in at the short par-4 14th, and went on a tear. In a seven-hole stretch from Nos. 14-2, he made four birdies and an eagle to get to minus-6 and put the cut line well behind him. “From there the cut line was out of my head, and then it was just how can we move up the board a little more?” he said. Following two more birdies at Nos. 5 and 7, and two key up-and-downs at 4 and 6, Spieth actually took it as low as 8 under before making his first and only bogey of the day thanks to a wayward drive at the par-4 eighth. The flat stick that wouldn’t cooperate for him in Round 1 turned red hot in Round 2, as Spieth needed just 25 putts on Friday and one-putted seven greens on his second nine. Through the morning wave, he’s leading the field in the second round in strokes gained-putting. “I let a couple slide by the hole early, and then I just told myself, ‘I’m not going to miss any more putts low,’” he said. “I was a little more aggressive today and it paid off.” Spieth can now transition from worrying about the weekend to focusing on potentially winning this event for the second time in three years. “Today was a solid round to put myself into position to maybe make a little run at it,” he said.",

    "LabBody": "Quad-City motorists passing through downtown Bettendorf should expect daily changes to traffic patterns and an increase in orange cones as crews continue to ramp up work around the Interstate 74 bridge. Bettendorf Police Chief Phil Redington wants drivers to stay patient. “If you need to be somewhere, leave earlier because you just don’t know what the traffic patterns will be down here,” he said. “It’s going to be a long process, but downtown Bettendorf is open for business.” For starters, Illinois-bound motorists traveling east through downtown Bettendorf can no longer merge onto I-74 from State Street. Weather permitting, Iowa Department of Transportation officials predict the ramp will be closed until mid-August. In the meantime, detour signs redirect motorists north via 14th Street and back west to the Grant Street entrance ramp onto I-74, where things have gotten extra messy. From Grant Street, motorists can access the eastbound loop ramp — that now surrounds a permanent detention pond — via 13th Street, which serves one lane in each direction. Crews poured a temporary stretch of pavement to connect 13th Street with the Illinois-bound ramp, while southbound traffic on Kimberly Road has been tapered into one lane. “It will look a lot better when it’s done,” Mark Brandl, construction engineer for the DOT, said. “It’s going to be a headache for a lot of property owners down there, but when it’s done, it will be much more accommodating to traffic and will certainly help us build the new bridge.” More congestion. Downtown Bettendorf business owner Tambi Rosendahl, who recently renovated the entrance to her salon at 2242 State St., said she doesn’t mind the congestion. “I love the location, and I’m a people watcher,” said Rosendahl, as she peered through the glass doors and windows at Tambi Salon. “The construction slows people down.” Brandl said additional changes to Grant Street this week have caused confusion for motorists and increased congestion. Westbound traffic on Grant Street is currently restricted to two lanes between 17th Street and 11th Street. While the north lane of Grant Street will be closed until the end of October, Brandl said motorists aren’t taking advantage of the open lane on the south side of the roadway. “We’ve got detour pavement there that they aren’t driving on,” he added. “I’ve dealt with these things for years; it always takes a little training for the locals to get through it the first few days.” On State Street, Brandl said crews this year are primarily repairing storm water, sewer and gas lines to prevent any potential issues with underground utilities in the future when construction on the new Interstate 74 bridge begins. “The goal here is to get three lanes open on Grant by the end of the year,” he said. City work. On Monday, city of Bettendorf crews will begin work of their own just east of downtown. For four to six weeks, motorists should expect lane closures in both directions on State Street between 26th Street and 42nd Street, according to a notice from the city. Crews will replace aging stormwater catch basins underneath the roadway, and only one lane on one side of the road will be barricaded at a time, the notice said. Where possible, the middle turn lane may be used to maintain two lanes of traffic in both directions, Bettendorf Public Works director Brian Schmidt said. “Even though State Street is a DOT route, the city is responsible for the infrastructure underneath it,” Schmidt added. “It needs to get done.” Crews will begin work first on the north side of State Street between 26th and 33rd streets. Bridge repairs. To further complicate things, beginning July 20, Illinois-bound traffic on the I-74 bridge will be reduced to one lane while crews repair the top deck of the structure. “None of it’s convenient, but in order to keep the bridge open, it’s stuff we need to do,” said Brandl, who added the work will keep one lane closed at all times until Aug. 9. Crews also will be rehabbing portions of westbound lanes on the bridge, which will result in nighttime lane closures through July 20. Looking ahead, the State Street/14th Street exit ramp off I-74 also will be closed starting next month. “We’re trying to keep it together and make sure it’s in good shape as the new bridge gets built,” Brandl said. “We’re hoping this is the last project on 74, but I’m not holding my breath.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Southwest Airlines' controversial CEO Gary Kelly appears to have opened a huge hornets' nest in the wake of news about a tentative agreement on a new contract with more than 13,500 unionized flight attendants who work at the low-fare behemoth. With Southwest's largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, Chicago also is the domicile for the largest number of Southwest flight attendants, more than 1,800 altogether, according to a spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents Southwest flight attendants. Local 556's executive board, comprised of 17 members with varying degrees of seniority within the Southwest flight attendant ranks, voted by a margin of 12 to 5 in favor of the new contract, signaling the move to present the new contract to rank and file membership to consider and vote on starting Wednesday. But even before Local 556 members see the proposed contract, news of a tentative deal has exposed deep rifts within the Local 556 membership, as well as questions about the possible motives of the union's own executive board and of Southwest Airlines management, including Kelly. In an email to this reporter, one Southwest flight attendant who has clocked more than two decades with the airline, claimed \"some of this union leadership, as well as the negotiating team, have a long history of self-service, bullying and not always acting in the best interest of the flight attendants. Also there is a strong belief among flight attendants that this union is in bed with the company and that they will sell us out.\" Another flight attendant with more than a decade of work at Southwest offered a similar sentiment in an email: \"The (Local 556) union does appear to be too cozy with management.\" Though so-called \"educators\" have been used by Local 556 in the past to help members sort through and understand details of proposed contracts, some flight attendants questioned that procedure this time around, suggesting it could be another means of influencing— or pressuring — union members to vote in favor of a new contract. Noted one Southwest flight attendant: \"Our union handpicked 100 people to fly into Dallas for 'tentative agreement' training with our union dollars for two days so they could 'educate' the rest of us on the tentative agreement.\" Some flight attendants also wondered why Southwest management was suddenly able to come to tentative terms with flight attendants, while other major unions, including those representing pilots, ramp agents and mechanics, have been unable to get even a tentative deal. Ramp agents, in particular, have been in talks for some four years. Flight attendant contract negotiations had been ongoing for two years. The rank and file members of Local 556 will be able to get their first look at the full contract starting tomorrow. Then they will have 16 days to obtain the proposed contract, read it, digest it and then vote — a shorter time frame than the 30-day window for previous contracts, according to some flight attendants who wonder why this is all suddenly so rushed. A Local 556 spokesman said the contract would be ratified if a majority of those who actually vote cast a vote in favor of ratification. As for the vocal backlash among some rank and file union members to news of the tentative contract, a Local 556 spokesman noted: \"We are a large group and not everyone is going to see things the same way.\" By the end of July, however, it should be clear whether enough flight attendants see the proposed contract the same way Southwest Airlines management and Local 556's executive board apparently do.",

After biking, walking, and driving past it hundreds of times in the years that I’ve lived in San Francisco, I finally had lunch at Irma’s Pampanga on 16th Street and South Van Ness. The corner has been in the news lately, as the vacant lot across the street was set to be luxe condos and its now slated for an all-affordable development. It’s the precise kind of small business that tends to suffer from sudden changes to a neighborhood’s fabric, but maybe now Irma’s will stick around for a while. click to enlarge. Peter Lawrence Kane Gray day at IRma's Having been around since 1990 (with a 1999-2003 hiatus) Irma’s is not entirely under-the-radar. Apart from a highly visible location at a fairly major intersection, it pops up at various Asian street festivals and had a booth at Pride a few years back. There were only five or six people in there, which meant lots and lots of empty seats, but speedy service. And for the record, “Pampanga” is a province of the Philippines. I got the special combo, a plate of pancit (noodles) with Shanghai lumpia (fried pork spring rolls), and some barbecued pork on a skewer. When I said yes to the offer of sauce, the woman behind the counter dunked the skewer into the vat whence it came. (For the lumpia, I also helped myself to some Mang Tomas All-Purpose Sauce, made from pork livers.) click to enlarge. Peter Lawrence Kane You got options. Let’s talk about the décor, which ain’t much: linoleum tile, wood paneling, utilitarian tables and chairs, colored panels behind the counter, a row of windows with sheer white curtains tied in the center, and Filipino soaps on TV. And there’s a ghost bike chained directly in front of the door. While I was leaving, a woman dashed out ahead of me because she’d parked in the red zone and an Interceptor was eyeing her SUV warily. Apologizing profusely, she merely waited until the meter-mister had moved on before blithely heading back into finish her lunch. Kudos to you, brazen diner! I wouldn’t say that I loved my meal, which had the homogenized, cooked-in-big-batches-and-kept-warm-in-smaller-batches qualities of middling Chinese takeout, with slightly different ingredients. (Maybe next time I will venture into whole fried fish territory.) But you really can’t beat the $8 price tag, or the authenticity. Hopefully, Irma’s finds a new fan base in the seven stories’ worth of new neighbors its about to get, and sticks around for a long time. Irma’s Pampanga, 2901 16th St., 415-626-6688.",

    "LabBody": "WASHINGTON | Michelle Obama on Thursday told hundreds of Native American youths that they are all precious and sacred and that \"each of you was put on this earth for a reason.\" \"Each of you has something that you're destined to do, whether that's raising a beautiful family, whether that's succeeding in a profession or leading your community into a better future,\" the first lady said in a sometimes emotional address at a first-time summit called by the White House. \"You all have a role to play and we need you.\" The event was part of Generation Indigenous, or Gen-I, a White House initiative that grew from President Barack Obama and Mrs. Obama's visit last year to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the border between North Dakota and South Dakota. Meetings followed, cabinet members held listening tours, tribal youth were chosen as ambassadors and a national network was formed. The goal is to remove barriers that keep young people from reaching their potential, and a 16-year-old member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe got considerable attention for his efforts. Miguel Wambli created a newspaper to feature writing by Native American students. Seven suicides by teenagers in recent months have shaken the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and close to 1,000 suicide attempts were recorded on the reservation over nearly 10 years. Some students have projects aimed at raising awareness, while Wambli believes a newspaper would give teenagers an outlet. \"I want to try just to help them find their voice and be able to express themselves and be knowledgeable about what's going on in their community,\" he said. Wambli was one of 38 participants from South Dakota, including 13 Oglala Sioux and 10 Rosebud Sioux. Other South Dakota participants were spread among the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, Cheyenne River Sioux, Sicangu Lakota, Fort Peck Dakota, Lower Brule Lakota Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux. Teenagers at the summit represented 230 tribes and 42 states. Discussions focused on economic opportunity, education and cultural and other issues. From New Mexico's pueblos to Midwest reservations, nearly one-third of Native American youths live in poverty, according to federal statistics. They have the highest suicide rates of any ethnicity in the U.S., as well as the lowest high school graduation rates. Michelle Obama recalled hearing \"heart-wrenching stories\" of substance abuse and other crises during last year's visit but said the storytellers were looking to the future, not giving up. She urged the young people to \"draw strength\" from knowing that their customs, values and discoveries are \"at the heart of the American story\" and have shaped U.S. history for centuries. \"Everyone in this room has your back,\" she said. \"Everyone who is speaking at this summit, all those cabinet secretaries, all those powerful people who have come here for you, they have your back. And you definitely have a president and first lady who have your back.\" She also counseled the young people to connect with and \"be inspired by each other,\" and to find out what issues others are working on and to take ideas home with them. \"Run for office. Local office, state office, even president of the United States,\" the first lady said. \"I know you all have it in you.\"",

    "LabBody": "Five years ago, Nebraska bolted the Big 12 for the Big Ten and Colorado departed for the revamped Pac-12. Considering that anniversary, and Oklahoma president David Boren recently raising the issue of the Big 12 needing to expand if it hopes to survive, two questions come to mind: 1. If the Big 12 does expand, when should it do so and what teams should it add? 2. If the Big 12 doesn’t expand, and Boren’s prediction comes true, where would Baylor fall after a Big 12 breakup? Let’s address the first question now. We can ponder the second one for awhile. With all the TV contracts and mutual agreements not ending for another 10 years, there is no rush for the Big 12 to expand. There is still time to see if a university can rise up to the level of Big 12 expectations, including both competitiveness and TV draw. Assuming that the conference is in no rush, then we can suggest keeping some schools on our radar. There are two ways to look at expansion. One is to look around at schools that are interested in moving from a non-Power Five conference into one. The other way is to look at programs in an existing Power Five conference and see if there might be schools interested in making a change. In the former’s case, a non-Power Five school, these are the teams that are most bandied about as a possible addition, in no particular order: BYU, Colorado State, Boise State, Central Florida, Houston and Cincinnati. BYU is attractive because it is a school that has a national footprint and it has a competitive football program. It has a national draw and should be able to hold its own in TV ratings. Not only would they bring in the Salt Lake City market, but they would bring in the Latter Day Saints market across the country. The disadvantage is that BYU is a more religious school than is Baylor. BYU does not play games on Sundays and says it will never do so. There is also the distance between Provo, Utah, and Morgantown, West Virginia. And there is talk that the Cougars rubbed several of the Big 12 presidents the wrong way in earlier discussions about joining the conference. Central Florida has the advantage of opening the Florida TV market to the Big 12 as well as the rich recruiting fields of Florida high school football. As Baylor is all too aware, UCF is competitive in football. It would also add an East Coast neighbor to West Virginia. The disadvantage is that UCF really doesn’t fit the conference in geography and while that isn’t a top priority, it should be considered nonetheless. Cincinnati, Colorado State, Boise State and Houston all have pluses and minuses, but at this point in the game, none is ready to join the Big 12 and be competitive. Cincy would bring in the Ohio markets and there are some good recruits to be had in Ohio, plus the familiarity with West Virginia. Houston isn’t overly appealing because the Big 12 already has the Texas angle covered. If the Big 12 wanted to be daring in adding schools, the league should look at Power Five conferences. Remember, the original realigning of conferences began when the Big Ten suggested it might be interested in adding the University of Texas. Commissioner Bob Bowlsby has said any Big 12 expansion would be with Eastern teams, so why not target teams in the ACC or Big Ten? Florida State sees itself as a football school trapped in a basketball conference and has already made comments about joining the Big 12. Florida State has the same advantages that Central Florida does, only better. Much better. If Florida State could be persuaded to leave the ACC, maybe Clemson would be interested, too. Even Georgia Tech would be an interesting addition to the Big 12. There are rumblings that Nebraska is not really happy with its new home in the Big Ten. The Huskers miss not playing Oklahoma, and Nebraska hasn’t really made the big splash it was supposed to make the Big Ten. The Huskers find themselves playing Wisconsin, Minnesota, Purdue and Illinois far more often than Ohio State or Michigan. Now that the Big 12 has equal distribution of the wealth to all the schools, Nebraska’s big gripe about Texas can be soothed. A Big 12 with Florida State, Clemson, Georgia Tech and Nebraska would be a more formidable conference, and the TV ratings would be very good indeed. The league’s level of competition would be greater in football and men’s basketball. Sure, adding four more teams would end the possibility of a round-robin conference play and the league would be forced to add a conference championship game. But I remember not too long ago, say five years ago, when the Big 12 was griping about how USC never had to play a championship game and so had an easier road into the BCS championship game. Imagine a conference made up of two divisions consisting of the Western Division of Nebraska, Texas Tech, TCU, Baylor, Texas, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State and an Eastern Division of West Virginia, Florida State, Georgia Tech, Clemson, Kansas, Kansas State and Iowa State. The conference could still play nine conference games and there would be no silly talk of the need for a championship game between two teams that already played each other. There would be other schools to consider — it would be fun having Arkansas back in the fold, after all. But if I was going to try to expand the Big 12, my choice would be to raid the ACC and Big Ten. Let them see what it’s like to suddenly have their conferences looking like the gazelle trying to outrun the lion. Survival of the fittest would put the Big 12 in a mighty fit state.",

The site uses a formula to rank posts for individual users based on their behaviors, like whose pictures they like and what stories they comment on — but formulas are not always perfect. “We know that ultimately you’re the only one who truly knows what is most meaningful to you and that is why we want to give you more ways to control what you see,” Product Manager Jacob Frantz wrote in the announcement. The new tools were rolled out to Apple iOS users Thursday and will be available to Android and desktop computer users in the coming weeks. Users can access the new News Feed Preferences panel through their settings menu,. Here’s a sampling of new features: Select friends and Pages to see first: Users will be able to tap on the profile pictures of friends and Pages to see their posts first. Find new Pages to connect to: Based on the types of Pages users have liked, Facebook will create a list of suggestions of other publishers, artists and businesses they might be interested in. Select which friends and Pages to follow or unfollow: For users who are sick of seeing a friend’s posts but do not want to unfriend them, Facebook is making it easier to choose whether to see their updates on their News Feed.

    "LabBody": "In 1959, the Utica Memorial Auditorium was built brick by brick. Come September, however, those 56-year-old bricks will be gone and the exterior of the Aud will look a lot different. The bricks from the concourse roof on up are being removed, and in their place will be rectangular, champagne-colored Alucobond panels that will be aligned to match the curvature of the building. “Matter of fact, we even contacted the original architect of the building to see if he would approve of what we were putting up because we didn’t want to change the look of the building,” said Carl Annese, Upper Mohawk Valley Memorial Auditorium Authority chairman. “He said, ‘Well, I’d be more happy if you put the brick back up.’ But he understood why we couldn’t because of the cost.” Using almost $6 million in state grants, the arena’s renovation project has spanned several years and has included video boards, an Irish pub on the lower concourse, rehabilitated concession stands, a new locker room for the American Hockey League’s Utica Comets and a new parking lot on Whitesboro Street. And more work is planned. Authority officials are working to acquire the former Tartan Textile Services property just east of the auditorium through eminent domain, Annese said. While the property likely would house office and storage space, there is no timeline for a deal, he said. “It all depends on negotiations back and forth with the owner and with us,” Annese said. “You’ve heard of eminent domain going on for a few years or it could go on for a few months. It all depends on both parties involved.” Attempts to contact the property’s owners, Joel and Doug Grimaldi, were unsuccessful. There could, however, be the chance that the property housing the former industrial site is contaminated, said Brian Thomas, the city’s commissioner of urban and economic development, in an email. Since the property previously was a commercial/industrial site and might have some amount of contamination, it would be considered a brownfield site, Thomas said. “However, since I am not aware of any study that confirms the presence of environmental contamination, it is impossible for me to say what might need to be done to the building/site,” Thomas wrote. In the meantime, people will notice several permanent 8-foot steel reinforcement squares going up in certain parts inside and outside the arena to help brace the building, Annese said. The bars will be “basically on the upper level” of the Aud, Annese said, with the outside ones covered by the new material outside of the building and the inside ones hidden by banners in the arena. There also will be some painting and cosmetic work that will take place inside the arena, Annese said. The work was supposed to begin a bit earlier, but the Comets postseason trek into the Calder Cup finals put it on hold. “The Aud’s façade is being replaced to give it a more modern look,” Comets Director of Communications Mark Caswell Jr. said in a statement. “This has been in the plans since the beginning, but has been delayed due to the extended playoff run.” Follow @OD_Gerould on Twitter or call him at 792-4995.",

Sanchez said he returned to San Francisco because it is a \"Sanctuary City,\" and stated that he knew the officials would not be looking for him in regards to his past criminal record. Kate and family were innocently walking on Pier 14, enjoying the day, when Kate dropped to the ground after telling her father, “I don’t feel well,\" not knowing she was struck by a gun shot in the back. Where is the outrage from the citizens of the Bay Area and the mass media? Put yourself or a family member in Jim Steinle’s position, father of Kate, who held his daughter in his arms with Kate pleading “help me Daddy, please help me”, as she bled out from the bullet ripping through her aorta. Ask yourself, are you or anyone else safe in the “Sanctuary City”, besides the protected people. The police chief of San Francisco insisted that the citizens were safe due to the Sanctuary City ordinance. Where is the media asking the police chief to explain why Sanchez was released earlier in the year, and how did the Sanctuary City protect Kate Steinle? You may think that this is an isolated event because no one is reporting otherwise. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, Washington, D.C. (May 28, 2015) – Criminal alien releases are continuing at an alarming pace in 2015 as are the resulting crimes, including rape and murder. “According to ICE records, the agency released 30,558 convicted criminal aliens in 2014. These individuals had been convicted of 79,059 crimes, including 175 homicides, 373 sexual assaults, 186 kidnappings, and 14,014 impaired driving offenses. As the end of March 2015, ICE had released another 10,246 criminal aliens.” As a father myself, my heartfelt grief is overwhelming toward Kate Steinle and family for a preventable tragedy to such innocence in the great Sanctuary City of San Francisco.

Bauso is hopeful the weather behaves the rest of the summer, as she personally booked and promoted a schedule of music she hopes draws crowds to Auburn's parks in droves. With extra money in the city's concert budget, she was given the green light to add a few Wednesday shows at Hoopes Park, as well. \"I'm huge into local music, so this is the highlight of my job,\" she said. Many of the bands have been playing the series for years, Bauso said. New applicants began asking about spots in early spring, and some ended up not making the cut. As the wife of Inside Job and Monster Street Groove member Damian Bauso, Kim knows how important the opportunity is to local musicians, she said. \"Support live local music: That's what allows them to keep going,\" she said. \"It's just part of being out in the community, bringing people together and being in the park with your chair or blanket, and your family. ... It's something that makes Auburn cooler.\" SUMMER 2015 CONCERT SERIES SCHEDULE. • Thursday, July 9 at Market Street Park: Honky Tonk Hindooz. • Tuesday, July 14 at Hoopes Park: Funky Blu Roots followed by movie, \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water\" • Wednesday, July 15 at Hoopes Park: Prison City Rockers. • Thursday, July 16 at Market Street Park: Inside Job. • Tuesday, July 21 at Hoopes Park: The Johnny Rage Band followed by movie, \"The Hero of Color City\" • Wednesday, July 22 at Hoopes Park: Wandering Klezmorim (sponsored by the Schweinfurth Art Center and the New York State Council on the Arts) • Thursday, July 23 at Market Street Park: WoodStone. • Tuesday, July 28 at Hoopes Park: Magical Mystery Tour followed by movie, \"Planes: Fire \u0026 Rescue\" • Wednesday, July 29 at Hoopes Park: Gallows Road Band. • Thursday, July 30 at Market Street Park: Bad JuJu. • Tuesday, Aug. 4 at Hoopes Park: Joe Whiting Band followed by movie, \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\" • Wednesday, Aug. 5 at Hoopes Park: The Buddy Barrette Band. • Thursday, Aug. 6 at Market Street Park: Jam Factor. • Tuesday, Aug. 11 at Hoopes Park: The Shazbot and movie, \"Dolphin Tale 2\" • Thursday, Aug. 13 at Market Street Park: Quickchange. • Tuesday, Aug. 18 at Hoopes Park: Monster Street Groove and movie, \"Paddington\" • Wednesday, Aug. 19 at Hoopes Park: The Fabulous Ripcords. • Thursday, Aug. 20 at Market Street Park: Old Clay Stone. • Tuesday, Aug. 25 at Hoopes Park: Diana Jacobs Band and movie, \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" • Thursday, Aug. 27 at Market Street Park: Lock 52 Jazz Band.

    "LabBody": "A Casper woman who pleaded guilty Thursday to breaking her 8-month-old baby’s arm because she was frustrated could avoid prison time under a plea agreement with prosecutors. Natrona County District Judge Catherine Wilking said she has “serious concerns” about the plea agreement with Kelsey Steed and may reject it at sentencing. Prosecutors said Steed’s child, when taken to the hospital in August, had several older fractures in various stages of healing, pointing toward a pattern of abuse. Steed, 20, entered an Alford plea to one count of child abuse. An Alford plea means she does not admit to the crime but acknowledges that prosecutors have enough evidence to convince a jury she is guilty. Under the agreement, Steed faces up to one year in jail or probation, or a combination of the two. Casper police began investigating the abuse after Steed took her daughter to the emergency room at Wyoming Medical Center. Hospital employees called authorities because they believed the girl’s injuries were caused by abuse. Steed told police she brought her daughter to the hospital because the baby wasn’t moving her right arm. She repeatedly told officers she had not intentionally hurt her child, the documents state. The doctor told police that four bone fractures to the 8-month-old’s arm and leg occurred at different times because they were in different stages of healing, according to the documents. The doctor also reported that it would have taken a great deal of force to break the bones. Steed eventually admitted to officers that she had been frustrated with her daughter on the morning she took the infant to the hospital. Steed said she was “stressed out and frustrated” that her daughter had woken about 2 a.m. She said she had been rough with the child when she picked her up. The doctor also informed police that the baby had been at the hospital two months earlier for a torn esophagus and had been taken by helicopter to the children’s hospital in Denver. The cause of the tear had not been determined. Steed is being held in the Natrona County Detention Center on bond pending her sentencing hearing.

    "LabBody": "Methodology. Companies are ranked by total revenues for their respective fiscal years. Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years' data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K. Revenues. Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spinoff is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks and savings institutions are interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. Profits. Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2013 profits to 2014 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting. Balance Sheet. Assets are the company’s year-end total. Total stockholders’ equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company’s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company’s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity. Employees. The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee. Earnings Per Share. The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company’s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded. Total Return to Investors. Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company’s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2014 of stock owned at the end of 2004, 2009, and 2013. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spinoffs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded. Medians. No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2013 to 2014 do not include companies that lost money in 2013 or lost money in both 2013 and 2014, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases. Credits. This Fortune 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Richard K. Tucksmith and Rhona Altschuler. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, she used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S\u0026P Capital IQ to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support. Edith Fried reviewed and edited nonstatistical information. Researchers Viki Goldman and Kathleen Lyons assisted with the data gathering and verification. The data verification process was aided substantially by information provided by S\u0026P Capital IQ. Other sources used were: FactSet Research Systems, Hoover’s and Morningstar Document Research.",

    "LabBody": "Texas health officials confirmed the state’s first case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome this year in a resident of the Texas Panhandle. The Texas Department of State Health Services reminds people to protect themselves from the virus that causes HPS. Although the person recovered from the infection, HPS is often severe and sometimes fatal. Hantavirus is carried by certain species of rats and mice that shed the virus in their urine, droppings and saliva. The virus can be transmitted to people when infected rat or mouse urine, droppings, saliva or nesting materials are stirred up, allowing the virus to be breathed in by humans. The illness is rare, but HPS cases are frequently associated with spring cleaning. DSHS recommends the following precautions: • Seal openings that may allow rats and mice to enter homes and workplaces. • Remove brush, woodpiles, trash and other items that may attract rats and mice. • Tightly close garbage cans, pet food containers, and other food sources. • Before cleaning up nests or droppings found inside, open windows and doors to ventilate the area for at least 30 minutes. • If any dust will be stirred up, goggles and a HEPA or N-95 mask are recommended. • Wear protective gloves to handle dead mice and rats or to clean up nesting areas, urine or droppings. • Do not stir up dust by sweeping or vacuuming. Dampen areas before cleanup with either a 1-to-10 bleach-water mixture or another effective disinfectant, in order to eliminate dust and begin inactivating the virus. After 30 minutes, apply the mixture again and immediately begin the cleaning process. • Use the same bleach mixture or disinfectant and apply to dead rodents, nests, urine and droppings before cleaning with the same 30-minute interval and reapplication process. Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fatigue, fever and muscle aches. These symptoms may be accompanied by headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath. If hantavirus infection is suspected, people should contact their health care provider immediately and inform the practitioner of exposure to rodents, their waste and/or nesting material. Including this case, a total of 45 HPS cases have been confirmed in Texas since 1993. Half of the reported cases were residents of the Panhandle or South Plains areas. Of the 45 cases, 15 resulted in death.",

Mr. Obama will become the first president to visit a federal prison when he travels Thursday to the El Reno federal prison in Oklahoma, the White House said Friday.The president will visit the medium-security prison near Oklahoma City to talk about criminal justice reform, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. While there, he’s expected to commute the sentences of dozens of federal inmates who are in jail on drug charges. The prison visit will come just two days after Mr. Obama travels to Philadelphia, where he’ll address the NAACP’s annual conference on the need for criminal justice reform and outline “the unfairness” of the system, Mr. Earnest said. The president’s visit will be recorded for an HBO documentary to be aired later this year, according to VICE Media. Mr. Obama and VICE founder Shane Smith, host of the special, will tour the facility and meet with prisoners, prison staff, and law enforcement officials, the company said. El Reno houses about 1,300 inmates. The interviews will be “part of a broader HBO documentary looking at the pervasive impacts of America’s approach to crime and imprisonment, chronicling the many interlocking pieces of the sprawling system, from prisoners and their families to the judiciary and community reformers,” VICE Media said.",

    "LabBody": "After a run of four games in 10 days, an off week came at the right time for the Wilmington Hammerheads. Coach Carson Porter made sure the team got plenty of rest as well, with only three practices this week before hitting the home stretch of the USL season. After trips to Richmond, Montreal, Toronto and Harrisburg in the past five games, recovery was at the top of the priority list. \"We had the four games, and an overnight bus ride in there,\" Porter said at the end of Thursday's session at Legion Stadium. \"Sometimes, less is more.\" The Hammerheads, tied for 10th in the 12-team USL Eastern Conference, only hope the break gives a stalwart defense time to refresh, while also providing more time for new forwards and midfielders to create chemistry. Wilmington hasn't allowed more than one goal in a game over its past nine outings -- and gone 1-4-4 because it's only scored four times in that stretch. \"The defending has been quite good,\" Porter said, \"but everyone's feeling the weight to score goals. Not just the forwards, the midfield, the defense. It's the entire team.\" Sight seeing. The team's returns to action next Saturday at Charleston, a rivalry game in one of the team's favorite venues, Blackbaud Stadium. The two-game swing through Canada, however, provided some new experiences, from finding a bus company in another country, to playing in new places. \"We really enjoyed playing the big stadiums in Canada,\" Porter said of the matches in Montreal's Saputo Stadium and Toronto's BMO Field. \"Everyone gets excited for games like that.\" You and Q. The team's trade for Seattle forward Qudus Lawal hasn't resulted in many minutes yet for the teenager, but expect that to change in the coming weeks. Lawal, the 19-year-old who arrived the week of June 14, has only played in one of four potential matches for the Hammers. \"Guys like (Qudus), he's in the conversation now for the first 11, and off the bench he has fantastic energy,\" Porter said. \"You'll see him in a bigger role. \"Being in a new culture is a change, but those guys are getting sorted out and in a good place.\" Contact Dan Spears at 910-343-2038 or Dan.Spears@StarNewsOnline.com.",

    "LabBody": "Spartanburg County students spent the week learning about technology and entrepreneurship at a camp sponsored by the Governor's School for Science and Mathematics. The iTeams Xtreme camp at Carver Middle School involved 39 students developing mobile apps, designing models using 3-D printers and programming and coding software. “I kind of didn't want to go, but once I got here and started doing some of the work, it was really interesting and fun,” said Tayler Tyson, a McCracken Middle School student. Tyson and her partners, Makayla Hamms and Mercy Porter, were one of several groups that built an app for Android devices. “It's a real opportunity to exercise their minds,” said Randy LaCrosse, vice president of outreach and research with the Governor's School. “It provides something that's challenging and fun, while letting them think outside the box.” LaCrosse said gearing technology programs to middle school students has proven to spark their interest in science, technology and engineering. “Today, some groups got to meet with business folks, and that was a unique opportunity,” he said. “They got to pitch their ideas. It is very real world.” This was the second straight year the iTeams Xtreme camp was held in Spartanburg County, said Jennifer McCormack, the Governor's School director of development. “We've seen some very talented teachers and students in Spartanburg County,” she said. “The students have really dug into the programs and technology we have let them work with.” Thursday was the camp's finale. Students were able to present their creations to their peers, science teachers, and family members who came to support them. Tyson said her love of science and her experience during the week made her appreciate the apps she has on her smartphone even more. She said getting to spend a week working with technology, even during the summer, was worth it. “I've gotten to learn how to build and program apps,” she said. “I feel like I can work with technology better now.” More from Zach Fox: Twitter | Articles.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "FORT FISHER -- Since mid-June, a few concerned visitors at the Fort Fisher State Historic Site have asked about the future of the confederate flag. Site director Jim Steele said as a national debate swirls about the flag's value, some Civil War aficionados are worried they will have trouble finding flags. \"The sales have had an uptick,\" he said. \"A handful of people have wondered because the National Parks Service discontinued sales of confederate flag merchandise.\" But the flags will not be disappearing from gift shops run by the N.C. Division of State Historic Sites and Properties, including Fort Fisher. Officials say merchandise displaying the confederate emblem tells an important part of North Carolina history, and the flags are contextualized in museum shops. On June 25, the National Park Service announced it would pull the flags from its book stores and gift shops, following similar decisions by retailers including Walmart, Sears, eBay and Amazon. The move came days after a shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., that killed nine people; the Department of Justice has opened a hate-crime investigation. In a news release, park service director Jonathan Jarvis said the shooting \"galvanized a national discussion that includes symbols and relics from our nation’s past such as the Confederate Battle Flag.\" But not all merchandise bearing the flag will be affected: The decision applies only to stand-alone depictions, certain wearable items and merchandise where the flag can be detached. Items that show the flag in a historic context, such as books and DVDs, can still be sold. At Gettysburg National Military Park, 11 items out of the book store's 2,600-item inventory were pulled, according to the park service. North Carolina Historic Sites director Keith Hardison said confederate flags are part of the educational experience at state-run Civil War sites. \"At this time, there is no indication that we will stop selling that merchandise at the sites,\" he said. Steele said merchandise at the Fort Fisher gift shop includes a variety of historic confederate and union battle flags. \"Everything we do here we try to keep in in a historical context and just try to tell the story of the soldiers that fought here and tell the story of the battle,\" he said. \"We try to avoid the politics of it.\" Contact Cammie Bellamy at Cammie.Bellamy@StarNewsOnline.com or 910-343-2339.",

    "LabBody": "St. Louis this month gained a new public company and a new corporate name with the successful split of Energizer Holdings into two consumer products giants. The company that kept the Energizer name is focused on batteries and lighting products, and remains based in Town and Country. The other, Edgewell Personal Care, took over more than two dozen consumer brands, many sold around the globe, including Schick razors, Banana Boat sunscreen and Wet Ones hand wipes. That portfolio of personal care brands generated $2.6 billion in sales last year. Based in Chesterfield, Edgewell employs 6,000 people, including 175 locally. David Hatfield, the new chief executive of Edgewell, took a moment last week to reflect on the massive, yearlong undertaking that created two companies, and the strategy that will guide his company going forward. Most spinoffs involve only a small fraction of a company, Hatfield said in an interview. But the separation of Energizer’s household and personal care divisions was nearly a 50-50 split, ratcheting up the complexity of the task. “We divided a company across 50-plus countries,” he said. “Folks have done a superb job, and we’re looking forward to a new beginning.” Hatfield didn’t stop to ruminate on the past for long, however. Edgewell is putting a bigger priority on international growth than it did previously, he said, and the company is investing heavily in innovation to develop new products. Acquisitions — a critical part of the company’s prior growth — will help propel the company’s global growth, he added. Hatfield started at Eveready’s battery division in 1988, 12 years before Energizer and the Eveready brand were spun off from Ralston Purina Co. During his career, he helped oversee several major acquisitions as Energizer diversified beyond its battery base, including purchasing the Schick-Wilkinson Sword razor business in 2003 for $930 million and the $1.9 billion acquisition of Playtex Products in 2007. With the battery division now a separate company, Edgewell can focus on its core business, personal care products, Hatfield said. “We compete in attractive categories and we have strong brands,” he said. In addition to Schick razors and Edge and Skintimate shaving preparation products that account for 61 percent of Edgewell’s sales, Edgewell’s brands include Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen, and Playtex and o.b. tampons. Feminine care and sun/skin care each account for about 16 percent of sales, with infant and other products totaling 7 percent of sales. “We’ve been built through acquisitions over time,” Hatfield said. “We have a legacy of disciplined M\u0026A and we look to continue that going forward. Our philosophy is we look to stay close to our core. We’re going to look at businesses in categories we compete in, particularly in suncare, and adjacencies such as skin care and grooming.” RAZOR FOCUS. With razors and shaving prep products accounting for more than half of its business, the segment is Edgewell’s No. 1 focus, Hatfield said. Edgewell’s wet shave net sales totaled $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014, with 45 percent of sales in North America, 28 percent in Europe, 19 percent in Asia and 8 percent in Latin America.“Management will be relying on increased investment behind the growth brands, innovation, leveraging of the entire portfolio (including private label), and international expansion, particularly in developing markets,” John Faucher, a J.P. Morgan analyst, wrote in a recent research note. Procter \u0026 Gamble’s Gillette is the market leader for razors in the U.S., followed by Edgewell’s Schick brand. Both Gillette and Schick face increasing competition from Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club, which are growing their online razor sales. Hatfield said he’s watching the online competitors closely.“That’s an interesting phenomenon that we have to watch,” he said, adding that most online competitors aren’t profitable and are burning through cash. If the online competitors survive, Hatfield said Edgewell’s private label razor business could act as suppliers. “We’re positioned well to help them,” he said.

    "DiffbotBody": "The world is sometimes a difficult place, and sometimes while we suffer in darkness, we wonder if God has left us alone. When you find yourself questioning if God has abandoned you, remember these seven important comforting truths. Difficulties and trials are a part of every traveler's journey in life. Sometimes they make us and other times they break us and piece us together into something different. Either way, we come out of these difficulties a different person than we were when we went in. That is the nature of trials. Read: Be still and know that I am God: 10 ways to recognize God's power in times of trouble Some may turn to God in their difficulties, but what happens when we feel that God has abandoned us and forced us to face the darkness alone? Here are seven things to remember when you feel like God has abandoned you. God loves you God is your father, and He loves you with a love that is perfect and unending. You can trust in that. Because you are His child, He cares for you, watches over you, protects you and even mourns with you. We are put here in families with parents so we can understand the bond between parent and child. That love is only a fraction of the love your Heavenly Father feels for you. In the scriptures we are told that charity never faileth. Charity is pure love, and God's love will never fail you. Learn to love Him too so you can more fully feel His love around you. Sometimes a good cry is necessary Sometimes the anger and hate of the world is so painful that we harden our hearts so we can't feel the pain. The trouble with closing our hearts to pain is that once it's closed, love is also locked out. A good cry can help fix what sometimes needs to be broken. The pain and sorrow of a broken heart leaves spaces that God can fill –- that you can feel. A broken heart allows you to cry over the pain and sorrow of your trials, and allows God's love to heal the broken parts. In order for you to know God is there, you have to be able to feel His presence. God will come to you if you ask Often when we feel abandoned, the last thing we want to do is talk to the one who we feel has betrayed us. When it comes to God, however, the best thing you can do is talk to Him and tell Him how you feel. As your father, He wants to hear from you as often as you are willing to let Him be a part of your life. Not only will God listen to every prayer you speak, but He will come to you every time you ask for Him. He may not answer every prayer exactly the way you would like Him to, and He may not answer them immediately, but He will sit with you and comfort you while you wait. If you want God to walk with you, it's important that you talk to Him. Just ask. God sees the end from the beginning Because we are small human beings in a big world, we are so limited in our ability to see beyond what's right in front of us. God, on the other hand, is a supreme being, the creator of the universe, and more importantly, the creator of us. He knows where you're broken and where you need mending. He also knows the experiences needed to heal you. Each trial is part of the perfecting process so when we stand before Him, we can be our best selves. We do not see what He sees nor can we know what He knows. What we can do is trust that each experience He gives us is given to help us grow, to give us experience and to point us in the direction we need to go. Trust Him. God is a God of goodness Everything that is good comes from God. By the same token, everything that comes from God is good, even the hard things. If God is asking you to walk a certain path, know that it is for your good, for your better understanding and for your learning. God wouldn't require you to do something that was going to damage your soul. He is a God that desires to lift you up and make you better than you are. Sometimes, it is our own choices that put us in situations that are dangerous. When you find yourself in any situation that is not good, get out! God will not be there. God is a God of goodness and you will find Him in places of light. If you want to find God, look for those places of light and walk there. We're not meant to suffer alone Isolation can cause loneliness, discouragement and depression. It can rob people of their hope, their will and their self-worth. Trusted friends, on the other hand, can encourage, support, and ground us. They can guide us through troubled waters, offer a hand to hold and cheer us up when our hearts are heavy. A trusted friend can remind us of who we are and where we want to be. Some have been where we are before and can give us a far better perspective on how to travel safely to the other side. A good friend is God's way of sending an angel. Read: 4 reasons atheists and Christians both need to be extremely concerned about this new study God never abandons His children God is a God of love and a God of light. He is also our true father, a father who will never abandon His children. Although the world's fathers may, at times, fail their children, God is perfect and will never ever fail you. You are his precious, beautiful child and although He may at times test you, He will never, ever forsake you. Of this promise you can be sure. Believe in Him and keep moving forward.",

Devon Staples and his friends had been drinking and setting off fireworks Saturday night in the backyard of a friend's home in eastern Maine, said Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety. Staples, 22, of Calais, a small city on the Canadian border, placed a reloadable fireworks mortar tube on his head and told his friends he was going to light it, McCausland said. But his friends urged him to stop. \"Apparently, he thought that was a great idea,\" McCausland said. \"His friends they thought dissuaded him from doing it, and the next thing they knew, he ignited the fireworks and he was killed instantly.\" Staples's brother Cody told the Daily News of New York that he was a few feet away when his brother lit the firework and was the first to come to his side after it exploded. \"There was no rushing him to the hospital. There was no Devon left when I got there,\" said 25-year-old Cody Staples, who called it an accident. \"Devon was not the kind of person who would do something stupid. He was the kind of person who would pretend to do something stupid to make people laugh,\" he said. Staples' death is the first fireworks fatality in Maine since the state legalized fireworks on Jan. 1, 2012, authorities said. Lawmakers had voted to repeal a 1949 law banning fireworks, reasoning the industry would create jobs and generate revenue. State fire marshals were also investigating several other Fourth of July fireworks accidents involving injuries in Friendship, Jefferson, Lebanon and Woodstock. They said most of the accidents involved burns and eye injuries. In Montana on Saturday, a 32-year-old man was killed at a Billings home in a fireworks accident involving a mortar tube. And in New Jersey, a 52-year-old man blew off a large piece of his left leg below the knee when he set off a tennis-ball sized firework in Leonia.",

    "LabBody": "Too often, it seems like the most important subjects are the hardest to talk about. Take autism for example. Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that one in 68 children has an autism spectrum disorder, many students shy away from approaching the topic. The fear of “saying the wrong thing” leads some to ignore or even ostracize autistic peers. In fact, 63 percent of autistic children report being bullied, according to a 2012 study from the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore and John Hopkins University. Understanding is the first step to acceptance. Here’s what you need to know about autism. Crash course: What is autism? Autism is a layman’s term for a class of neuro-developmental disorders known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The severity of autism falls on a spectrum: Some people might be mildly autistic and never diagnosed, while others suffer from severe autism and require special accommodations throughout their lives. Autism is a neurological disorder, not a physical or emotional disorder, meaning that you can’t infer autism by looking at someone. According to The Arc, an educational resource that helps the general population understand autism, the three most common behaviors associated with those on the spectrum are social deficits, communication problems and repetitive or restricted behaviors. However, it’s important not to over-generalize certain behaviors. “Everyone is unique,” said Sarah Spencer, a learning behavior specialist and the department chair of special education at Walter Payton College Prep in Chicago. “Autism is a spectrum, a range of things. The more time you spend with (autistic peers), the more you discover what’s cool with them and what’s not — just like any other friend you’d have.” According to Ali Watters, director of Family Service Projects at Autism Speaks, it’s crucial to keep an open mind. “It is important to think of (these students) as intelligent, even if language or behavioral difficulties do not reveal abilities in the way you expect,” she said. What causes the disorder? Experts are wondering the same thing and raising millions of dollars annually to find out. Reach out. To cut down on the percentage of autistic youth who are bullied every year, it’s important to reach out and be inclusive. Our experts had some helpful tips for those who are ready to extend a hand. —Make the first move. “Initiating (conversation) can be hard for some of our kids,” Spencer said. Be inclusive and smile. —Don’t be dissuaded. “Because a two-way conversation can be hard for a person with autism, try redirecting the conversation,” Spencer said, adding that you shouldn’t be deterred by confusing body language. “Their body language might be sending one message, but their intention could be totally different.” —Be consistent. “Set clear expectations and boundaries,” Watters said. Those with autism prefer order and stability, so try not to change plans or introduce surprises. —Don’t make it different. “Treat them like a human being, like every other person,” Spencer added. Be an upstander. Though data shows many autistic students are bullied, it’s often difficult for them to communicate and speak up against their bullies. If you see something, say something. Be a voice-box for any student who needs an advocate. Simply tell the bully that his or her snide remarks aren’t cool. If the situation gets out of hand, talk to an adult right away. Better yet, be a Best Buddy! Best Buddies is an international nonprofit that fosters one-to-one friendships between students with developmental disabilities and those without. Spencer is the adult leader of Walter Payton’s chapter. “It’s a social club,” she said. “We hang out, play games, go to movies, have dances — all with a little more structure so our kids on the spectrum aren’t stressed out. It’s a safe way to make friends.” Best Buddies is a two-way street: “It gives you a broader perspective and helps you learn more about yourself,” Spencer added.

Chock-full of visual aids to encourage relaxation and self-soothing, AETAS also arms users with a time perspective inventory that helps them understand how they view the past, present, and future will either help or hinder their happiness. ($4.99; iOS) Sometimes, all we need to de-stress is take a few deep breaths. Created by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, this app teaches users how to do diaphragmatic breathing. Features include educational videos on the stress response, logs to record stress levels, and customizable guided breathing sessions. (Free; iOS and Android) This app works as a daily mood and thought diary. But it also has a coaching module that gives tips on sticky emotional situations, like how to ask for what you need without drama or how to successfully resolve conflict. And users get positive reinforcement when they're consistent with their entries. The app also includes a super helpful DBT reference section for more info on coping skills—all backed by research.

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "(CNSNew.com) – Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy said on Tuesday that if the United States leads a global battle against climate change, then 69,000 premature deaths would be prevented in the year 2100. Commenting on the EPA’s forecast, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said, “If we want to talk about pre-mature deaths, how about the 57 million innocent unborn children whose lives have been stolen since Roe v. Wade?” A new report from the EPA, Climate Change in the United States: Benefits of Global Action, “shows the benefits of the United States taking action and global action on climate change, and the benefits are very dramatic; if the world acts now it will prevent up to 69,000 premature deaths in the U.S. in the year 2100 alone from poor air quality and extreme heat,” McCarthy said at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington, D.C. “And, of course, if we fail to act, the reverse is true -- in sectors from manufacturing to agriculture to fishing,” said McCarthy. “We’ll save billions of dollars if we act now. We will lose billions of dollars and human lives if we fail to act.” The June 22, 2015 EPA report states that in the year 2100 as many as 57,000 premature deaths could be prevented from poor air quality. The report also states that an additional 12,000 “fewer deaths” would occur in 2100 because of extreme heat. “The number that McCarthy cited includes two health sectors that we analyzed for changes in premature mortality: climate change impacts on air quality and climate change impacts on extreme temperature,” an EPA spokesperson told CNSNews.com. The 69,000 number cited by McCarthy comes from combining the estimated 57,000 premature deaths prevented and the 12,000 “fewer deaths.” However, at least one expert disagrees with the premise made in the report that would lead to the predicted deaths from poor air quality and extreme heat. Marlo Lewis, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, wrote an analysis of the report last week entitled, EPA’s Climate Action Flim-Flam Report. In the EPA’s actual report, Lewis notes, a scenario is presented of what will happen if no action is taken to stop climate change, claiming that the global temperature will increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit between 2010 and 2100 and even higher in the United States, from 14 degrees Fahrenheit in the Mountain West to 12 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern regions. “How reasonable is it, though, to suppose that average global temperatures in 2100 will be 9°F higher than they are today?” Lewis wrote. “Not very.” “Over the past 36 years, the lower troposphere (roughly 0-25,000 feet) has warmed at a rate of 0.114°C/decade, according to the latest University of Alabama in Huntsville satellite temperature record. That translates into another 2.2ºF of warming by 2100, not 9ºF,” Lewis wrote. “Things could change, of course,” Lewis wrote. “Nonetheless, there’s no empirical data to back up EPA’s assumption that the warming rate over the next 85 years will increase by 400%,” which would result in thousands of premature or avoidable deaths cited in the EPA report. The EPA’s report also defies scientific data on deaths from extreme heat, according to Lewis. “Even if the planet were warming as fast as EPA imagines, the agency’s impact projections would still be dubious,” Lewis wrote. “For example, EPA estimates that in the ‘no action’ scenario, heat stress will kill an additional 12,000 Americans in 49 cities in 2100 (p. 26). “But only about 2,000 U.S. residents die each year from all forms of extreme weather, with about 31% attributed to exposure to extreme heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control,” Lewis wrote. “So currently about 620 annual U.S. deaths are heat-related, and U.S. heat-related mortality has been declining, decade-by-decade, since the 1960s, despite rising urban summer air temperatures.” Lewis also sheds doubt on the predicted deaths from poor air quality cited in the EPA report. “EPA claims global action would avoid approximately 13,000 premature U.S. deaths in 2050 and 57,000 in 2100 from poor air quality, the theory being that warming will increase ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution (p. 27),” Lewis wrote. “However, it is far from clear that ozone and PM2.5 pose significant health risks at today’s historically low levels,” he said. “Moreover, as EPA data show, U.S. air pollution emissions and concentrations keep declining despite global warming,” Lewis wrote. Meanwhile, on Wednesday the U.S. Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing: “Road to Paris: Examining the President’s International Climate Agenda and Implications for Domestic Environmental Policy.” Sen. James Inhofe, chairman of the committee, was asked by CNSNews.com about EPA Administrator McCarthy’s remarks about preventing premature deaths by fighting climate change. “If we want to talk about pre-mature deaths, how about the 57 million innocent unborn children whose lives have been stolen since Roe v. Wade?” Inhofe said, referring to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Rhody Ridge is still Fir Butler's home. She and her late husband, Merlin, put a lifetime of toil into the wooded garden near Bothell. It was theirs, but they cultivated it for everyone.“When you love the land as we have, you want it to continue long past your own life,” the 84-year-old widow said Monday.Sitting in her cozy house on what is now Snohomish County Parks property, Butler talked about her love of nature and the legacy she and her husband have left for generations.It was the late 1950s when they bought the logged-off acreage that is now Rhody Ridge Arboretum. By 1970, they had deeded their 5.7 acres to Snohomish County for a park. In the years since, the county purchased another six acres for the nearly 12-acre arboretum, which is east of North Road near Mill Creek.The Butlers planted and maintained Rhody Ridge, a job too big for a frail octogenarian.Merlin Butler died in January. He was 90. His widow is now back home after an injury a couple of years ago. After falling from a ladder while pruning trees, she was in a care facility for some time.“I've always been so happy working outside,” said Butler, who is helped by a care giver. She hopes to soon resume gardening.Raised in the “flat, dry lands of Texas,” Butler said she fell in love with Western Washington on a trip here as a teenager. After marrying in 1953, the Butlers moved here for life. They didn't have children. With a love of the mountains, they spent free time hiking the Cascades. Butler is still thrilled by memories of hiking with her husband and their German shepherds.Merlin Butler was a pharmaceutical salesman, but his second career was helping create Rhody Ridge. “The entire object was to create a park,” Butler said. A hidden gem, the arboretum has been toured by garden groups and college students.Help maintaining it has come from several sources, including a newly formed Rhody Ridge Foundation. Members of the nonprofit group, among them Butler's neighbors Diana and Pat Riley, hold monthly work parties.On June 29, the Seattle-based organization PlantAmnesty donated a day of pruning services at Rhody Ridge. Katy Dittmer, the nonprofit's general manager, said six arborists met Butler and pruned the trees.And Tom Murdoch, a naturalist with Snohomish County Parks, has also worked at Rhody Ridge, at times with jail crews.Named for rhododendrons the Butlers grew from seedlings, the arboretum is also a lush haven of tall evergreens, native cedars and firs. Most spectacular in spring and fall, it has magnolias, dogwood, Japanese maples and crab apple trees. Tasks include pruning, trail grooming and “dead-heading” old blooms off rhody plants.Roberta Riley, Pat Riley's sister, has joined in the work parties. “I'm learning Fir's love and wisdom about plants. She is a charming person,” she said.Diana and Pat Riley bought their house next to the Butlers nearly 20 years ago. Now, they work at Rhody Ridge nearly every day. In the past year, they cleared weeds from all the trails, Diana Riley said.An attorney, Roberta Riley explained that the Butlers deeded their land to the county for a park, but retained the right to live there the rest of their lives.Russ Bosanko, the county's division manager of park operations and community partnerships, said the home and property are now valued at $702,400. The county bought an adjoining five acres in 1973 for $22,000, and another acre in 1989 for $33,000. When the Butlers arrived, there were few homes nearby. “Their whole thought was to have this space open to the public,” Bosanko said.Richard Fairfield, of Snohomish, is president of the Rhody Ridge Foundation, which was recently granted nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service. A member of the American Rhododendron Society's Pilchuck Chapter, Fairfield met Fir Butler years ago during an arboretum tour.“A lot of these bigger estate gardens have foundations that either own or run them,” Fairfield said. Before the Butlers came, he said, “it was a stump farm — stumps and blackberries as far as the eye could see.”Now, it's a unique place of beauty. “There are so many rhododendrons, and they're so big and beautiful. There are crosses there that were never registered, one-of-a-kind specimens,” Fairfield said.Snohomish County Parks Director Tom Teigen said that with 107 parks to care for, the department uses many volunteers to help maintain trails, beaches and other sites. With the new foundation in partnership with the county, he hopes to see the Butlers' vision preserved.Teigen appreciates the couple's foresight. As development fills once open space, he has seen other estates become parks. “We're really blessed as a county. A lot of people over the years gave big gifts,” he said.For Butler, the sacrifice was a pleasure.“We had fallen in love with the wonderful landscape out here. We worked side by side for years,” she said. “We knew exactly what we wanted to do.”Julie Muhlstein: 425-339-3460; jmuhlstein@heralndet.com.How to helpTo join in monthly work parties at Rhody Ridge Arboretum, email Rhody Ridge Foundation president Richard Fairfield: wineryduck@yahoo.comLearn about Rhody Ridge at:http://bit.ly/1HLelsJ",

Peterson, who was best known for appearing in the 1987 romantic comedy, was found dead in her home in Greeley, Colorado on July 5. She was just 43 and is survived by her husband and two children. Police do not suspect foul play. Her father told TMZ that Peterson suffered from several medical issues, including sleep apnea and sinusitis. Fans flooded social media following her death, and Dempsey also paid tribute to the star, writing on Twitter: \"In my memory, she will always be vibrant and young. Gone too soon. Sending my thoughts and prayers to Amanda's family.\" In my memory, she will always be vibrant and young. Gone too soon. Sending my thoughts and prayers to Amanda's family. — Patrick Dempsey (@PatrickDempsey) July 7, 2015. Celebrities such as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lance Bass and Meredith Salenger also paid tribute to the fallen star. Peterson quit show business in 1994. She also appeared in the shortly lived TV series \"Boone,\" \"A Year in the Life\" and \"Jack's Place.\"",

The mega-trailer made its debut in the second half of the two-hour joint panel for The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead at San Diego Comic Con 2015 and it did not disappoint. For starters, we really get a feel of what L.A. was like just before the start of the apocalypse and it’s fascinating to watch as our core group of characters — boyfriend/girlfriend duo Travis (Cliff Curtis) and Madison (Kim Dickens), and Madison’s kids Nick (Frank Dillane) and Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey) — react to the ever-changing world around them. One thing that’s really awesome is the fact that we viewers have an advantage over the characters we’re watching, since we know more about this world than they do. As you can see in the trailer, Madison believes her son Nick is high when he first starts talking about seeing walkers. Even the police are ill-informed as they shoot them in the abdomen rather than the head — which fans know is what kills them instantly. At one point a panicked Madison, who is with her kids but has been separated from Travis, realizes, “This thing is getting worse.” You’re a quick study, girl. The trailer ends with this ominous, but fitting message: “When civilization ends, it ends fast.”Fear the Walking Dead premieres August 23, 2015 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC. 07.10.2015 / 06:13 PM EDT by Samantha Leffler Related: The Walking Dead Spinoff, The Walking Dead, News, TV",

    "LabBody": "POIPU — Steve May, son Alex and daughter Ellie were delighted when they sat down at Table 53 at RumFire Poipu Beach Friday. It promised to be a wonderful evening of great food, conversation and spectacular ocean views. What made it even better, though, was knowing their dinner tab was going to support the Kauai Humane Society. “We donate to the humane society back where we live so we think it’s a great a thing, that they do this for the humane society here,” the California resident said. “We love animals as a family and so it’s fantastic for the restaurant to contribute to that cause.” Since October 2012, the food and beverage proceeds from Table 53 at the RumFire have been donated to local charities. The concept has been wildly successful and recently hit the $100,000 mark to support programs that serve the island in various ways from feeding the hungry, nurturing keiki and taking care of kupuna. “We want to extend a warm mahalo to our island ohana who dined with us at Table 53 over the past two years,” said Chip Bahouth, Sheraton Kauai general manager. “We are proud to support the many worthy programs within our island community.” Jason Watson, Sheraton restaurants and bar manager, said as someone new to the island, it was almost shocking to see and hear about all the community outreach at the Sheraton Kauai. “When I first learned about Table 53, the program was benefiting the American Cancer Society’s Hoedown for Hope,” he said. “I had just found out my sister had been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and was fighting for her life. I started to get emotional because it was too big of a coincidence.” Kelvin Moniz, executive director for the Kauai Independent Food Bank, said the contributions from Table 53 have a big impact on the food bank’s ability to help others. “We have been the beneficiary of Table 53 during times when our food drives were not active,” Moniz said. “The proceeds have helped us keep the programs such as the Keiki Cafe and backpack programs going. We at the Kauai Independent Food Bank definitely appreciate the help from the Sheraton Kauai and Table 53.” The Hawaii Foodbank, Kauai Branch has also received help from Table 53. The Sheraton Kauai has also contributed two vehicles from its fleet to the Hawaii Foodbank. “When I think back on the past years the program has been in place, one of the most impactful moments for me, personally, was when we benefited the ALS Association, Golden West Chapter, which assists people and families affected by the disease,” said June Cappiello, Sheraton’s director of public relations. “There are several families affected by this disease on Kauai and I had the opportunity to meet some of them during a check presentation. They shared some of the challenges they faced, including not being able to get all of the equipment they needed to help them live a more comfortable life.” Table 53 is one of the stations which is always used, Cappiello said, and averages between $3,000 and $4,000 a month for the recipient nonprofit. “If there are no reservations for it, guests are always shown to that table because of its views, and, as Jason says, its perfect alignment to enjoy the Kauai sunsets,” she said. Watson said he stops at Table 53 every night to thank guests enjoying the table for participating and explains how much it meant to him. “I connected with a woman from Wyoming at Table 53 who had the same cancer my sister has, and is in remission,” Watson said. “She made contact with my sister and now, they speak frequently. I have a very strong connection to Table 53.” Patrons interested in participating in RumFire’s Table 53 program can make reservations by calling 742-4786. Proceeds during July will benefit the Kauai Humane Society. ••• The Garden Island reporter Averie Soto contributed to this story.",

    "LabBody": "The military’s plan to shrink the size of the Army — which will reduce spending by several billion dollars — will not affect the island of Kauai, Army officials said Thursday. The Army announced Wednesday that a cut of 40,000 active duty soldiers will result in savings of $7 billion over the course of four years: a reduction that will bring the Army’s numbers down to 450,000. “It shouldn’t affect Kauai at all,” said Dennis Drake, Schofield Barracks director of public affairs. “We don’t train over there; we don’t have any soldiers over there.” However, the Army said it will reduce the number of soldiers at Schofield Barracks on Oahu by 1,200, as the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team will become an infantry brigade combat team. “The Army is an integral part of our community, and I am pleased that the announced reductions are not as severe as they might have been,” Gov. David Ige said in statement Thursday. “We continue to monitor the potential loss of some of our civilian workforce and an additional round of planned reductions in 2017. My administration will make the retention of our current force levels a priority.” U.S. Army Pacific said the changes to the Schofield unit will improve training opportunities with partners and allies and increase readiness. A portion of the Army’s 40,000-troop reduction would be achieved through attrition and adjustments to recruiting, but an undetermined number of soldiers — officers as well as enlisted — would be forced out of uniform, the Army said. Drake could not comment on how the reduction will affect recruitment on Kauai, but said the chances a recruit from Kauai would be stationed back in the islands were low. “Army recruiters recruit for the total Army – not specifically for Kauai,” he said. “If you join the army, your chances of coming to Hawaii from Hawaii is probably one in a 100. Based upon the current size of the force, recruiting would adjust their numbers for the whole Army.” The Army’s civilian workforce would be cut by as many as 17,000 over the four-year period. If a new round of automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, goes ahead in the budget years beginning Oct. 1, the Army says it will have to reduce even further to 420,000 soldiers by 2019. Sen. Brian Schatz, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriation Subcommittee, said the Army had been considering possibly eliminating two Brigade Combat Teams and the 25th Infantry Division Headquarters, which would have meant the departure of nearly 16,000 soldiers. But those plans have been put on hold pending future action to address sequestration. “We have been able to protect the vast majority of the soldiers here in Hawaii. Given the magnitude of the cuts that were contemplated, we are relieved that the worst case scenario did not occur,” Schatz said. David Carey, Hawaii Military Affairs Council chairman, said he’s pleased with the announcement as personnel reduction in Hawaii “could have been more significant.” “This is good news for the state, as the military is a major economic contributor, supporting more than 100,000 jobs and generating $12.2 billion for the state’s economy,” he said. “Through our collective efforts, we will be vigilant in working to maintain the current level of military personnel.” The biggest cuts would be to an infantry unit at Fort Benning, Georgia, and an airborne infantry unit at Fort Richardson in Alaska. Each would shrink from about 4,000 soldiers to about 1,050, defense officials said Wednesday. ••• Staff writer Ryan Kazmirzack and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "LabBody": "NEWARK, N.J. — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s presidential campaign is spending nearly $500,000 airing its first television ad in the early-voting state of New Hampshire. The ad, which begins airing Friday, highlights Christie’s unscripted announcement speech in his old high school gymnasium last week. The Republican governor, who has so far struggled to gain traction, calls for strong American leadership and praises his straightforward style. “I am not looking to be the most popular guy, who looks in your eyes every day and tries to figure out what you want to hear, say it, and then turn around and do something else,” Christie says in the ad, which includes footage of what appear to be everyday Americans at work and going about their lives. “I mean what I say, and I say what I mean. And that’s what America needs right now.” A spokeswoman for Christie’s campaign said the ad will be shown over the next four weeks on broadcast television stations in Boston and Manchester, New Hampshire, as well as on cable and radio stations and online. Christie is staking his campaign on doing well in New Hampshire, which holds the nation’s first primary and typically rewards more moderate Republican candidates who invest significant time on the ground. Underscoring his strategy, Christie traveled to the state immediately after his announcement and spent five days meeting potential voters and holding town hall events. Television stations are preparing for an onslaught of advertising as the 17 expected Republican presidential candidates begin to introduce themselves to voters in states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have already been airing ads, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign has invested more than $12 million in ads that start airing at the end of the year in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states.",

    "LabBody": "Earlier this week, Americans everywhere were outraged when video footage emerged of 22 year-old pop star Ariana Grande proudly proclaiming, “I hate Americans, I hate America.” As one of the most popular young stars of American today, Grande has caused many to lose faith in the younger generation. Millions of her fans have stood by her, which is a sad reminder that many kids don’t love this country like they used to. Just when we were about to lose hope, we remembered Sadie Robertson, the 18 year-old star of Duck Dynasty. While Grande was slamming our country this week, Sadie was busy teaming up with Roma Boots for their “Give Poverty The Boot” campaign. According to Conservative Tribune, Sadie is currently selling a new brand or rain boot for the company. For every boot that is purchased, the company promises to donate “a brand new pair of boots stuffed with school supplies to a child in need.” Though they are very close in age, the differences between Grande and Sadie are mind blowing. While Grande uses her fame to make videos that are even more sexually provocative and to slam our country, Sadie uses her fame to help others and spread a message of Christianity and patriotism.",

    "LabBody": "The putting and the driving and the chipping and all of that other golf stuff is nice, sure. But let’s focus on what some fans of the U.S. Women’s Open are really rabid about. The signing. Getting autographs from the likes of Michelle Wie and Inbee Park at the Open is the other major sport going on at the tournament this week. And the early champion just might have been a 14-year-old kid named Andrew Gates. Andrew, who is from Lebanon, was carrying around a tournament flag, which you could buy at the Merchandise Pavilion for 25 bucks and which is one of the most popular items to have golfers sign. By Wednesday morning, the flag was completely covered with Sharpie autographs. In fact, Andrew had already received 156 signatures. Did he know whose signature was whose? “Oh no,” he said, glancing down at the sea of inky squiggles. “No way.” At the practice rounds, spectators had plenty of opportunities to get autographs, and there was always a group patiently waiting behind the driving range or putting greens, lining a rope holding flags, hats, photos, T-shirts and even brightly colored rubber balls for the players to sign. The women graciously obliged, chatting with kids, sometimes posing for photos. The casual, friendly atmosphere of a tournament’s practice days allows fans to rub elbows and talk to some of the sport’s biggest names, which is a unique experience. “This event is probably the easiest of all major sports where you have access to players as soon as they get here,” said J.W. Besore, 30, of York, who had collected about 70 signatures on a flag and photos. “As long as you walk with them, they’ll sign. Some of the big names are very friendly.” Emily Johns, 14, of Exton, was also collecting signatures on a flag and by Wednesday, had already gotten one from last year’s champion, Michelle Wie. Emily said she memorized many of the golfers’ appearances so she could keep everyone straight in her autograph hunt. “Stacy Lewis is really nice,” she said. “So are Danielle Kang and Kim Kaufman. They asked me how I was doing and what I thought about the sport.” Gates was very organized in his approach, keeping a roster with the golfers’ names and checking them off as he obtained their signatures. He’s no newbie to the signature game, after all. At the Travelers Championship tournament two weeks ago in Connecticut, he even got a signed club from golfer Hunter Swafford. He’s gotten sigs from Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth, pretty much everyone on the PGA tour except one young golfer who is not very friendly, and in fact acts like a downright diva in some autograph seeker’s opinion, but will go unnamed. (OK, a hint: His name rhymes with glory and he’s from Northern Ireland.) Some fans, like Emily Johns, planned to frame their signed flags and hang them on a wall. Doug Swartz, 45, of York, said he was going to donate his signed flag to the annual Labor Day Auction held in Lancaster County by Hospice \u0026 Community Care, which took care of his grandpa when he was dying. Sometimes getting an autograph turns out to be thrilling for people on both sides of the pen. Finishing a practice round late Tuesday morning, Inbee Park handed her putter to her caddie and walked off the green of the ninth hole. A small pack of about a dozen autograph seekers, including 15-year-old Emma Kowzun, caught up with Park, a two-time U.S. Women's Open champ who earned $2.2 million last year. \"Good luck,\" said Emma, of Saylorsburg, Monroe County, after Park signed a big photo of Emma, who has played golf for two years, posing with Park last July at the International Crown tournament in Owens Mills, Maryland. Emma’s dad, Todd, shot the photo. Later, Stephanie Connelly, in her first U.S. Women's Open, arrived at the practice green. Connelly waited beside the rope for a spot, and Emma pounced. But for once, it might have been the golfer who was more excited than the autograph seeker. \"She told me it was her second autograph ever,\" Emma said. (Staff writer Jeff Hawkes contributed to this report.)",

    "LabBody": "State Sen. ANDY MANAR, D-Bunker Hill, expressed hope for a cooperative relationship with Republican Gov. BRUCE RAUNER back in January on the day Rauner was inaugurated. Manar praised Rauner for reaching out to individual lawmakers and said he met with the governor and some Rauner aides for more than an hour. \"I think that set a positive tone,\" Manar said at the time. \"I think that's how you get to the more difficult conversations.\" But Manar said Wednesday that the tone has since changed dramatically. \"The wheels flew off that bus a long time ago,\" he said. \"We have gone ... from what appeared to be a very open dialogue, which was promising solutions to big problems we have in the state, to a daily antagonistic environment that is fanned on a daily basis by Gov. Rauner and his administration,\" Manar told me following a news conference featuring Senate Democrats promoting a one-month budget plan for vital services. \"It's an all-or-nothing approach by the governor, and that just isn't how you govern,\" he said. It was clear to see frustration some Democrats have about services to people in need that may be interrupted by the Springfield budget battles. I asked if one side or the other — Democrats in charge of the legislature or the GOP governor — would come out the winner with the public. \"I don't view it as who wins and who loses,\" Manar said. \"I view it as, we have big problems to fix in this state, and we need solutions to those problems, understanding that no one is going to get our way on everything. ... It's illogical in a legislative environment. It's illogical in life. But we have a governor who comes into the Capitol and demands everything all the time or nothing, and that approach is not going to solve a single problem for the state. \"Put policy aside, put debate aside, put politics aside,\" Manar said. \"Anyone who demands everything all the time is not going to get anything they want.\" I said that Rauner has not included a demand for local right-to-work zones in the \"turnaround agenda\" list he wants lawmakers to pass. But Manar said, \"He has put it right back into his property tax proposal.\" The freeze proposal Rauner has pushed would exempt units of local government, including school districts, from paying prevailing wages — often union wages — on local projects. It would also allow local votes that would remove certain issues from collective bargaining, including health insurance and staffing levels. Manar's 48th Senate District includes the main Illinois State Museum, which was is targeted for possible closure by Rauner as part of the cuts the administration proposed during the current budget impasse. That impasse has included Democrats passing a budget $3 billion to $4 billion short of revenue and calling for negotiations on cuts and revenue. Even though the new fiscal year began Wednesday, a state facility closure law, providing for a public comment period, means the museum cannot close until at least Aug. 8. \"I don't think the governor was aware of it,\" Manar said of the comment period, adding that he thinks the closure, which would save less than $5 million, is not necessary. But he said it is an example of how Rauner seems to want to seek \"ransom\" from lawmakers \"until he gets his way.\" That, Manar said, has been part of the governor's \"all-or-nothing conversation.\" Manar, former Bunker Hill mayor and Macoupin County Board chairman, was chief of staff to Senate President JOHN CULLERTON, D-Chicago, before winning his own race to the Senate in 2012. He was re-elected in 2014 and is in the middle of a four-year term. He said Rauner's action Wednesday to use an amendatory veto to seek to cut cost-of-living increases for lawmakers was \"as if Gov. (ROD) BLAGOJEVICH left a playbook in the governor's office.\" \"Apparently, Gov. Rauner dusted it off,\" Manar said. \"It doesn't solve problems.\" Manar also called it \"beyond irresponsible\" to be \"injecting that political calculus on the day the fiscal year begins ... when he hasn't brought forward a budget to keep government operating.\" Manar said Rauner, instead of crafting an essential operations budget, \"apparently had meetings with his political folks, just like he did when he prepared his TV commercials ... instead of negotiating a budget.\" A Rauner-backed political action committee has run ads in June — after the scheduled adjournment of the legislature — attacking House Speaker MICHAEL MADIGAN, D-Chicago, as resisting change and just wanting to raise taxes. Madigan has called the ads extreme and not helpful. Manar said he hadn't had time to evaluate the governor's latest proposal on lawmakers' pay, but he added: \"I would remind you I don't take a pension. I made that commitment during the campaign, and I've lived up to that commitment.\" Manar said Republicans spent \"about a half million dollars on a television ad to convince voters I'm not who I am.\" Voters, he said, rejected that notion in 2012 and 2014. \"Apparently, the governor didn't know that either,\" he said. The governor has repeatedly said he's compromised by taking many issues off the table. He has also said he won't agree to more revenue to fix the unbalanced budget passed by Democrats without reforms. Rauner spokeswoman CATHERINE KELLY said the administration would urge Manar \"to respond thoughtfully to Gov. Rauner's compromise reform plan.\" Remembering Graves. NORMA GRAVES was in her late 50s when she was elected Springfield city clerk in 1987. The former owner of a real estate firm, who had also been executive secretary to the city's finance commissioner, went on to win four-year terms in 1991, 1995 and 1999. She retired in 2003. \"She was one of the people who broke the glass ceiling for the women in this area,\" said Circuit Judge LESLIE GRAVES, the youngest of four children of Norma and the late Gene Graves. Norma Graves died June 24 at age 85. She had a recurrence of a long-ago cancer. \"She was a woman ahead of her time,\" U.S. District Judge SUE MYERSCOUGH said. \"She was a role model to all of us. She and her husband were stalwarts and encouraged women to get involved in the political field.\" Norma Graves' obituary noted that the East St. Louis native took flying lessons but decided to go to Southern Illinois University Carbondale instead of seeking an aviation career. She met her husband at school. They were married during her sophomore year, and her daughter said Norma, like many people her age, quit college to help her husband get his degree. She never graduated. Leslie Graves said her mother took great pride in her career at the city. \"She was so proud of Springfield,\" Graves said. \"She was so honored to be able to be clerk. It was truly the highlight of her life, and it meant a great deal to all of us.\" Condolences to her family and many friends. — Contact Bernard Schoenburg: bernard.schoenburg@sj-r.com, 788-1540, twitter.com/bschoenburg.",

    "LabBody": "Did Ben Affleck cheat on Jennifer Garner? According to Us Weekly… yes, he did. A new report published by the magazine claims that Ben was engaged in all kinds of shady behavior before his very public divorce, and that it's those vices that caused Bennifer's untimely end. Multiple sources for the magazine say that Ben was \"partying\" \"gambling\" and engaging in \"inappropriate behavior with other women,\" and even that he \"admitted to cheating\" with an actress playing his love interest in a previous film (now's the time to start scouring IMDB for past co-stars…). Apparently, Jennifer kicked him out of the house, \"but eventually decided to forgive him.\" \"She tried to leave him few times, but he would beg her to stay,\" claims another source. It's not surprising, given the steady stream of rumors that followed the couple before they split for good. “She always fought against the urge to throw her hands up in the air and walk away,” a source adds. \"They’ve been on the brink of splitting up many times before, but it’s Jennifer’s worst nightmare for their children. Her biggest desire has always been to keep the family together.” However, not every source is saying the same thing (and it sounds like there are a ton of sources close to the couple and ready to spill the beans). According to Hollywood Life, \"the cheating claims are completely unfounded.\" And a source for People claims that the split was just as much Jen's fault as Ben's. \"Saying he's a bad father and a husband is an easy story, and everyone has wanted to clock him as a womanizer and gambler,\" an insider told the magazine. \"He couldn't deal with her expectations. When you're told you're not good enough, you start to believe it.\" Do you believe that Ben Affleck could really cheat on his wife?",

    "LabBody": "CEDAR FALLS | Stricter enforcement of rules of conduct during the \"public forum\" at Cedar Falls City Council meetings resulted in a little rancor at the end of Monday's meeting. When Mayor Jon Crews, at council members' urging, announced he was enforcing a five-minute speaker time limit, he proved he was serious by recessing the meeting and leaving frequent council speaker Jim Skaine standing at the podium -- not once, but twice, as council members and city staff left their seats. \"Censorship, Mr. Mayor. Censorship,\" protested Skaine, a retired University of Northern Iowa professor who ran for Congress decades ago. Crews responded no one was censoring Skaine, noting he'd been allowed to speak on several occasions at previous meetings and for up to 18 minutes once. Skaine, in return, took exception to the mayor interrupting him. The University Avenue project and its controversial proposed roundabout intersections were a recurring topic with a succession of speakers, as has been the case at previous council meetings. At a work session prior to the regular meeting, which was open to the public, council members urged Crews to more strictly enforce rules. \"As mayor, I am obliged by statute and City Council policy to apply and enforce the meeting rules adopted by the council,\" Crews said, reading from a prepared statement. \"A number of citizens watching our meetings and our council members believe there has been recent abuse of these rules by some speakers. In an effort to be fair to everyone desiring to speak, I will apply and enforce these rules on a more consistent basis.\" In addition to a five-minute time limit, the rules state speakers must address matters pertinent to city government. \"I will bar a speaker from further comments if I construe the comments being made to not be germane to city business or to be a personalized attack or slanderous remarks toward another party,\" Crews continued. \"If the speaker refuses to adhere to these rules and my request to terminate behavior in violation of the rules, I will promptly call for a motion to recess the meeting or adjourn the meeting.\" Skaine was in the middle of a speech on roundabouts, censorship and gun violence when Crews recessed the meeting for the first time, prompting protests from Skaine. After Crews re-convened the meeting, he came close to ruling University Avenue roundabout opponent Larry Wyckoff out of order when he began discussing a Cedar Falls School District bond referendum that failed last week. Wyckoff avoided that when he came to his point, suggesting if the school district \"wasted\" taxpayer money by holding a second bond vote, the city could at least hold a referendum on University Avenue. Resident Dave Halterman and Crews had a less-than-amicable exchange on the University project when Community Development Director Ron Gaines, responding to a previous information request, reported there are less expensive alternatives to renovating University Avenue, though they do not fit council goals. Halterman took exception to Crews' subsequent comment that a gravel road or cowpath also would be less expensive. Though Crews indicated he did not intend his remarks as facetious, Halterman said that was \"disingenuous.\" Developer Craig Fairbanks said while he respected everyone's opinions, he was \"tired\" of the roundabout debate and the city should move on. The University proposal is \"a good plan,\" he said. When Skaine rose again to question Crews as to how many times he had interrupted Skaine at previous meetings, Crews called for adjournment. While several people at the meeting supported Skaine, one told him later that had he been addressing a different governmental body he could have faced physical removal from the chambers. Council members suggested personal attacks could be minimized by having speakers address Crews instead of individual council members or staff. Crews also said council members should not debate with public forum speakers. However, council members wanted the opportunity to question staff as to the accuracy of statements speakers make. Correction (July 8, 2015): The second sentence of the last paragraph was corrected to indicate Crews said council members should \"not\" debate with forum speakers.",

Robert Bentley rolled out his plans today for a special session in which he will try again to persuade lawmakers to opt for tax increases over slashes to government services. Bentley is bringing lawmakers into special session starting Monday to craft a general fund budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The governor said while Alabama residents have been traditionally opposed to taxes, he believes they object more to the cuts that will happen without new revenue.",

    "LabBody": "An update on what brand strategists think of the Maggi tangle, two months on. It has been two months, and the spotlight on Nestle’s Maggi, whose noodles were allegedly found to have excessive levels of lead and MSG, has been unrelenting. The latest piece of news to make headlines is that Nestle is forking out Rs 20 crore to get its stocks destroyed, which will no doubt add to the many blows, moral and monetary, it has suffered since May 2015. It was banned in several States and then the Food Safety \u0026 Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) ordered it off the shelves. The controversy has singed other instant noodles brands too, with brands such as ITC’s Yippee, Top Ramen and Wai Wai coming under the scanner and some of them being recalled. Branding experts had told cat.a.lyst that brand Maggi would not suffer long-term losses to its reputation despite the trouble it was then beginning to face. (A Question of Trust, cat.a.lyst dated May 29). They had said that it was a very strong brand for people to stop believing in it or even believe that its manufacturer was guilty of negligence. Two months down the line, though, with all the consequences and the sales of the entire category of instant noodles down a reported 90 per cent, do they still think their views hold good? Hamsini Shivkumar, co-founder, Leapfrog Strategy Consulting, says restoring normalcy is a long haul. “First, the company has to work with the FSSAI and other States' authorities to re-negotiate the ban. Then, it will have to re-introduce stocks with a strong re-assurance campaign. And then wait for consumer response to come back. All of this will take at least two years, perhaps even three.” In the long run, the growth curve of instant noodles in India could plateau, she says. “In terms of other packaged foods companies, there will certainly be concern in the board rooms that they should not be unfairly victimised through political theatre around packaged foods,” she adds. One of the criticisms against Nestle at that stage was that it had not addressed the issue and contained the damage swiftly enough. “It still needs to do more to win over customers’ trust,” says Alpana Parida, president of brand strategy and design firm DY Works. Given that it is a brand that is consumed across a wide range of socio-economic groups, its announcement that it will be getting its samples tested independently in international labs has not gotten much visibility, she adds. “The issue has definitely shifted the focus to the fact that people are more aware of food safety issues, and also shows the Government in a better light. It is definitely a dent in Maggi’s image, but it will die down. These brands (including others being investigated) are too strong, and they are big business earners,” says Raghu Viswanath, founder of brand advisory firm Vertebrand. Parida points to reports that Nestle will launch other snacks under the Maggi brand to make up for the losses from the recall of its noodles. In the light of all that has happened, isn’t it a bold move? And would the Government be receptive to it? “Well, Nestle’s back is to the wall. It must surely have done its research. Maggi’s success is due to its masala, not its noodles, and it has to bring it back, even if it has to apply it to other products,” she adds. Maggi is still loved and if it makes its new products safer, healthier and more natural, it will succeed. As for the Government, it needs to be seen as fair and vested in fostering a fair business climate. So if Nestle unveils a new product with a new formulation, it could be passed, I don’t see the Government being bitter,” she adds. Watch this space.",

    "LabBody": "AS time goes by I am more convinced it was a big mistake to separate Australia’s national capital from the rest of the country. The move has insulated federal politicians and bureaucrats in Canberra from the real Australia. An example is the rhetoric and even blatant propaganda being used by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority in an attempt to persuade the public that not only is its ill-conceived basin plan a good idea but it is working well. Most people agree on the need for a long-term plan for the basin but we have ended up with one that is undermining the very ­social fabric that holds regional communities together. Under the leadership of one of Australia’s most influential former politicians, Craig Knowles, the authority’s independence from political persuasion has all but disappeared and a new culture has become ­embedded. RELATED COVERAGE. MPs lend an ear to MDBA critics. Communities have lost confidence in the organisation and no longer trust its engagement processes. In response to business and community concerns about the devastating social and economic effects of the basin plan, Murray interests held a strategy meeting in Deniliquin on May 26 that resulted in a motion of no confidence being moved against the MDBA. Each of the key stakeholder groups expressed huge frustration and disappointment that even though they attended meetings, provided ­informed delegations for politicians and bureaucrats, as well as spending hundreds of hours writing submissions and letters, their messages ­appeared to fall on deaf ears. A recent assessment of the effects of implementation of the basin plan on the Wakool Shire clearly indicates the devastating impact it is having on the region’s economy and on its social fabric. While there has always been ambiguity and debate surrounding a balanced triple bottom line, the evidence is stark — the environment has primacy over social and economic considerations. This is confirmed by the huge amount of taxpayer dollars being spent reporting the benefits of the basin plan to the environment, with the negatives and benefit cost ratios virtually ignored. At last, under the leadership of Senator John Madigan, our communities are pleased to see a number of politicians realising the huge negative consequences of a bad plan. ●John Lolicato is Murray Valley Private Diverters and Wakool River Association chairman.",

    "LabBody": "BARRINGTON — The Suncook Valley 12-year-old Cal Ripken All-Star baseball team is no stranger to close games.With the bases loaded and potential winning run at the plate in the bottom of the sixth inning, Suncook Valley pitcher Ryker Burke struck out the final batter to seal a 4-1 win over Barrington in the winners' bracket final of the state tournament on Friday at the Barrington Youth Association fields. \"I was nervous,\" Burke said. \"It felt great. I was really happy.\"Host Barrington will play in an elimination game this morning (10 a.m.) against Exeter. The winner of that game will have to beat Suncook Valley twice on Sunday in the final round. Suncook Valley had to win several close games to win its district tournament, then survived a slugfest vs. Newmarket in the winners' bracket semifinal on Wednesday. Suncook Valley held on to win 9-8 when Newmarket had the potential tying run at third base. \"No question about it, they thrive under pressure,\" Suncook Valley coach Chip Wagner said. \"They never give up. We had some solid pitching. We don't hit the long ball, but we hit the ball.\"Burke pitched very well on Friday, scattering four hits and three walks in a complete-game effort. He struck out three. It also helped that his defense played clean behind him with minimal errors. Third baseman Gavin Bedell was a vacuum cleaner at the hot corner with four putouts.Suncook Valley got all the runs it needed in the second inning when Jeff Wagner, Burke and Chris Daniels hit back-to-back-to-back doubles.\"It was the first pitch, and it felt good when I hit the ball,\" Daniels said. \"It felt pretty good to give my team the lead.\"The parade of doubles gave Suncook Valley a 2-1 lead. \"We were putting the bat on the ball,\" Jeff Wagner said. \"Doubles are great — it moves the runner up.\"Suncook Valley maintained that lead until the sixth when it added two more insurance runs. Nate Cassidy and Jeff Wagner walked to lead off the frame, and both scored when Burke bunted and reached on an error. Barrington, which got its first run on a solo home run by Messenger in the bottom of the first inning, did not go quietly in the bottom of the sixth. Messenger singled, Bode Harmon walked and Jacob Pelletier reached on an error to load the bases with two outs. But Burke remained calm and got the final batter, who represented the winning run, to strike out swinging. \"We're coming back (today), and we're here to play,\" Barrington coach Jason Decota said. \"We have a lot of heart. We just didn't make it through the last inning.\"nnnExeter was a 10-2 winner over Newmarket in the elimination-bracket semifinal, played simultaneously. Exeter got three hits apiece from Dan Kolifrath and Mike Rollick. Pitcher Dan Sarmiento struck out nine. For Newmarket, Keenan Mills had a single and a double and Ryan Zubricki had a hit.",

    "LabBody": "The U.S. had more than 3.9 million births in 2013, according to the most recent birth data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, just 4,364 were triplets, 260 of which were in Washington, according to the CDC data. Kadie and David Warner knew they had a narrow window of time to have a baby. Kadie had recently received a high-dose of radioactive iodine to fight thyroid cancer. She had to wait a year to see if another dose would be necessary. Her doctors told her one dose lowers the odds of conceiving; two doses would make getting pregnant even tougher. So Kadie’s doctor gave the Vancouver couple the go-ahead to try for a baby in the interim. One month later, Kadie learned she was pregnant. The following month, Kadie and David learned they were having not one baby, but three. The couple who were told they may have a hard time conceiving suddenly were the parents-to-be of spontaneous triplets. “It was two weeks of head-spinning shock,” Kadie said. “We really couldn’t even believe it for a while.” Kadie was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in April 2013. She had two surgeries before having her first dose of radioactive iodine. The Warners found out they were pregnant in January and learned they were having triplets in February. In April, they found out all three babies were girls. Kadie continued working as a fourth-grade teacher at Orchards Elementary School until May 20, when, at 22-weeks pregnant, she was put on bed rest. On June 9, Kadie began having contractions. “Everyone was really worried because those are really early babies,” Kadie said. She was less than 26 weeks pregnant. Kadie was admitted to PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center and remained there on bed rest for two more weeks. The babies were delivered via Caesarean section on June 24 — Kadie’s 29th birthday — when she was just 27 weeks pregnant. A full-term pregnancy is 39 to 40 weeks, but most triplet pregnancies last 32 weeks, according to the March of Dimes. “That was the best birthday present,” Kadie said. First came Piper Jo at 2 pounds, 7 ounces. Then Zelda Rose, who also weighed 2 pounds, 7 ounces. Last was Laurel Rene, who weighed 2 pounds, 9 ounces. They don’t know yet if the girls are identical. Laurel had to be intubated at birth; the other two only needed the CPAP machine, which is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep the airways open. “They’re actually doing remarkably well for 27-weekers,” Kadie said. The girls remain at PeaceHealth Southwest in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. All three girls remain on the CPAP, but the machine is only using room air, not oxygen. All three were off of their IVs within a couple of days, and they’re all getting breast milk through feeding tubes, Kadie said. Piper and Zelda are back up to their birth weights. Laurel is about a half ounce shy of hers. “There’s nothing substantial we’re watching or concerned about,” Kadie said. “They just need to grow.” Premature babies typically stay in the NICU until they’ve reached what would be 34 to 36 weeks gestation, but it’s possible the girls could need to stay longer, Kadie said. Until they go home, Kadie spends her days rotating between the three NICU rooms. She holds one baby, skin-to-skin, for about 90 minutes. Once she’s done, she eats and pumps breast milk. Then, she repeats the routine for the other two girls. David returned to his job as a preschool teacher a couple of days after the girls were born. He’ll continue working until it’s time for the babies to go home, when he will take more time off. Kadie won’t likely return to teaching until at least January. She doesn’t receive paid maternity leave, so the couple started a GoFundMe page, www.gofundme.com/mnjxio, to raise money to help pay some of their medical bills and living expenses. The page has collected more than $3,000 so far. Because of the girls’ low birth weights and their long stays in the NICU, the Warners will receive some Social Security assistance. A man at their church also donated his Jeep Cherokee to the couple since they had a pair of two-door cars, neither of which could accommodate three car seats. “It’s been pretty incredible,” Kadie said. “His request for payment was just to hold them.” “God is just providing,” she added. “So I’m not worried, but it’s certainly trying to not be working.” She’s also still fighting thyroid cancer. Next month, Kadie has a follow-up appointment with her endocrinologist to determine whether she needs another dose of radioactive iodine. If so, she’ll have to be away from the babies for two weeks — something she’s trying to avoid. Given the previous radioactive iodine dose, Kadie and David knew they likely only had one shot to have a baby. They never expected triplets — they have no family history of multiple births — and were especially surprised to have three girls, since the Warner family hasn’t had girls in two generations. “We’re just happy to have them,” Kadie said. “Everybody asks us how we’re going to do it, and we don’t know. It’s just one day at a time.” Marissa Harshman: 360-735-4546; marissa.harshman@columbian.com; twitter.com/MarissaHarshman.",

This time it's Dalvin Cook, a 19-year-old sophomore running back, reports the Tallahassee Democrat. Police say he punched the woman multiple times outside a bar in Tallahassee on June 23 and charged him with misdemeanor battery. He has been suspended from the team. The following night, FSU quarterback De'Andre Johnson was seen on surveillance video punching a different woman at a different bar. He's been kicked off the team. The 21-year-old woman in the Cook case tells ESPN that a man, not Cook, approached her outside the bar and asked for her phone number. She refused, and she says the man returned with Cook, who punched her when a heated argument erupted. \"They kept telling me they were football players,\" the woman says. \"They kept telling me to Google them. They told me they were football players and they could buy me in two years.\"",

    "LabBody": "Officials with the Odessa Animal Shelter are continuing their push to adopt or foster out as many animals as they can before renovations begin next week. Jacqueline Adimare, shelter manager, said since renovations will begin Monday that includes sealing the floors in the adoption building to make cleaning and disinfecting easier. Because the adoption building cannot be done in phases, Adimare said the entire area would have to be closed for the construction. “We would not be able to shut down just half of that building because of the fumes and the noise,” she said. Funds for the renovations came from fundraising efforts and a Valentine’s Day benefit held this year. Though she did not have an exact number of animals that had been adopted out, Adimare said the response to the push has been positive, adding the parking lot has been “swamped” since the announcement was made last week. Animals not adopted out by the beginning of the week will be euthanized. In a news release from the City of Odessa early this week, adoption fees have been waived for those looking to adopt an animal from the shelter. Adimare also said some animals will be placed with foster groups during the week and anyone who wants to help foster an animal for a week can do so by speaking to people at the shelter. “We’re doing everything we possibly can to get these animals out of here,” she said. The shelter is open today from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. and on Saturday from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Adimare also said an offsite adoption is scheduled for today from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. at Gatti's Pizza, 2750 N. Grandview Ave. More offsite adoptions are scheduled from 3 p.m. until 4 p.m. Saturday at Cinergy Midland, 1917 Liberty Drive, Midland; and one from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. at John’s Corner, 3827 N.

    "DiffbotBody": "With the majority of head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad back in pre-season training, preparations for Tottenham Hotspur's 2014-15 campaign are well underway. For supporters, glimpses of the team's sessions on social media are better than nothing after a month away. But the opportunity to actually see their team in action—players new and old working together for the first time—that is when things begin to feel real again. Over the following pages Bleacher Report looks at Tottenham's announced opponents for this summer's friendlies. We begin with the League One outfit hosting a Spurs XI side (likely consisting of development squad talent and any auxiliary players Pochettino needs to run the rule over), right up to the big-name opposition the first team will face just days prior to the Premier League season opener. Pre-season only tells us so much, but they are nonetheless fascinating steps toward the proper action beginning. Begin Slideshow » Tottenham's first opponents of the summer, Peterborough United, got their pre-season off to a winning start this past week with a 3-2 win over Dulwich Hamlet. On the scoresheet was striker Joe Gormley, signed in June after netting 40 goals for Northern Irish side Cliftonville last season. The 26-year-old's scoring exploits saw him mentioned in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by UEFA.com's Darren Fullerton in the spring. Now Peterborough manager Dave Robertson is hoping Gormley can help fire his team out of League One. \"I'm over the moon, he's a fantastic signing for us,\" Robertson told The Posh TV. \"We know that Joe is going to bring goals to the team next season.\" Ninth in England's third tier last season, Posh have also added former West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison to a squad that includes former Spurs goalkeeper Ben Alnwick. The new blood, coupled with last season's experience, has suitably raised expectations. \"Anything but promotion is failure in my eyes,\" defender Michael Smith admitted to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, per BBC Sport. With a game against West Ham already under their belts by then, Peterborough should be in shape to provide Spurs a decent examination of their burgeoning fitness levels. After 2014's three-match North American tour, Tottenham make a briefer visit to the States this year as they participate in the MLS All-Star Game. The eighth English club to be invited to take on the league's best since the old East vs. West All-Star format was abandoned, Spurs follow Bayern Munich who were defeated 2-1 in last year's match. Preferring to keep most of his team's preparations closer to home, the fixture is Pochettino's one pre-season concession to the now-routine activity of Premier League clubs heading overseas to further their global brand. Despite being a primarily commercial exercise, Spurs should find an exacting on-pitch challenge in the form of an MLS select group attempting to again demonstrate their ability against one of European football's famous old names. The still-to-be-confirmed team could well feature former Spurs striker Robbie Keane, in his fifth year with the division's reigning champions Los Angeles Galaxy. For several of Pochettino's team, it will be their first opportunity to get some important minutes in their legs ahead of the Premier League season. Those not making the trip to Colorado will be heading to Hertfordshire as Spurs open August away at . A frequent pre-season opponent over the years, Stevenage's Lamex Stadium also hosts the club's under-21 fixtures that don't take place at the training ground or White Hart Lane. This latest meeting carries extra intrigue in that it is one of the first games for recently installed Stevenage boss and Spurs Hall of Fame inductee Teddy Sheringham. \"The aim is to do better than last season,\" said Sheringham to his new club's official website following his appointment, while understanding that will be difficult given they reached the League Two play-off semi-final. The existing Spurs links at the club did not escape him either. \"I know a few of the boys, the likes of Chris Day were at Tottenham, I think Charlie Lee might have kicked me once or twice when he was coming through the ranks. I know Ronnie Henry too.\" Defender Mark Hughes, midfielder Steven Schumacher and centre-forward Brett Williams have all been drafted in to join those already there. Sheringham told the club's website he intends \"to bring in two or three more players at least\" but also stated \"I like what I have got now, the base of what we have looks really good.\" The Boro first team plays Wealdstone in its first friendly this weekend before visiting St Neots Town next week. Prior to taking on Tottenham in the final warm-up before the season begins, Sheringham's squad will take on another two of his old clubs, Nottingham Forest and Millwall. Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, , have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him. Indeed, the Mirror's Liam Corless reports Real fans were chanting not-so-secret target David De Gea's name during the unveiling of the aforementioned signing from Porto. Regardless of their result against Real Madrid, Tottenham will have one more match in Munich the following day. They will face either or hosts Bayern in either the third/fourth play-off or final. Last season's 10th-place finish in Serie A has prompted change on and off the pitch at Milan. Pippo Inzaghi has been replaced with Sampdoria boss Sinisa Mihajlovic in the San Siro hot seat (almost as toasty as that found at the Bernabeu). Luiz Adriano and Carlos Bacca formerly of Shakhtar Donetsk and Sevilla, respectively, have been brought in to bolster the team's flagging attack. From within Italian borders they have drafted in Andrea Bertolacci and Luca Antonelli to try and improve things in midfield and defence. The Rossoneri would kill for the kind of season Bayern Munich had. Despite a dominant run to the Bundesliga title, the failure to win the Champions League has upped the pressure on Pep Guardiola. Bayern have been brilliant more often than not on his watch. Yet Guardiola's inability thus far to replicate the success enjoyed by the team in Jupp Heynckes' final season two years ago could count against him soon enough, no matter the difficulty of matching 2012-13's extraordinary treble. Should Spurs cross paths with Bayern in August, and depending on the circumstances, they could be witness to a fascinating atmosphere at the Allianz Arena. Iffy performances from the German side in their own tournament do not necessarily mean anything at such an early stage. But Guardiola and his team would prefer to launch their latest pursuit for glory and history in the most positive fashion possible.",
    "LabBody": "Tottenham not wrapping up their pre-season programme with a fixture at White Hart Lane has been a rarity in recent times. But those supporters hoping to get a pre-opening day idea of how the club's new signings are faring alongside their new team-mates will likely have to be content with their involvement in the Audi Cup. Their semi-final opponents out in Germany, Real Madrid, have changed manager more times than Spurs in the last decade. \"Here in Real Madrid the demands are great and nothing is ever enough,\" president Florentino Perez bluntly stated at the appointment of the latest man to try and fulfil the lofty expectations of the Bernabeu, former B team boss Rafa Benitez. Despite a mixed couple of years at Napoli, the well-travelled coach will be as confident as anyone he can do so. \"I hope things go well, that we are able to win titles and also that the team play well,\" Benitez said upon his arrival, also via the club's official website. \"I would like to thank the club for the faith they have shown in my work.\" He inherits a team that reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and finished second to the eventual European champions Barcelona in La Liga. A rough year by their standards, they certainly remain an opponent Pochettino will relish pitting his young team against. The Spanish giants still boast an enviable array of talent including James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and former Spurs men Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. Brazilian right-back Danilo is their standout recruit thus far this summer, and you would suspect others will soon join him.

    "LabBody": "VIRGIN Australia has joined Jetstar in announcing it is able to resume flights to and from Bali thanks to improved conditions around Denpasar airport. EARLIER on Saturday Indonesian officials declared Bali's Denpasar Airport safe to reopen as the cloud of ash from the eruption of Mount Raung drifted away. Virgin sent an observation flight to Denpasar so its pilots could have visual confirmation of the conditions before recommencing operations. With the safety thumbs-up given, Virgin said scheduled flights out of Denpasar would go ahead on Saturday evening and it plans to continue operations in and out of Bali tomorrow. Earlier on Saturday, a Jetstar spokesman said the airline had determined it was safe to fly all scheduled services to Bali that evening, after careful assessment of the latest Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) information. \"We're pleased that flying conditions allow us to start bringing people back to Australia on return services from tomorrow morning,\" the spokesman said. Both Jetstar and Virgin said additional services from Bali to Australia were being organised for Sunday. However Virgin cautioned travellers against thinking the volcanic ash cloud disruptions were completely over. \"Please note that Mt Raung continues to erupt at this time and it is likely that operations could be disrupted again over the next few days if there are changes to wind conditions,\" they said in a statement, adding conditions would be monitored closely. Mt Raung erupted on July 2, emitting plumes of ash which can choke jet engines. The volcano is about 150 kilometres west of Denpasar airport, the main airport for those heading to Bali. Denpasar airport was closed on Friday because of the ash, along with nearby regional terminals including Lombok. The ash grounded planes from Virgin, Jetstar, Garuda and AirAsia on Friday.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "It's about to get real hot, real quickly. And in case anyone doubted it, fate just twisted again. The Royals lost star outfielder Alex Gordon for eight weeks with a groin strain, countering the loss of Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera for six weeks with a calf strain. The truth is, the straining has just begun. Tigers president and general manager Dave Dombrowski is about to face the most important stretch of his 13-year tenure, and Brad Ausmus is about to get his managerial chops severely tested. The news from Kansas City is another reason Detroit can't give in to frustration and bail at the trade deadline, and I highly doubt it will. Barring a sudden collapse, the Tigers should be determined buyers before July 31. They need at least one starting pitcher and one reliever, and it won't be easy to land them with a depleted farm system. Dombrowski has put Ausmus in a tough position, saddling an inexperienced manager with a dreadful bullpen. What's the biggest complaint about Ausmus? That he leaves starters in too long, which may have led to that breakdown last week when David Price thought he was out after six innings, and Ausmus thought he was still in. When trying to coax innings out of struggling starters to avoid a fateful bullpen call, a manager can appear indecisive and inconsistent. And it's true, Ausmus has not ruled with a firm enough hand. The Tigers play too casually at times, evidenced by an unacceptable spate of missed signs and pickoffs. Yet they're still in contention, 2½ games out of a wild card as they began a crucial four-game road series against the Twins on Thursday night, and 7½ games behind the Royals. They're treading slightly above water primarily because two key pieces are proving to be much more than flashes in the pan. (By the way, why can't Dombrowski ever find flashes in the 'pen?) J.D. Martinez and Jose Iglesias are All-Stars, rescuing a lineup that has missed Cabrera and Victor Martinez. The offense has heated up, which brings us back to where all the troubles began, on the mound. Buying only viable option The Tigers won't win anything the way they're pitching, with Price the only reliable starter. If Dombrowski doesn't acquire help, he's effectively pulling the plug without actually dealing anyone away. But Dombrowski's overriding strength is his boldness in times of need. He almost always hunts down pitching, and there are a lot of names available, big and small, from Cole Hamels to Johnny Cueto to Scott Kazmir to Jonathan Papelbon to Jeff Samardzija. The problem is, Dombrowski doesn't have a lot of trade chips after liberally (and rightly) dealing prospects. And because so many teams are bunched close to the wild-card spots, few may be willing to surrender. It should be mentioned, for the 579th time, the World Series participants last year, the Giants and Royals, were wild cards. The fanciful hope is that Justin Verlander finds his command and Shane Greene returns from the minors with confidence intact and Anibal Sanchez and Alfredo Simon smooth out their rough patches. But adding someone is really the only viable option, because selling off pieces makes little sense. Price is a pending free agent, and the return on half-season rentals is lower. Same with Yoenis Cespedes, Simon or Joakim Soria. With Price, the compensatory draft pick if he leaves in free agency might be as valuable as a prospect or two. The notion the Tigers can restock and contend quickly again is a bit far-fetched. In many ways, they've become like Mike Ilitch's other team, the Red Wings, who have reached the playoffs 24 straight years. The Tigers are trying to do it a fifth straight year, still seeking a World Series championship to validate the expense. It's getting harder to sustain, as their pitching riches dwindle. In past seasons, the Tigers bolstered their roster not merely to make the playoffs, but to improve their chances of winning it all. That was the idea behind acquiring Doug Fister, Sanchez, Price and Soria. They were worthy additions, much better than when Dombrowski tries to subtract. Tigers prospects still bright. You really want to retool and collect prospects? You mean like the time Dombrowski traded Fister for Robbie Ray, Ian Krol and Steve Lombardozzi? Ray has contributed in Arizona — and Detroit got Greene for him, but ultimately, surrendered a major asset for little. That's the unpredictable nature of prospects. And that's why the next three weeks could define Dombrowski's tenure, and could determine Ausmus' future. Ausmus hasn't proved to be some strategic whiz, and his players have too many mental lapses. But to be fair, it's hard to fully judge a manager when his bullpen is so flawed. Dombrowski has crafted a highly successful run, with five playoff appearances and two AL pennants. But with all the resources at his disposal, he'll be measured by championship or no championship. Fans might wail and rail about the inconsistencies, but emotion can't drive the next moves. Some of the numbers are ugly but high-end talent remains. The national perspective always seems to be brighter for the Tigers, and Bovada in Las Vegas gives them the fourth-best odds to win the AL, behind the Royals, Astros and Yankees. There's nothing overly formidable about that group, especially with Gordon out. Of course, some figured the Tigers would be doomed without Cabrera, and they've played better the past week. More than halfway through the season, there's still no clarity on what the Tigers are. That should be unsettling for Dombrowski and Ausmus, but it shouldn't be unsolvable. This is a sport where contenders get reshuffled every week, and as long as you're in it, you're obligated to stay in it. bob.wojnowski@detroitnews.com. twitter.com/bobwojnowski.",

    "DiffbotBody": "A different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. How exactly does one follow up , the surprise-hit, male-stripper melodrama that catered to a heated audience (mainly female, slightly male) but served them a cinematic buffet concocted by skilled storyteller Steven Soderbergh? Easy. You take the show on the road. To that extent, Magic Mike XXL is the most accurate depiction of male entertainers road-tripping from Tampa to Myrtle Beach for an annual convention that Hollywood has ever produced. If you only see one movie this summer about male strippers bonding over unfulfilled dreams while they titillate female clientele, make sure it’s this one. Why? Because it’s great. Magic Mike XXL often operates as the movie Entourage desperately wanted to be – or worse, actually thinks that it is. It’s 100% bro-powered, telling the low-stakes story of impossibly handsome dudes living their irregular lives, and inviting us along for the intimate ride. But the camaraderie and mutual respect – the Zen-like “chi” that’s preached and practiced by the men of Mike -- is as organic as unforced as Entourage was artificial. As a result, Magic Mike is believable, embraceable, and worthy of celebration. Where Richard Donner’s Superman once inspired us to believe that a man can fly, Magic Mike XXL convinces us beyond a shadow of a doubt that a dancer can leave the stage behind and open an ice cream truck that has a DJ booth attached -- entertaining the masses and satisfying their sweet tooth at the same time. Picking up shortly after Magic Mike concluded, the sequel finds Mike (Channing Tatum) struggling to get his carpentry business off the ground when a phone call summons him back to Florida’s Gulf Coast. Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), the freewheeling choreographer and club owner, has jumped ship, leaving beautiful but dense dancers “Big Dick” Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan, (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer) and Tito (Adam Rodriguez) rudderless. Sensing that their stripper endeavors are drawing to a close, the guys agree to venture to South Carolina for one last blowout bash at an annual dancers’ convention. Along the way, Mike convinces them to ditch the routines that Dallas burned into their individual memories (“You are not a fireman, Richie”) and embrace new routines that come from the heart. And the crotch. But mainly from the heart. Magic Mike XXL pulls off a legitimate magic trick, recognizing the expectations of its suddenly sizable fanbase and somehow exceeding them. Magic Mike XXL isn’t surprising anyone this time out. The original film cost roughly $7 million, but went on to gross a massive $167 million, fuelled by female curiosity, the magnetism of Tatum (and his co-stars), and legitimately positive word of mouth that proclaimed Soderbergh crafted a moving soap-opera in a seedy, sweat-soaked Tampa strip club – the unlikeliest of cinematic communities. Audiences came to the theater with crumpled up singles, but left Magic Mike with soggy tissues, emotionally buying in to the ongoing struggles of these three-dimensional dancers. A sequel was inevitable, and with it comes change. Soderbergh opted to stay in his self-imposed “retirement,” handing the directing duties over to longtime collaborator Gregory Jacobs (though Soderbergh did contribute to XXL as a cinematographer and editor, explaining why this follow-up has the same sweaty, late-night shimmer of the first film). And now that he has an Oscar on his shelf, McConaughey chose to hang up Dallas’ leather chaps and opt out of the fun. No bother. His mystical aura is usurped by a larger-than-life Jada Pinkett Smith, who slinks across the screen and deliberately swipes every scene as Rome, an uber-confident and confidence-boosting Savannah strip club owner who welcomes Mike back into her world of empowerment. Like Dallas, Rome resembles a character we only think exists on screen in stories like Mike XXL, and I wondered numerous times during her unique scenes if this person, and her establishment, actually exist. Moving forward, however, I don’t need more Rome. Quite the contrary. I’d be thrilled if each Magic Mike sequel found a new character actor willing to fill the “role” of outsized Mike mentor, the way McConaughey and Pinkett Smith already have. Wait, subsequent Magic Mike movies? You better believe it. Magic Mike XXL is a different movie than its predecessor. It’s less serious, and far more entertaining… by design. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and surprisingly unpredictable. And yes, the dance sequences are creatively provocative, just as you were hoping. XXL sheds the heaviest baggage of Soderbergh’s initial foray, keeping just enough drama to ensure tension, then filling in the gaps with unfiltered bro-heavy chemistry. It’s a winning formula, and one that proves that Mike’s world is one worth revisiting, just to spend time with these friends. We spend a lot of time talking about developing Cinematic Universes for characters who don tights and capes. What about the guys who slip out of their super suits to entertain? Don’t they deserve their own multi-film series? If and when Magic Mike XXL matches the box-office bar set by the original, it’s time we start having that conversation.",

    "LabBody": "In the ineffectual new fantasy-thriller “Self/less” the fantastical plot device — a body-switching process costing millions and not covered by any known health plan — is called “shedding.” You buy yourself a new, longer life in a younger person’s body, and your troubles are over. Or ARE THEY? Ben Kingsley, sounding like a compendium of every attempt at a New York accent ever heard in the movies, plays Damian Hale, a Trump-like Manhattan developer (i.e., he’s a selfish bastard) who beats a terminal cancer prognosis by hooking up with a mysterious biogenic company run by purring, movie-stealing Matthew Goode. Early on in “Self/less” Hale gets zwooped into the body of a new human vessel, portrayed by top-billed Ryan Reynolds. The intrigue in “Self/less,” only occasionally intriguing, comes with the complications. When Kingsley’s character turns into Reynolds, his memories are no longer strictly his own. In his addled mind’s eye the new Hale experiences flashes of another life, a different past. It’s up to this new, strapping version of Hale to figure out what shedding entails, and learn the identity of the woman (Natalie Martinez) he can’t get out of his head. Most of “Self/less” takes place in New Orleans, which has two advantages to a modestly budgeted project such as this one. One: It’s a place that reeks of death and rebirth, photogenically. And two: Louisiana’s one of the cheapest places you can make a movie. The producers of “Self/less” scored a solid success with the inventive, cleverly elaborated “Looper.” It’s possible director Tarsem Singh’s film will receive a similarly warm welcome. But I doubt it. Singh’s previous work includes “The Cell” (Jennifer Lopez in a series of swanky nightmare scenarios) and “The Fall,” a strange, grandiose, somewhat icky adventure story set in the silent film era. “Self/less” is much smaller, and not nearly strange or transporting enough. Small can be good in speculative fiction; look at “Ex Machina,” for example. This script by Alex Pastor and David Pastor reveals its secrets predictably, and Singh struggles to make his locations come alive on screen. Stupid as it sounds, a few more extras wouldn’t have hurt. There are times, as when Reynolds drives down a highway at night pursued by members of the company who wants him dead, when the landscape is as desolate as “Zombieland.” Reynolds can be charming and effective as a leading man in both comedy and drama, but his somewhat glazed expression and tweezed good looks can work against him. The cast, including ever-reliable Victor Garber as Hale’s longtime friend and colleague, does what it can. “Self/less” hews closely enough to the premise of the 1966 John Frankenheimer thriller “Seconds” to qualify as an unofficial remake. Then again, anyone who remembers that one is not in the target audience for this one.",

    "LabBody": "(StatePoint) Whether you’re preparing to sell, or just looking to increase your home’s value, it’s important to think about strategic upgrades -- and not just how; but where to remodel. Here are a few ideas to help you prioritize home remodeling endeavors. Create Curb Appeal. Imagine walking up your driveway as a potential buyer. Does the exterior leave a lasting impression? Begin the process of preparing your home for sale at the front door by creating an inviting entryway that will entice potential buyers even before they step foot inside. Adding a pop of color to your front door will make a statement, and changing out the hardware fixtures will update the look instantly. Cleaning up your lawn, power washing siding, and planting trees, bushes and flowers are simple ways to invest in your home’s curb appeal. Lining the walkway with solar-powered lights is also a nice touch. Update the Bath. Bathrooms and kitchens are the most popular renovation projects, with the greatest number of consumers concentrating their attention on the bath, according to a recent Houzz and Home survey of homeowners. When remodeling, focus on details that can quickly update the space, such as installing quality fixtures. As you begin the selection process for new bath fixtures, consider those with a timeless style that will be appreciated by you and a wide variety of home buyers. For versatility, check out the Wynford collection from Moen, which offers a wide range of faucet options and finish choices. Increasing storage, along with a few other fixes, can add thousands of dollars to your home’s value, according to a Bankrate.com report. Key updates improve both the look and functionality of the bathroom. Try adding storage or installing a new shower curtain rod. A curved shower rod, such as those from Moen, can add up to an additional seven inches of space in the shower. A Little Clean Up. More than two out of five real estate professionals rank dirt, smells and clutter high on their list of costliest home-selling mistakes, according to a recent survey by Consumer Reports. Smells could indicate a serious problem in the home, such as mold or mildew. Use a dehumidifier to dry out damp areas. Also, have your carpets and drapery professionally cleaned on a regular basis, especially if you have pets. If your home could use a deep clean, it might be worth investing in a professional service. Concentrating on essential repairs and easy updates can instantly change the perception of your home and help you make the most from your sale.",

    "LabBody": "July 15 marks the 23rd ESPY Awards, the annual ceremony devoted to honoring standout professional and collegiate athletes and teams of the past year. It’s the sports equivalent to the Oscars or Grammys, so why not put a high school spin on the concept? Over the past school year, District 9-5A has showcased no shortage of notable individual and team athletic achievements, so it’s only appropriate to put the last season of local varsity sports into an award-winning perspective. In recent weeks, the area’s top athletes, teams and games have been recognized among nine different awards. With that said, Star Local Media presents the third edition of The Varsitys. Biggest Story. Football playoff race. The playoff race on the gridiron in District 9-5A won’t soon be forgotten … and likely won’t be replicated. With two weeks remaining in the regular season, as many as seven teams were still in the hunt for one of four playoff berths, and the possibility of a seven-way tie for first at 5-3 existed. One week later, that number had been whittled down to six — with each team still possessing a chance to not only qualify for the postseason, but to claim the district crown. When all was said and done, Heritage and Wakeland finished atop the 9-5A standings at 6-2 with Lone Star, The Colony, Frisco and Centennial knotted at 5-3. Only Centennial entered the final week assured of a postseason spot, and the final position went the way of the Cougars following tiebreakers and a stirring comeback from 19 points down in the fourth quarter against the aforementioned Titans in both team’s finale. In addition to tightness in the standings, the depth and competitiveness of the district was consistently displayed on the field. In all, 14 games in 9-5A were decided by one score or fewer, including seven by less than a touchdown. In 2015, coaches and players alike will be well aware of the importance of each possession in 9-5A competition. Breakthrough Athlete. Mallory Adams, Centennial girls basketball. The pedigree was there all along for freshman forward Mallory Adams to establish herself as a go-to player for the Lady Titans. The younger sister of Arkansas guard McKenzie Adams and the daughter of former Razorback football player Gary Adams, Mallory shined during her inaugural varsity season. The forward averaged a double-double (18 points and 10 rebounds) before ultimately suffering a season-ending knee injury during a Jan. 20 game against Frisco. Adams’ importance was evident in an ensuing stretch that saw Centennial lose six of its next seven games, including a 52-26 bi-district contest against McKinney to spell the end of its season. The Lady Titans had previously tallied a 22-4 record with a 9-1 mark against 9-5A opponents seemingly setting up a rematch against Liberty for at least a share of the district championship. That rematch was voided with Centennial’s skid following the Adams injury. However, the freshman made an indelible mark on the program before her season came to an end. Adams showed her promise early in district action by pouring in at least 20 points during each of the first three games, including a 26-point effort against Independence on Dec. 12. Adams will now look to recover from a torn ACL and expects to be ready for Centennial’s season opener, with the Lady Titans the most likely team to end Liberty’s run of district titles. Best Performance. Kene Nwangwu, Heritage football. The Heritage football team found itself in an offensive shootout during the bi-district round of the playoffs this season. The Coyotes and Wylie East combined for 140 points while racking up nearly 1,400 yards of total offense in the win-or-go-home game. Leading that attack was junior running back Kene Nwangwu, who ran for 380 yards while finding the end zone a career-high seven times. Those efforts allowed Heritage to come away with a 77-63 victory – the school’s first in program history – and ultimately go three rounds deep in the playoffs. Nwangwu broke free for six touchdown runs of at least 30 yards, with a 72-yard first-quarter scamper becoming the junior’s longest carry of the night. For the game, Nwangwu averaged 17.27 yards per carry on 22 attempts. Nwangwu’s dominance in the ground game also opened things up for senior quarterback Malik Walker, who completed 20-of-28 passes for 320 yards and three touchdowns. The wide receiver duo of Keaton White and Bubba Ogbebor benefitted as well, with White hauling in six passes for 158 yards and one touchdown, while Ogbebor caught five balls for 113 yards and two scores. Nwangwu also caught one of Walker’s 28 pass attempts for good measure, helping Heritage rack up 795 yards of total offense.",

    "LabBody": "At least nine amendments to the county charter, or constitution, are headed to the November ballot, including a plan initiated with the Whatcom County Council to redistrict the county and possibly change the face of the council. Council voted 6 to 1 on Tuesday, July 7, to ask voters if they want to change the current three-district map to five districts. The current map has the county sliced up like a pie, with each of the three wedges containing a piece of Bellingham. While boundaries for a five-district system have yet to be drawn, the proposal has Bellingham getting two districts to itself, with the rest of the county divided into three more districts. In addition to the five-district plan, voters will consider an amendment in November that would replace countywide voting for council members with district-only voting. Under district-only voting, candidates need only appeal to voters in their third of the county — or fifth, if the five-district proposal is adopted. With either district-only or countywide voting, council members need to live in the district they represent. In the present three-district system, two council members come from each district and one is “at large” and can live anywhere in the county. In the five-district proposal, one council member would come from each district and two would be at large. It is commonly accepted by rural residents and conservatives that district-only voting with three districts would suit them best. While the current District 1 — the south county, South Fork Valley and south Bellingham — is heavily liberal, the other two districts in the northeast and northwest county lean conservative. So district-only voting could secure a 4-3 majority for rural conservatives, although that is far from certain. The same logic governs some conservative arguments against five districts, even though three of five would represent the more conservative small cities and rural areas. The two Bellingham districts and the two at-large seats likely would give progressives a 4-3 majority, conservatives say, because the countywide races for the at-large seats would be decided by Bellingham voters. “The amendment absolutely guarantees control of the entire county by the city of Bellingham,” said Jim Dickinson of Lummi Island during the two-hour, 10-minute County Council hearing Tuesday on the five-district amendment. “The city of Bellingham has so much of a larger population point that there is no way that the three rural districts will get anything out of this at all,” Dickinson said. Council member Carl Weimer, who voted with the majority to give voters the chance to decide on five districts, said concerns about Bellingham deciding the at-large races were unfounded. He recalled that two of the past four at-large council members, Marlene Dawson and Bill Knutzen, were conservatives. “If you look at the at-large seat that everybody is so worried about that Bellingham controls, I guess the Bellingham voters are really stupid because they haven’t done a very good job of controlling it,” Weimer said. Council member Pete Kremen also noted that Knutzen won an at-large seat, and that Kathy Kershner, a conservative, won from liberal District 1 under countywide voting. He used those examples to explain why he would be the lone council vote against putting the five-district measure on the ballot. Council needs at least five votes to put any charter amendment on the ballot. “Keep it the way it is. It works, and don’t tinker and be cavalier,” Kremen said. Council member Rud Browne said before the vote that his support for the five-district proposal would be based on the popular interest in the idea. Tim Douglas, who introduced the five-district proposal on behalf of RE Sources for Sustainable Communities at the June 23 council meeting, on Tuesday handed in more than 2,100 signatures RE Sources had gathered on petitions favoring five districts. A recurring comment from the public and council members who supported five districts was “let the voters decide.” “This is just another example of trusting the voters, putting out a good measure I think that’s not competing with district-only voting,” council member Barry Buchanan said. While voters are trusted to make decisions in our democracy, Buchanan said, they will need to do some work to understand what will be at least nine charter amendments on the November ballot. “The voters are going to really have to dig in and educate themselves,” he said. The Charter Review Commission, which is elected and convenes once a decade, voted to place eight amendments on the November ballot at its final meeting on Monday, July 6. Controversy clouded the commission’s last meeting, which was rescheduled late last week from Monday, July 13. The sudden change sparked protests among those considered to be in the commission’s progressive minority. While some had schedule conflicts on July 6, others boycotted the meeting or attended but refused to vote. Conservative commission Chairman Ben Elenbaas said he asked for the meeting to be moved so the County Council would know what charter amendments the commission was proposing before the council considered its own. Council had four charter amendments before it on Tuesday but passed only one, the five-district proposal. RE Sources, the environmental advocacy group that sponsored the five-district proposal, said it wasn’t motivated by any political advantage. “Democracy works best with a level playing field, and fair, responsive representation,” RE Sources Executive Director Crina Hoyer said in an email to The Bellingham Herald. “We are supportive of each and every voters’ right to good representation, no matter what their political stripe or where they live in Whatcom County.”",

    "LabBody": "TRUMBULL -- Throughout the District 2 playoffs, the Westport Little League 12-year-old All-Stars have shown they can score runs in bunches. They used that formula Friday as Mark Roszkowski's three-run shot highlighted an eight-run second inning that carried Westport to 10-7 victory over Fairfield American in the winner's bracket final at Unity Park. Roszkowski also belted a two-run homer for five RBIs and earned the win with four-plus innings on the mound, settling down after allowing four runs over the first two innings. \"I just wanted to be laser focused when I was pitching,\" said Roszkowski, who fell behind 4-0 after giving up a three-run homer to Patrick Kilbride in the second. \"I just took a breath (after allowing the homer),\" he added. \"I just looked around, I looked at all the people. It kind of soothed my stomach and I went from there.\" Westport needs only one victory to win its second district title in three years and will be off until Thursday as its awaits the survivor from the loser's bracket. \"We're honored and humbled to be here (in the finals),\" Westport manager Jack Flynn said. \"That was a great team we defeated this evening and our work is not done. We have to win seven games to advance. We've won six.\" Fairfield American, which has won four of the last five district titles, will take on Fairfield National in the loser's bracket final on Monday at 5:30 p.m. The winner of that game would then have to beat Westport twice in the double-elimination tournament to advance to the sectionals. \"After we went up 4-0, I think we tightened up a bit and started swinging at pitches that weren't in our wheelhouse,\" Fairfield American manager Matt Lawlor said. The first two batters reached for Fairfield American in the top of the first as Kyle Stevenson singled, advanced on two wild pitches and scored on Nick Morris' infield single. Roszkowski limited the damage by inducing Ryan Cowles to hit a grounder to shortstop Josh DeDomenico, who stepped on second and threw to first for a double play. After Kilbride's big hit, Westport shrugged off the 4-0 deficit as the first four batters reached Fairfield American starter Andrew Wymbs for hits in the bottom of the second. The big inning came after Westport went down in order with a pair of strikeouts as Wymbs appeared to be in control. He ended up not getting out of the second inning, however. \"Andrew had a tough night, unfortunately,\" Lawlor said. \"I probably should have pulled him a couple batters earlier but I wanted to see if he could work himself back into it.\" Alex Deutsch, who tossed the final two innings for Westport on the mound, began the comeback with a two-run homer and DeDomenico's RBI single tied the game. \"I think in the first inning they were a little blinded by the bright lights,\" Flynn said. \"Everyone can hit on this team. They kept their composure and once they got one hit off (Wymbs) it got contagious.\" Roszkowski's three-run homer snapped the 4-4 deadlock and Zach Zobel followed with a solo shot to give Westport an 8-4 lead. Fairfield American got one back on Wymbs' RBI single in the third but Roszkowsi's two-run homer extended Westport's edge to 10-5 in the fourth. \"He's just a competitor,\" Flynn said of Roszkowski. \"I've been around him for a couple years. He always has a smile on his face. He just understands the sport. I love being around the kid. He was great on the mound and he was great at the plate.\" Fairfield American pulled within 10-7 in the fifth as two runs scored on wild pitches but Deutsch pitched out of a bases-loaded threat. Deutsch then struck out of the side in the sixth and recorded five Ks in his two innings of relief.",

    "LabBody": "Gov. Scott Walker pointed the finger at Republican lawmakers Friday on a widely criticized proposal to curtail Wisconsin’s open records laws, calling it “a huge mistake” that didn’t originate in his office. “I think it was a mistake to even think about it in the budget, even though it didn’t come from us,” Walker told radio host Charlie Sykes on Friday. Walker’s office earlier this week acknowledged it helped draft the changes, which were stripped from the 2015-17 budget after a fierce outcry from conservatives and liberals alike, including a broad array of lawmakers, open government advocates and media organizations. The proposed changes, unveiled publicly hours before they were added to the budget in the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee last week, would have made secret nearly all communications and records that help the public understand how lawmakers and other public officials do their jobs. The changes would have kept secret “deliberative materials” documenting how public officials make decisions, communications and records made by lawmakers and files kept by nonpartisan lawyers who write legislation. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, said Tuesday that Walker’s office collaborated with Assembly and Senate leaders to draft the changes. Sykes, while interviewing Walker on his radio show, asked the governor to clarify his role in the process. “That was brought to us by the Legislature and they said they wanted to look at it and wanted our input,” Walker told Sykes, according to the website Right Wisconsin. “We brought up some things that we still think are legitimate in terms of records that involve things like having our staff giving you options on briefings and things like that. Not anything that’s external in that regard.” A spokeswoman for Fitzgerald said in an email Friday that he has nothing to add to his previous public remarks about the open records changes. There was no immediate response Friday to inquiries to the offices of Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and the co-chairs of Joint Finance, Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, and Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills. Vos and Nygren have said the proposed changes stemmed from a desire to protect the privacy of constituents who contact their lawmakers. On Thursday, the Wisconsin Assembly voted 96-1 to adopt a resolution aimed at reinforcing lawmakers’ commitment to open government. Lawmakers now plan to form a Legislative Council committee to study possible changes to the open records law. “I think the whole thing was a huge mistake, and I think it’s right to send it to the Legislative Council,” Walker told Sykes Friday. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers on Friday linked the proposed open records changes to Republicans’ calls for change at the Government Accountability Board, which oversees the state’s campaign finance, elections, ethics and lobbying laws. Vos and Rep. Dean Knudson, R-Hudson, called Friday for an overhaul of the agency. Nygren and Darling called for its director, Kevin Kennedy, to step down after the Wall Street Journal editorial page reported the board, while looking into the activities of conservative groups in Wisconsin, was in contact with the Internal Revenue Service. The Journal said Kennedy’s emails show he’s friends with Lois Lerner, the former IRS supervisor who was a central figure in that agency’s review of conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status. “We have repeatedly seen unethical behavior from the very agency that is supposed to be the state authority on ethics and elections,” Vos said in a news release. Democratic Assembly Leader Peter Barca of Kenosha said those efforts by GOP lawmakers, coupled with the attempt to roll back open records laws, show they want to curtail transparency at the Capitol. “It is deeply disturbing that a week after trying to dismantle our state’s open records laws and a day after Assembly Republicans refused to pledge not to degrade Wisconsin’s open records law in the future, Republicans are again attacking our state’s nonpartisan government oversight agency,” Barca said.",

    "LabBody": "The State Coastal Zone Management Authorities (SCZMA) of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have topped in granting clearances to proposed projects in last two decades. A recent report by the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) and Namati, titled “Coastal Zone Management Authorities (CZMAs) and Costal Environments: Two decades of regulating land use change on India’s coastline” shows that Gujarat topped the list with 93% rate of project clearance, with only one project was rejected out of 76 proposals. Interestingly, all proposals were to build jetty, port, industry etc. unlike rest of the States, where several proposals were pertaining to repairing or reconstruction. Tamil Nadu has the second highest rate of project clearance with 86%. It is followed by Andhra Pradesh (85%) and Karnataka (85%), while Odisha featured at the bottom in this list with 70% rate. In case of Karnataka and Goa, where the total number of proposals received is much higher, 1310 and 1297 respectively, majority are of renovation, reconstruction and repairing. As per the report since the time they were set up, the nine SCZMAs have examined over 4,500 project proposals. On an average, 15 projects (in which, at times, hundreds of small repair, reconstruction or individual housing needs are clubbed under one project head) are considered in a meeting, lasting half a working day. The study analyses the structure, functioning and performance of CZMAs, by using data from over 350 CZMA meetings between January 1999 and March 2014. It relies on 39 interviews with sitting and ex-members of the CZMAs and staff, consultants and officers of the MoEFCC in charge of implementation of the CRZ Notification and analyses the functioning of CZMAs on their key tasks - project appraisals, coastal zone mapping, action against violations and conservation of coastal areas. If one blames the environmental laws and authorities to delay the approval of projects along India’s coastline, the report challenges the apprehensions. Rate of approval The rate of approval for the projects in the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) across the nine coastal States is 80%. “However, this does not mean that the remaining 20% are rejected: out of this 20%, a large proportion is of cases that are deferred, dropped, closed or kept pending without a decision,” says the report. The SCZMAs, which were constituted to take crucial decisions regarding the use of coastal lands and the management of coastal environments, conducted site visits to only 8% of the total number of projects seen. “It is not mandatory to visit each and every site as per the law, but we have pointed out that there are no clear guidelines at all on handling this issue,” Meenakshi Kapoor, one of the authors of the report told The Hindu. She noted that the authorities cannot just rely on maps and site visits are necessary to avoid on ground violations, which do occur in many cases. The report further noted the sombre condition on post-clearance monitoring by the SCZMAs as none of the States had uploaded the half-yearly compliance reports received from the project proponents on their respective websites as required under the CRZ notification, 2011. Poor post-clearance monitoring can also be the reason of heavy workload on SCZMAs.",

In a criminal complaint filed with the office of District Judge Jennifer Nicholson, state police said that at least one of the suspects, Wallace, was familiar with the murder victim in connection with a charge of making terroristic threats against Swillings. Police said the terroristic threats charge stemmed from a debt of about $4,000 that Wallace owed Swillings, who was accused of threatening to kill Wallace. Police said surveillance footage from May 1 showed Swillings left a New Castle residence on Pin Oak Drive where he had been staying. A resident of that home said Swillings had taken a large amount of money and had planned on returning to Detroit for a short time. Swillings then left in a vehicle with an unidentified person. About 8:30 that morning, witnesses reported seeing a vehicle similar to the one in which Swillings left the Pin Oak Drive residence near the area where Swillings' body was found. Based on interviews with witnesses and surveillance footage from a nearby convenience store, police said Melissa Aponte picked up Swillings that morning at Pin Oak Drive. Police said she had instructions from Wallace to drive along Hoffmaster Road, where Avery and Ricardo Aponte were waiting with a second vehicle that had the hood up to appear as if it were disabled. Police said Melissa Aponte pulled off at the second vehicle, and Avery and Ricardo Aponte ordered Swillings out of the first vehicle at gunpoint. They then reportedly robbed Swillings and shot him fatally before driving off. The four then drove to Alabama, where they were taken into custody by authorities in that state prior to their extradition to Pennsylvania.",

    "LabBody": "First, it was Greece garnering front-page headlines about an imminent financial disaster. Then China took over when its stock market plunged so dramatically that trading was abruptly stopped. Who’s worse off? And should Americans be worried? By any almost measure, it’s Greece that’s in far worse shape. Unemployment is a sky-high 25 percent — and for young people, it’s an astonishing 50 percent. And it’s in a terrible spiral of growing debt and shrinking income. China, on the other hand, is still hitting its growth targets, even if doing so is becoming more difficult. But even though Greece is in a far more desperate situation, it’s China’s troubles that U.S. policymakers need to keep a closer eye on. Even if its sliding share prices are just a market correction, there are signs in Beijing that serious trouble is lurking not too far away. And if China’s trouble is serious, it will matter a lot more. While Greece is mired in a depression that it is unlikely to escape anytime soon, economists believe that the crisis is contained. European leaders have, it seems, successfully reduced the exposure of European banks to Greek debt. The same goes for the United States. U.S. companies are not heavily invested in Greek debt; Greece just isn’t a big trading partner. China, on the other hand, is important. It’s the world second-largest economy, a nation whose growth has fueled the global economy in recent years. If it were to significantly slow, the reverberations would be felt around the globe. China’s stock market isn’t the top risk; the Chinese market is not nearly as important for Chinese companies as U.S. equity markets are for American firms. And even with the recent losses, the Shanghai Composite index is still up more than 75 percent in the past year. But the rapid drop in equity prices underlines the weaknesses in the Chinese economy long-term. “The Chinese economy has some very significant imbalances,” Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist, said. “You see that in the property markets [and] in the banking system. And this is just another example of that. Runaway speculation, surge in margin debt and now a subsequent collapse in equity markets are all symptomatic of significant excess imbalance.” Those imbalances have led to growth in China in recent years that many analysts see as unsustainable. And in an interconnected world, a slumping China is a lot more important than a bankrupt Greece. Added Zandi: “It also highlights that Chinese authorities may not have as much control over things as we might think they do.” In other words, don’t worry about this market crash; worry about the next one.",

    "LabBody": "MANILA - Just a few years back, Howard Chan was a young college student struggling to support his studies, working on various jobs, including a stint as service crew for a fast food restaurant in a mall in Baguio City. Chan remembers very well how he was laughed at -- ridiculed, even -- for his job by customers and fellow students. \"'Yung bang tipong tatawagin ka tapos papakuha ng ketchup. Pagbalik mo e papakuha ng tissue. Pagbalik mo ulit e papakuha ng tubig, and then magtatawanan sila,\" he shared to ABS-CBNnews.com. Fast forward eight years later, Chan has successfully made it through college and law school, and has also passed the Bar exams, officially becoming a lawyer. But it was at all not easy for Chan, who came from a working class family. He's got 5 siblings, his mom was a waitress and his late dad was a taxi driver in Baguio. \"We 5 siblings normally would have to fend for ourselves. By the time I was in college, my dad's jobless most of the time kasi wala nang kumukuha sa kanya na taxi operators dahil na rin sa reputation niya na alcoholic,\" he said. Service crew, house painter. Working students in fast food chains are typical, but typical does not mean easy. In fact, hard is an understatement to describe the work of a fast food employee -- especially for a student who's not as fortunate as those in the upper class of society. \"Medyo nahihiya ako, lalo na kung may mga classmates na nagiging customers. Closing shift ako noon. from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., usually,\" he said. \" I chose closing shift kasi 'yung schedule ko sa klase morning and afternoon - so para full-time pa rin ako sa klase.\" He wasn't alone, though, as he recalled many co-workers who were also students like him, struggling to make a living to pursue their dreams. \"At work, medyo physically stressful siya kasi mataas ang volume ng customers. You are either assigned sa lobby (dining area) or sa kitchen. When in the dining area, ang stressful part ay handling difficult customers. Sa kitchen, siyempre mainit, laging napapaso at nasusugat, at 'yung pressure to meet the demands of the customers,\" he shared. \"Meron din 'yung mga time na papagalitan ka ng customers for various reasons, meron din 'yung papagalitan ka ng manager kasi pinagalitan sila ng customers, so ibabaling sa amin ang frustrations nila,\" he added. All these kinds of stress, he said, were for a small amount of money. \"Maliit lang ang sweldo ng service crew,\" he said of his pay which, at the time, was at P21 per hour. Apart from being a service crew of a fast food chain, Chan took other jobs, even as a house painter for a local real estate company. \"Naging pintor din ako ng bahay for a local real estate company,\" he recalled. Tutor, call center agent. Chan said being a service crew and a house painter were only a few of the jobs he took while and after studying at Saint Louis University in Baguio City. He thought of landing a teaching job after college so he can pursue law. This prompted him to resign from the fast food chain he was working at. However, not a single job came. Chan decided to look for another way to support his studies. He tutored Koreans, but \"after one semester, I stopped because I realized I cannot finance my law studies with tutoring alone.\" Chan said he was just able to finish until the finals exam of the first semester by borrowing money from his girlfriend. \"I was only able to take up my final exams after I borrowed some money from my GF (now his wife) to pay off my tuition [around September 2008],\" he said. Chan quit school and worked as a call center agent. But after two years of taking calls, he realized something. \"I realized I did not want to spend the rest of my life that way, hence I decided to go back to law school. But this time, I enrolled at the College of Law of the University of the Cordilleras (Baguio). I maintained my working student status,\" he said. More stress. Chan was getting the hang of being a working student when he had a major roadblock again. \"On the final day of exams during my second year, second semester, my father died,\" he said. \"As I was out of focus, I failed an exam and needed to transfer to another law school because of it. I eventually transferred to the University of Baguio [where I finished law].\" Chan said his problems at work added to the stress brought about by his father's death. \"When the account I was servicing at the call center I was working at got dissolved, we were transferred to a financial account which I found difficult to handle because of the volume of calls consisting of mostly irate callers,\" he said. Eventually, the stress took a toll on Chan, so he resigned and tried to find another job again. \"Nawala ang work-school-life balance ko. Hence, I decided to resign and find another job if only to maintain my sanity,\" he said. \"I got introduced to online jobs by a friend and I ended up being a virtual assistant. Online jobs supported the remaining years of my law school until 2014, when I graduated,\" he recalled. Giving back. Recalling all the things he went through, Chan said he still could not believe that he made it as a lawyer. \"'Yung feeling na nandun na pero 'di ka pa rin makapaniwala kasi from that day on, you can finally move on to another dream, another challenge, another endeavor,\" he said. \"Cliche, pero lahat ng hirap nakalimutan. It was all worth it. I was thankful sa experience because it made me stronger and it made me look at life differently. It made me value it more,\" he added. Now that he has fulfilled his dream, Chan wants to give back and champion workers' rights. When asked what he thinks are the major issues concerning workers in the Philippines, he said: \"Contractualization.\" \"Although may batas naman that's supposed to take care of that, hindi kasi alam ng ordinaryong manggagawa, kaya they end up just looking for other jobs once nag-end of contract,\" he explained. \"Kasi isipin mo, 'pag ikaw ung ordinary worker at nag-end 'yung contract mo, at alam mong bawal 'yun, will you fight it in court or just look for another job? Sa ordinary worker, wala 'yung pera to finance a court suit,\" he added. In a blog he posted recently, Chan said his other goal is to become a \"judicious and moral lawyer,\" the kind that he admired in his times of struggle. \"When I became a lawyer, I just knew that I have to be that kind of lawyer that I admire back in the days when we were struggling. I don’t have to be the smartest or the most prominent. I just want to be one of the most judicious and moral,\" he said. Not losing hope in humanity, Chan hopes to be an agent of change with his current profession. \"Sabi nga sa isang court decision e, 'equity aids the vigilant.' Our duty as lawyers and as agents of justice is to be vigilant for others especially those who are meek who cannot fight for their own,\" he said.",

Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is trying to leave her old CIA life behind her on the upcoming fifth season of Homeland, but that may be easier said than done.

Oh, Carrie, we've heard that one before.

    "LabBody": "Shay Youngblood traveled to Japan in 2011 to research a novel on memory and home. Ten days later, a 9.0 earthquake struck, followed by a tsunami and nuclear fallout. “It was very unsettling to be there – and heartbreaking and sad,” she said. “Although I was not in a place with physical damage, there was a lot of emotional trauma.” Now Youngblood has turned those emotions into a performance piece, “Add Architecture, Stir Memory,” which she will present from 6:30 to 8 p.m. Aug. 4 (Tuesday) at UNT on the Square. The production uses a mixture of interviews, animation, live action, video and soundscapes she recorded in Japan. Youngblood is the author of the novels \"Black Girl in Paris\" and \"Soul Kiss\" and the plays \"Amazing Grace,\" \"Shakin' the Mess Outta Misery\" and \"Talking Bones.\" The Dallas Observer named her one of the area’s Top 100 Creatives of 2015. She is a former career advisor at the University of North Texas. As part of a five-month residency with the Japan-United States Friendship Commission, Youngblood was visiting Tokyo to speak with architects and creative professionals about their culture and the effect of the memory of home. She was on the sixth floor of an apartment building when the earthquake struck. “It just felt like five minutes of intense shaking,” she said. “I didn’t know if building was going to crumble.” While Tokyo did not sustain a lot of physical damage, other parts of the country saw cars and buildings destroyed and towns washed away. “The novel paled to these real life moments that were happening,” she said. “So many people had lost their homes. What does it mean to have lost not only your home and loved ones but your entire community?” Youngblood explores that in her piece by asking people, and even asking them to draw, what home means to them. She noted some people talked about very specific places, such as a fireplace and staircase. For the piece, Youngblood worked with Adam Chamberlin, professor of lighting and sound at UNT’s Department of Dance and Theatre, and sound designer Gabriel Vega, a recent UNT new media graduate from UNT’s College of Visual Arts and Design. The piece was first performed in Austin and received funding from an IndieGoGo campaign, a Texas Commission on the Arts grant and the Allgo non-profit organization. She would like to take the performance piece to Tokyo and other venues around the country. The project has personal meaning to Youngblood, who has lived in Hawaii, Japan and New York. “Wherever I happened to be, I was home,” she said. “I have to say this project just made it clear how deeply impressed we are. We take home wherever it is, wherever we go.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "While being single may seem difficult, we can find happiness in the dating process as we improve ourselves and our outlook on life. Last year, it was reported that single people in America now outnumber married people. There are many theories and ideas about why this is. One might think that it would be easier to find a soul mate because of online dating sites, but it seems that this has changed our millennial mindset, making us pickier than ever. Read: The most overlooked characteristic of who you want to marry The research group Euromonitor even predicts that by 2020, there will be 48 million new single residents, an uptick of over 20 percent of the current number. Notwithstanding, many of us still crave companionship, a void that nothing else in life can seem to fill. The dating game can be exhausting and frustrating, especially when we experience repeated breakups, which causes real, actual grief. Once this grief is properly addressed, which can include therapy, we still may be left asking ourselves, \"Why am I still single?\" My experience has shown me that usually it's not other people; it's me who needs to change. When I say this, I don't mean that we need to change who we are; rather, change what we're doing and why we're doing it. 1. Make it a matter of prayer Communing with God to better understand His plan for you can help you find peace in a brutal world. Consider that God's ways are higher than ours; He has a plan for each of us. God wants us to talk with Him. By putting Him at the forefront of our dating lives, asking Him questions, and turning to holy scripture for answers, we'll perhaps find some of the answers to why we haven't married yet. God does want us to marry, have families and learn to become like Him. Seek His guidance in what it will take to get to that point. 2. Meet as many people as possible Years ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a goal to go on dates with 50 girls. I remember exclaiming that was a lot. He then told me that he wanted to go out with as many people as possible to learn what he did and didn't like. He kept a journal of these dates, and started to notice a consistent theme in his preferences. My friend never made it to his goal of 50, because along the way, he met his wife. By the time she came along, it was apparent to my friend that this wonderful woman would make an excellent companion. He moved quickly and asked her to marry him. She accepted, and they have a wonderful life and a cute little boy. From this experience, it's apparent that putting ourselves out there will broaden our opportunities. If my friend hadn't been going places where he knew he could meet quality girls, he wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet and date his wife. Use every avenue possible to put yourself in front of people. As you are out there, remember that you may get rejected from time to time. That's OK. Take those experiences, learn from them, then move on to meeting more people. If you follow this pattern, you'll find rejection happens less and less. 3. Make a list of qualities you find attractive Also, make a list of things that aren't attractive to you. From these two lists, pick three things you absolutely must have, three things you absolutely can't stand and then discard the rest. No one is perfect, so simply focus on the values and attributes in a person that are most important to you. Finally, make a third list, but make it about you. What do you need to do to be deserving of this ideal mate? Only you can answer these questions, but seeking out the advice of family and close friends in this regard will help you narrow down your best and worst qualities. From this final list, make any necessary changes in your personal behavior, and hold yourself accountable to someone (such as a parent or best friend) to measure your progess. During this time, it's important that you keep dating, because this will give you realtime feedback about your improvements. 4. Be kind and stay positive Kindness goes a long way, especially in the dating realm. This isn't to say that you should go on a pity date with everyone who shows interest; rather, politely declining an invitation in a kind way will do a lot for your personal self worth, and it will make it easier to stay within your preferences. Read: 10 signs you’re in the right relationship Staying positive can be tough, especially if it's been a while since you've been in a relationship, but focus on the good things in your life. Keep your friends and family close; exercise; read; expand your hobbies and talents. Eventually, for most of us, the right person does come along. Until then, if you are the very best person you can be, you can find happiness in the single life.

    "LabBody": "Roll Call Staff. July 10, 2015, 3:30 p.m. Gilead Sciences Inc., the maker of the costly Sovaldi hepatitis C pill that has attracted congressional scrutiny, bought doctors about $3.6 million worth of food and drink last year, according to a CQ Roll Call analysis of a federal database that tracks how much drug and medical device companies spend on physicians and hospitals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data from 2014 covers about 11.4 million financial transactions attributed to more than 600,000 physicians and more than 1,100 teaching hospitals. Company payments, including consulting fees and gifts, total $6.5 billion, the CMS said in a release. Known as the Open Payments database, the information is designed to let consumers know more about their doctors’ relationships with companies whose products they prescribe. Spearheaded by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, the program is a reaction to past criticism of cozy relationships between some health providers and manufacturers. The database allows users to drill into how much an individual doctor received in consulting payments, or even food and drink, on a certain day. For Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead, among the biggest “food and beverage” expenses for last year was $600.68 for a Phoenix doctor who is a noted activist in treating HIV, a field in which the company sells several products. This payment covered meals consumed over several days, said Michele Rest, a Gilead spokeswoman said in an email. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in 2002 put voluntary limits on what kinds of meals drugmakers can offer doctors, after the industry drew criticism for providing hospitality with little focus on teaching physicians about medicines. “Gilead abides by internal meal and other hospitality limits adopted along with generally accepted industry practices,” Rest wrote in the email. “These hospitality limits are revisited on a regular basis to ensure they are within acceptable bounds and are adherent to the overall goal of offering modest hospitality that is secondary to a legitimate business interaction.” The database shows about two-thirds of Gilead’s more than 130,000 reported “food and beverage” transactions costing less than $20. Of these, Gilead reported more than 1,600 transactions listed as costing less than $1.25, with some showing for as little as six cents. These entries reflect the accounting rules for the CMS database, Rest said. Companies are required to report individual expenses of more than $10 to CMS. If multiple individual $10 expenses add up to more than $100 over a year, then all payments under $10 must be reported, including expenses less than $1, such as cups of coffee, Rest said. Grassley welcomed the release of a new set of payment data. “There’s a strong public interest in knowing where this money goes and why,” Grassley said in a statement, without identifying specific companies. “Consumers, researchers and other members of the public benefit from disclosure.“ Separately, Grassley and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., as senior members of the Senate Finance Committee, are taking a close look at Gilead’s pricing of Sovaldi, which reached the market with an eye-catching initial price of $1,000 a pill. The original developer of Sovaldi, which Gilead acquired in 2012, expected to profitably sell the drug in the United States for $36,000, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents cited by Wyden and Grassley. But Gilead set the price at about $84,000 per treatment regimen, and the two senators noted that some patients will need longer treatments that would cost twice that amount. comments powered by",

    "DiffbotBody": "A joint letter sent by human rights groups to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of enhanced interrogation techniques revealed by a Senate report released late last year. The letter, signed by Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International, asked Lynch’s office to investigate “torture and other violations of U.S. law” in connection to the programs. A petition with 111,788 signatures was attached to the joint letter. In the six months since the Senate report was released, the letter says, the Obama administration hasn’t taken any steps to criminally investigate the interrogation practices. “The Justice Department has a clear responsibility to carry out a credible and comprehensive criminal investigation into the overwhelming evidence that U.S. officials used torture in violation of U.S. law,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, in a press release. “The Obama administration’s continued failure to act in the face of this mountain of evidence risks sending the message that torture is a valid policy option rather than the crime that it is.” The Department of Justice, in a statement provided to International Business Times, said that it looked into the programs in both 2009 and again after the torture report was released. \"In 2009, the Attorney General directed a preliminary review of the treatment of certain individuals alleged to have been mistreated while in U.S. Government custody subsequent to the 9/11 attacks. That review generated two criminal investigations, but the Department of Justice ultimately declined those cases for prosecution because the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain convictions beyond a reasonable doubt,\" a spokesman said in an email. \"Those investigators have also reviewed the Senate Committee’s full report and did not find any new information that they had not previously considered in reaching their determination. This inquiry was extraordinarily thorough and we stand by our previously announced decision not to initiate criminal charges.\" The Senate report, released in December, detailed a program that began soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. An initial memo authorized the CIA with considerable discretion over whom to detain in intelligence-gathering operations. From there, and through subsequent memos, the CIA and U.S. intelligence operations were able to establish secret detention centers. Under the rationale that the combatants captured in the war on terror were not protected as prisoners of war under the Geneva convention, a set of so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as waterboarding were used to force information from prisoners. The interrogation techniques were discontinued through executive action soon after President Barack Obama took office. The report set off a heated public debate, and critics of the program pointed to scant evidence that the interrogation techniques, which were often characterized as torture, had led to significant, reliable intelligence. Earlier this month, the Senate voted to ban waterboarding and \"rectal feeding,\" which would permanently extend Obama’s executive order. “We must continue to insist that the methods we employ in this fight for peace and freedom must always, always, be as right and honorable as the goals and ideals we fight for,” said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a former of prisoner of war. The torture ban was part of a bigger National Defense Authorization Act that the Senate ultimately passed overwhelmingly. A final version of the bill could be passed in early July.",

    "LabBody": "Tuesday’s Waco City Council vote outlawing smoking in local bars, restaurants and most other enclosed public places should remind business owners of the need to keep up with changing trends. Waco is but the latest of more than 35 cities in Texas to embrace citywide smoking bans, mostly approved in spite of loud claims about the rights of smokers. Even state legislators refuse to forbid it. Change here was bound to happen — and savvy business owners knew it. The fact Sammy Citrano, owner of George’s Restaurant \u0026 Bar and long the voice of the Waco Restaurant Association, was missing from the list of those speaking against the proposed ordinance Tuesday was indication of how the council’s 5-1 vote would go. “Tobacco and smoking kills more than AIDS, crack, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, car accidents, fire, murder and suicide combined, and it’s entirely preventable,” said Philip Huang, medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department. “And secondhand smoke is a significant issue related to this.” Attention was given to those who work in smoking areas, including college students. Yet some testimony at Tuesday’s meeting as well as a council meeting last month should remind public leaders there is often a business cost to policymaking, especially for businesses that invested to comply with earlier ordinances. In this case, a handful of local establishments opted to fund construction providing for separately ventilated smoking areas to satisfy the last major city smoking ordinance passed in 2002 and then revised in 2009. Health experts now say these are not a full safeguard. One knew matters were turning desperate for operators of bars, pool halls and restaurants based on some of the arguments offered Tuesday, including those by Nick Alexander, owner of Clicks Billiards, which has had a presence in Waco for 25 years. At one point, he cited last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the Environmental Protection Agency, in drawing up Clean Air Act rules for power plants, had to consider the costs involved in complying. Nice try. “Pool players and smoking go together,” he said. “I don’t like it. I’d prefer that they didn’t. Tonight we’ll have a hundred people in our place playing in a league. These people do not belong to country clubs. They do not own bass boats. Their recreation is to come and play pool, and they’ll be there for four hours. Eighty percent of them smoke. They should be considered.” This newspaper proposed that businesses with independently ventilated smoking areas be grandfathered or given a grace period to save them the cost of their investments. Possibly, though, all this is a trade-off involving other savings, from everything from absenteeism caused by smokers readily flattened by colds and flus to insurance and medical costs for heart disease and cancer. But the fact this ordinance passed in an era when Texans are so quick to demand their rights suggests it was really just a matter of time.",

Athletics hardly ever pause for holidays, so my past sports jobs have always involved either writing from coverage of some holiday tournament or working on the desk doing page design (oftentimes because the staff was shorthanded thanks to summer vacations). Those other years as a small-town newspaper editor (which also always involved sports) left me with Fourth of July activities to cover … there was always a parade, fireworks and a celebration. I remember stepping outside of newsrooms in the late hours to see a glimpse of fireworks in the distance as I waited for some late West Coast baseball game to get finished so the box score could be included on the Scoreboard page. But with Philomath shooting off its fireworks this coming Friday night following the rodeo and the parade scheduled during the Frolic on Saturday morning, I actually could sit back and relax a little. The Philomath Classic Car Show even changed its schedule to the second Saturday of the month. For the first time in forever, I actually had an open Saturday. Thanks, Philomath. Should we go down to the riverfront in Corvallis and see what that’s all about, I wondered? Should we go catch a fireworks show somewhere? We decided no on both counts to avoid the crowds. We ended up having a quiet dinner at a nearby restaurant and then going home. We figured we’d see our fireworks the following weekend in Philomath and we’re thinking we’ll be doing plenty of “Frolic-ing.” As for not working, I almost did it. But my wife stepped out for a couple hours to go swimming with her friends, so I took the opportunity at home alone to get my sports page finished with a feature on Haidyn Ecker, a D1 baseball roundup and a rodeo preview. So, yeah, I worked but it just meant I didn’t have to get that finished on Sunday.",

DONALD TRUMP: It is none of your business, it is really none of your business. I have a license to have a gun. NBC: Gun control. DONALD TRUMP: What are you talking about?

NuSTAR, launched in 2012, is an orbiting X-ray observatory originally designed to track distant supernovas and black holes. (Video via NASA) But it can also collect X-ray images of our own sun in unprecedented detail. When its data is combined with readings from the ultraviolet Solar Dynamics Observatory, you get this: (Video via NASA) A sort of heat map of the sun. Its surface measures millions of degrees Fahrenheit, but it’s not evenly heated throughout. NuSTAR has spotted even hotter spots, which researchers say are the work of microflares. These are like solar flares, but on a much smaller scale. They don’t launch explosions of energy and matter away from the Sun, but they are thought to make parts of the corona — the Sun’s atmosphere, basically — hot enough to stand out in the X-ray spectrum. (Video via NASA) And they’re not well-understood, yet. Researchers plan to use NuSTAR’s cameras to study these tiny flares in more detail, and hunt for evidence of even smaller bursts called nanoflares.

    "LabBody": "CHEYENNE — A judge sentenced a Wyoming prison inmate Thursday to an additional 35 years behind bars for trying to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather while incarcerated. Andrew Silicani, 23, wanted to collect their life insurance and inherit their house, prosecutor said. U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal imposed the additional sentence, saying it was heartbreaking that Silicano wanted to kill his mother after she had supported him through a lifetime of mental health problems. \"For what? For a new car, 10 tattoos and for drugs?\" the judge asked him. \"To exchange a life for such juvenile desires is hard to comprehend.\" Cheryl Lambert, Silicani's mother, told Freudenthal the sentencing hearing was the saddest day of her life. Lambert also said she and her husband, John Ott, feared Silicani would try to kill them again if he ever were released. \"You are my son and I love you forever,\" Lambert said. \"Now my real grieving begins as I learn to let go of you, my son and my only child.\" Silicani was serving five to seven years in state prison for two robbery convictions, including one in which a victim was stabbed, when he tried to arrange the murders for hire. He will serve the federal sentence after his state term, which expires at the latest in 2018. According to an FBI agent's statement, a confidential source contacted the Rawlins prison where Silicani was being held in November to report that Silicani had asked if the source would be willing to kill Silicani's parents. Another FBI agent began posing as the hit man and reported Silicani told him he didn't want to pay more than $100,000 for what he called \"demolition work.\" Silicani expected to receive $850,000 in life insurance and property, according to court records. The confidential source told law enforcement that Silicani said he planned to buy \"a Cadillac Escalade, clothes and jewelry.\" Silicani pleaded guilty in April to four counts of using the mail in trying to hire someone to carry out the murders. His attorney, James Barrett, said after Thursday's hearing that he planned to appeal the 35-year sentence. Silicani, a slight man with sharp features and close-cropped black hair, stood Thursday before Freudenthal wearing orange jail clothing, shackled at the wrists and ankles. Addressing his parents, Silicani said, \"Even if you don't believe me, I want you to know that I have no intention of hurting either of you.\"",

    "LabBody": "More than four million Syrians have fled abroad since the 2011 outbreak of civil war, the largest number from any crisis in almost 25 years, the United Nations said yesterday. A recent wave of people leaving Syria and an update of Turkish statistics confirmed the tragic milestone, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. The agency said 7.6 million additional people have been displaced from their homes within Syria by the fighting. The four million refugees are the most to flee a conflict since the Afghan civil war forced 4.6 million out of their country, beginning in 1992. \"This is the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation,\" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said. \"It is a population that needs the support of the world but is instead living in dire conditions and sinking deeper into poverty.\" The flow of refugees is accelerating only 10 months after the agency said more than three million Syrians had fled their country. Turkey has borne much of the impact. In June alone, according to UNHCR, more than 24,000 people arrived from northern Syria amid fighting between the Isil group and Kurdish militants. The total of more than 1.8 million Syrians in Turkey have made it the biggest host of refugees in the world, an expensive undertaking that Turkey is bearing mostly on its own. \"What are we going to be facing in another year's time?\" Andrew Harper, the UNHCR chief in Jordan, said. Harper emphasised that countries involved had to figure out ways to keep the Syrian refugees productive. \"We should make sure that the people who are here, the skills, the work, the ability, are not wasted,\" Harper said. \"We do not want to warehouse the refugee population of four million. Just imagine the amount of productivity they could contribute to an economy.\" The dire situation is pushing a wave of Syrian refugees to escape to Western Europe, taking increasingly risky paths across the Mediterranean as European countries resist the flow of migrants and refugees. \"We cannot afford to let them (the refugees) and the communities hosting them slide further into desperation,\" Mr Guterres said. Meanwhile, it also emerged yesterday that more than 200 Americans have travelled or attempted to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic militants, Federal Bureau of Investigation chief James Comey has confirmed. \"We continue to identify individuals who seek to join the ranks of foreign fighters ... and also homegrown violent extremists who may aspire to attack the United States from within,\" Mr Comey told lawmakers on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The radicalisation of Americans by Isil (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) is a top concern for the agency, and earlier on Wednesday Comey urged technology companies to allow law enforcement authorities access to encrypted communications to help combat the problem.

In the end, it's not that what Grande did was okay, but it is funny that the media is treating a weird dare and some bad commentary as a huge scandal. Fellow media darling Courtney Love sums up the ridiculousness of all the uproar pretty well, as do a few other reactions. I think we've investigated this in the court of public opinion enough and I don't think the cops need to help us out on this one. Besides, don't the police get enough donut jokes as is?",

    "LabBody": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — About 6,500 Comic-Con conventioneers were the first to see the full trailer for the final installment of \"The Hunger Games\" series, but the playful banter between the series' three leads was the real can't-miss moment. Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, along with the film's director and producer, unveiled the trailer for \"Mockingjay-Part 2\" Thursday at the annual pop-culture celebration. The camaraderie between the stars was obvious as they shared the stage inside the San Diego Convention Center's largest meeting hall. When Hutcherson said being part of \"The Hunger Games\" was \"the most incredible movie-making experience, and just experience in my life, getting to know these people,\" Lawrence and Hemsworth playfully petted his face. \"He's a sweet, sweet angel,\" Hemsworth cracked, adding that the two share a scene in the final film that almost hints at a bromance. \"We have this really emotional scene together,\" he said, \"and there might be a kiss between Josh and I.\" After Lawrence felt she fumbled the answer to a fan's question, Hutcherson joked he had a \"kill switch\" for her microphone. \"What have we learned over the years about me and public speaking?\" she asked rhetorically. Hosted by Conan O'Brien, who is taping his nightly talk show from Comic-Con this week, the \"Mockingjay-Part 2\" panel opened in dramatic fashion: An army of drummers dressed all in white pounded out a solemn beat as they marched through the exhibition hall. Director Francis Lawrence played the trailer at the start of the hour-long presentation, and again at the end. Fiery and battle-filled, it shows Katniss Everdeen leading a civilian army into the Capitol to take on tyrannical President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence said she hopes the film inspires young people to consider \"the power of our future is in our hands.\" The three lead actors said ending the four-film series is deeply emotional. But Lawrence feels she and Katniss are forever connected. \"Something was bestowed onto Katniss in a way that me saying yes into these movies was onto me,\" she said. \"The changes that happened in my life from doing these movies are so permanent and still with me that I don't think I'll ever say goodbye to her.\" That doesn't mean the final day of shooting wasn't heartbreaking for the three stars-turned-friends. \"There's no way to say this without starting rumors,\" Lawrence said, \"but that night we held each other and slept like puppies.\" ___ Follow AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen at www.twitter.com/APSandy .",

    "DiffbotBody": "For the last few days, we have been reporting on the controversy surrounding comments Donald Trump made about Mexico during his campaign announcement. During his speech, the legendary businessman complained about the many criminals that are sneaking into the U.S. from Mexico, calling many of them “rapists.” Outraged, the Spanish-language television channel Univision announced that they would be boycotting Trump by refusing to broadcast his Miss Universe Pageant. NBC quickly followed suit by ending their relationship with Trump on Monday. Days later, Macy’s also announced that they would be cutting ties with Trump after more than a decade of working with him. Unfazed, Trump has stood by the comments he made, saying repeatedly that the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico has become problematic. Last week, he filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision for dropping the Miss Universe pageant. This week, the establishment at the GOP has turned on Trump and tried to get him to “tone down” his opinions because they rock the boat and upset the status quo. Despite this, the good news has started to poor in for Trump and his campaign. Yesterday, it was revealed that Trump is the frontrunner GOP candidate in North Carolina. Today, polls have revealed that Trump is actually the frontrunner among Republicans nationwide. According to Mad World News, Trump is now backed by 15% of Republican voters, putting him four points ahead of Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. He is six points ahead of GOP candidates Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee. Polls show that Trump’s approval rating is particularly high among Tea Partiers, with a whopping two thirds of his supporters identifying in that group. Before Trump announced his candidacy three weeks ago, nobody expected him to become the frontrunner of the GOP race. Before his announcement, 38% of voters had a favorable view of him while 47% had an unfavorable view of him. Now, 49% of voters approve of him and 43% do not. However, some reports say that Trump’s time as frontrunner may be short-lived, as many are supporting him just to send a message to other GOP candidates. Many Republicans like Trump’s no-nonsense attitude, and they want other candidates to adopt this from him. When asked who will likely secure the nomination, however, 29% said Jeb Bush, more than twice the number that backed second place finisher Rand Paul. Trump came in with just 7% in this poll.

    "LabBody": "How many stars are there? That’s not a foolish question. It may be impossible to answer, but it keeps you wondering and hopefully a little humble. Counting the grains of sand on the beaches of the world may be easier. On any given clear, moonless night, you can see several thousand stars without the aid of a telescope or even binoculars. Unfortunately that assumes that light pollution is not much of an issue where you live, an assumption we cannot dare make. Counting the stars in a given constellation is a way to gauge the severity of light pollution, or how clear the sky is. In the entire sky in every direction, under ideal conditions, an estimated 8,000 stars are visible to unaided eyes. You will never see that many from the ground, since the Earth is under your feet! The Milky Way Galaxy has an estimated 100 billion stars. We see well less than half of them because of being situated far to one side, and that the galaxy is filled with vast clouds of cosmic dust that obscure the stars behind them. There’s over 16 Milky Way stars for every person on Earth. Consider, astronomers have estimated there may be as many as 100 billion galaxies, each one made up of billions of stars. A Goddard Space Flight Center web site estimated there are 1,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000 stars in the entire Universe. How they figure that is beyond me. That’s 10 to the 21st power, or one sextillion. How can we begin to comprehend such a large number? One sextillion is the same as a billion trillion, if that’s any help. Scanning a starry night with a telescope can sweep up millions of stars. It is an amazing sight, especially when you are looking towards the Milky Way Band, where stars are most concentrated. I never tried counting, but in some eyepiece fields, surely there are a thousand stars in your eye at once. Noticing a faint but fuzzy glow in the background, it is amazing to contemplate you are peering even deeper into the unresolved fabric of the galaxy, teeming with stars and nebulosity beyond your telescope’s ability to see as individual celestial fires. The sheer glistening of stars, many you see gleaming with hues of color, is reminiscent of the story book pirate’s treasure chest full of gems of indescribable value. Looking away from the Milky Way band with your telescope, the view still is salted with stars, although comparatively fewer. This is also a wonder, to attempt to imagine the incredible vastness not just from your backyard to the stars, but between the stars as well. Peering into the inky blackness between the stars, one can ponder the multitude of dim stars shining there but beyond reach except with larger and larger instruments. Here and there you will pick out a tiny, dim fuzzy patch. In most cases, these are distant galaxies, every one as magnificent as our own Milky Way Galaxy, many actually much bigger and containing billions more stars than in our own galactic city. With all the multitude of stars, we can relish the fact that one of them is responsible for allowing life itself to exist on the Planet Earth, our beloved sun. Every day, starlight streams through your window, and illuminates your path, even brightening the great ball of rock - the moon - orbiting our world. We call this starlight sunlight, but is starlight nonetheless. If you were to be in the vicinity of any one of these distant stars you see at night, you’d realize quickly that indeed our Sun is one of these hot balls of gas. Backing away in your imaginary starship, as far as the Alpha Centauri system- the nearest star system to our sun, you would see our star like one of the other bright stars in the sky. Alpha Centauri’s principal star is similar t pour own and glows as a zero magnitude star, one of the treasures of the far southern sky. As seen from there, the sun appears as a brilliant star in the opposite side of the celestial sphere - in what would be our northern sky, among the other stars of the constellation Cassiopeia. At once, the star traveler discovers that constellations are figments of our imagination; as your starship moves through the galaxy, familiar constellations distort and become unrecognizable. Stars, we find, are at vastly different distances, though from our earthly perspective none look any farther beyond our grasp as any other. Counting stars may seem endless, and perhaps no less than counting or blessings- in this regard, including eyes to see, a mind to consider and a heart to be glad. New moon is on July 15.

    "DiffbotBody": "Why is it that some people achieve so much more than others? Are they blessed with \"golden child\" genes or is it something more common than that? Everyone wants to know the secret to success. Hundreds of authors have written books on their idea of what the secret is, and millions have purchased those books looking for the answer. However, many people look at the big successes of people but don't really delve into the little successes and actions that got them there. Benjamin Franklin wrote out and planned every hour of his day from waking up and bathing to \"putting things in order.\" It is the daily actions of successful people, the little things that most people overlook, that get them to the top. The good news is that these habits can be encouraged at an early age. Many successful people are creatures of habit when it comes to how they plan their day, and the choices they make with their time makes all the difference in the level of success they achieve. If you aspire for a more productive day and desire a higher level of opportunties for your children in their lives, here are five habits many successful people do on a daily basis. 1. Have a morning routine This seems like a tedious and minuscule aspect of someone's day, but the truth is, a morning routine has a positive effect on your day. That feeling encourages you to cross something off your list and leaves you feeling accomplished. The purpose of your routine should be to prepare for the day as well as to get started on accomplishing tasks. Not everything you do will be something you enjoy, but you can mix it up with things that get the dopamine flowing, like having your favorite muffin for breakfast. By adapting a morning routine for your children, they have an opportunity to mentally prepare for the demands of the day. An organized morning eliminates misplaced homework, wasted time chasing down a lost shoe, and allows your child time to concentrate on the demands of the day. 2. Have a to-do list Many people overlook the value of having a to-do list. Yet, it provides a localized place where everything you need to do is written down. One of the simple pleasures of the day is being able to cross off a task when completed. By keeping up with your list, you tend to automatically fall into a mode of productivity, which keeps running throughout the day. Put the things you absolutely need to accomplish at the top, followed by the things you need to complete soon, ending with the things that do not have a close deadline. But start the list with something easy to complete, giving yourself a little dose of accomplishment that gets you a head start on your list. Many schools now encourage the use of a daily planner for their students to keep track of upcoming assignments and test schedules. By utilizing a to-do list, and reviewing it regularly, your child won't be caught unprepared for an upcoming midterm or research paper. 3. Do the things you hate first \"Do your chores, then you can play with your friends.\" This childhood motto still holds true for adults. Try getting the tedious and most disliked tasks out of the way. You'll feel the weight come off your shoulders, and you will be able to enjoy the tasks you like even more when you know you don't have the unpleasant ones hanging over your head. On top of that, the day will seem to go by much faster after you've eliminated the not-so-fun tasks. 4. Focus on the positives So often in life we are prepared to perform our best, yet things don't go our way. Despite our efforts, we still took second in debate, we didn't make the basketball team, we didn't get accepted to the school of our choice. Life is filled with disappointments and setbacks. If you focus on the things you are good at and the positive aspects of the day it will alter your mood to reflect your positive thinking, and things will begin to change. An important lesson for your children is to realize that life will require a need to adapt. Yet, you can continue forward by focusing on the successes you have had. Don't let negativity consume your thinking. Remember, a ship (you) can be sunk by a single puncture if it continues to let in more water (negativity). 5. Visualize Jack Nicklaus is often referred to as the greatest golfer of all time. Throughout a 25-year professional career that included winning 18 major golf championships, Nicklaus practiced visualization with every shot. He mentally played the hole before he ever picked up his club to swing. \"Sometimes the biggest problem is in your head. You've got to believe you can play a shot instead of wondering where your next bad shot is coming from,\" he said. Envisioning your success is vital. It enables you to focus on your goals and get your mind thinking positively. \"The man who thinks he can, and the man who thinks he can't, are both usually right.\" Athletes in all sports are instructed to visualize their next at-bat or their next goal because it truly does have a significant effect on the outcome. For many of us, the pathway to success may seem out of reach or reserved for those of extraordinary talent. But history is filled with extraordinary leaders whose beginnings were less than ideal. By incorporating a morning routine, organizing tasks, focusing on our abilities and keeping a clear vision in mind of what we hope to accomplish, we can enjoy a life filled with productivity, achievement and success.

    "LabBody": "A few months ago, this joke video of someone playing a tortilla like a record went viral. The punch line being that the tortilla doesn't do anything but spin around, while the YouTuber plays the Mexican Hat Dance (Jarabe Tapatío) in the background. But now a very cool tech lover has actually made a working version of the tortilla record by etching the flat bread using lasers. And we are ridiculously impressed. As you can see in the video, the record tortilla created by YouTuber Rapture Records even plays the Mexican Hat Dance (although the sound quality isn't quite up to the standard of a regular record). Even better, you can make your own tortilla record following the instructions here. So how does this work? It all comes down to physics. A record player works by taking vibrations produced by the tiny grooves in a record and converting them into sound waves. This requires an incredibly hard needle, or stylus, to trace the grooves of a record as it spins around. As the needle moves up and down over the record's grooves, these vibrations travel along the arm holding the needle in place, and down to wires in a cartridge at the end of the arm. \"A coil in a magnetic field turns the vibrations into electrical signals, which are carried along wires to the amplifier. These boosted signals are finally turned back into sound through the speakers, producing the sounds and music recorded on vinyl records,\" LiveScience explains. So to get a tortilla to do the same thing, you simply need to work out the very specific pattern of grooves that will translate into the sound waves for the Mexican Hat Dance (or any other less culturally stereotypical song of your choosing). It's more complicated than it sounds, but the kind soul behind Raptor Records has shared the programs and details on Instructables that can help you convert a music file into cutting instructions. Once you have those instructions, you just need to plug them into a laser cutter, and get it etching onto your tortilla. Of course, that also requires a pretty lengthy trial and error process of finding the best tortilla consistency to write your song onto (hint: you don't want it too floury). And Raptor Records has done the leg-work on that for you too. The end result? Check out his Instructables page for the full, detailed instructions, and then watch the video above to enjoy the end result - a delicious food staple that produces beautiful music. If you still want some more inspiration, watch what happens when you try to play tree rings.",

If we count on our federal representatives we will all be dead before they can agree on policy. We have a law on immigration that is not being enforced or agreed upon. We have the 2nd Amendment that our president and his minions wish to overlook and we have the FBI and the CIA saying we have a growing Islamic terror group in this country that has orders to kill American's preferably by removing their heads from their necks. We have a growing illegal immigrant population; we have a growing underemployment and unemployment population. And we had a growing drug problem. Once Obama gets his way by restricting guns by law-abiding citizens we will have no way to defend ourselves from the haves and have-nots. We are rapidly becoming a third world country and our debt is growing exponentially. This is a very bad situation. The Pols will never know what hunger is and the average person cannot afford a bodyguard, and as I told one police officer that asked why I had a gun, and I said in order to protect myself, my family, and others from the worst of the worst. He said, \" that is our job\" and I said \"I am sure (you) would show up after the deed was done.\" The poor have not improved their lot in life in spite of the redistribution of wealth under Obama, and will continue under Hillary, and worse under Bernie Sanders.

    "LabBody": "The Missouri volleyball team seeks a year of improvement after last year’s 16-17 campaign, its first losing season since 2008. The Tigers graduated starting middle blocker Whitney Little, outside hitter/right-side hitter Emily Wilson and libero Sarah Meister. Setter Loxley Keala transferred. The production of Little, especially, will be difficult to replace. However, the combination of incoming talent and the development of some of the younger players who are now sophomores offers hope for a better season in 2015. “I’m really excited about our new people,” Coach Wayne Kreklow said. “The freshmen and the transfers are going to, I think, really give us a much-needed shot of athleticism and experience.” I chatted with Kreklow for a Thursday feature on sophomore setter Courtney Eckenrode, a transfer from San Diego State. Eckenrode will be eligible to compete in 2015. Kreklow plans to stick with the 6-2 system MU used last year, with Eckenrode and sophomore Ali Kreklow serving as setters. I also discussed some other areas of the roster with Kreklow. Our chat focused mostly on the younger players and newcomers. Don’t fear, veterans, such as two-time All-American outside hitter Carly Kan, are still fixtures. But at this point, you pretty much know what you’re going to get out of Kan: solid defense, a lot of swings and an offensive repertoire built on tip and roll shots and tooling blocks. Here’s some info on players who you might not know a ton about. •• The open starting spot at libero should result in one of the more interesting position battles in the preseason. Missouri has three main candidates: sophomore Alexa Armendariz, freshman Riley Sents and junior Alexa Ethridge, a transfer from Nebraska. “I think we’ve got three pretty solid defensive players that are all going to help us,” Kreklow said. “They all do something a little bit different, but they’re all pretty valuable. … I think that’s one area where we’ve helped ourselves a lot from a year ago.” Armendariz saw playing time in 89 of 128 sets last year as a defensive specialist and averaged 1.28 digs per set. “LA has got great ball control. She’s a little more on the quiet side, not as physical,” Kreklow said. Sents ranked in the top four in Iowa for digs in each of her four seasons as a starter for Class 2A Grundy Center. “Riley is a strong, physical kid who’s a real competitive, talkative, animated player, but she’s a rookie,” Krelow said. Ethridge was a setter in high school. She primarily served as a serving specialist in her two seasons as a defensive specialist with the Cornhuskers. “Alexis is kind of a combination of” Sents and Armendariz, Kreklow said. “Alexis has probably got a little bit of an advantage right now, just because she’s got another year of experience under her belt, but I expect all three of them are probably going to be able to help us.” •• MU is going to need better, more consistent, production from sophomores Kasey Reuter and/or Sydney Deeken. “Syd and Kasey will be huge for us,” Kreklow said. “We need those kids on the outside, and they both had good springs. Those guys, we need help from them.” Reuter and Deeken were top-60 recruits. They were multi-sport athletes in high school, and both were state high-jump champions. That athleticism appealed to Kreklow, but he said they needed some polishing skills-wise as freshmen. “We knew we were bringing in athletes that were green, multi-sport kids, particularly in those two,” Kreklow said. “What you’re doing there is you’re having to prolong the gratification a little bit, knowing that you could go out and get better-skilled kids, but those better-skilled kids are going to top out way before Syd and Kasey. They have the athletic ability. Their ceiling is much higher, but it’s also going to take a little bit longer to get there.” •• Missouri returns experience at middle blocker in the form of two-year starter Emily Thater and two-year reserve Julia Towler. Joining the mix is freshman Alyssa Munlyn, a Volleyball Magazine honorable mention All-American and the No. 36-ranked recruit by PrepVolleyball.com. “I think Alyssa Munlyn is going to be a favorite,” Kreklow said. “She’s just an athlete. She’s the one, we were down at the national tournament – their team was playing – and it makes you feel good when other coaches walk by and go, ‘We’re not playing you anymore.’ “She’s green. She’s really a better athlete, still, than a volleyball player. But she can do things athletically that most people can’t, just in terms of being able to get up and jump.” •• Kreklow plans to use sophomore Kira Larson, another transfer from Nebraska, as a right-side hitter after she played middle blocker for the Cornhuskers. She was ranked 23rd in her recruiting class by PrepVolleyball.com. Larson was a four-time high jump state champion in high school, and Kreklow expects right-side hitter will fit Larson’s strengths better than middle blocker. \"Kira is a natural one-foot jumper,\" Kreklow said. \"She was a high jumper. We’ve got three state high-jump champs now in Syd, Kasey Reuter and Kira Larson. So we’ve got people that jump really well off of one foot.” Larson “got in the middle” at Nebraska “and was often asked to go off of two feet. She’s just not the same person” going off two feet. “To me, I think when we looked at her, we thought, off of one foot, she’d be a great fit on the right side in the 6-2, because you can still go off of one foot.” •• Here’s a little more on Eckenrode, who transferred to MU in January after a year as San Diego State’s starting setter. “She’s connects with the middles pretty well,” Kreklow said. “She does work with the quick stuff really well. I think over the course of the” spring “semester, she got better and better just kind of understanding what we were kind of looking for in terms of the balls to the pins, to the outside hitters.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's new book, A Time For Truth, outsold nearly all of the 20 books on The New York Times' weekly bestseller list. The Texas senator's book ranks fourth on The Wall Street Journal hardcover list and fourth on the Publisher's Weekly hardcover list, Politico points out. And yet, Cruz's book is nowhere to be seen in the Times' ranking. Conservatives are irate. After all, Cruz's book sold 11,854 copies in its first week, Politico reports. In comparison, Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance — which snagged the number two spot on the Times' list — sold fewer than 10,000 copies. And yet, when The New York Times compiled its latest list, it informed HarperCollins that Cruz's book wasn't going to make the cut. HarperCollins demanded answers. The Times' response: \"We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" When asked to specify exactly what those standards were, the Times said that its decisions had to do with \"patterns of sales for every book.\" In this case, The Times says that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases.\" Becca Stanek",
    "LabBody": "Martin O'Malley wants the U.S. to accept as many as 13 times the number of Syrian refugees it currently plans to take in. The former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate called Friday for the U.S. to up its plans to accept between 5,000 to 8,000 immigrants to \"at least 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2016.\" O'Malley cited the photos of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who washed up dead on a Turkish beach after a failed attempt to sail from Turkey to Greece, for stirring his moral obligation to urge Americans to do more to help some four million Syrian refugees. \"Americans are a generous and compassionate people. But today our policies are falling short of those values,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"If Germany — a country with one-fourth our population — can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we — the nation of immigrants and refugees — can do more.\" As Europe faces an influx of migrants from Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East — a record 107,500 migrants entered the European Union in July alone — O'Malley contends that Americans are \"not immune from the injustices and tragedies that unfold outside our borders.\" So far, according to numbers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported by Newsweek, only 1,541 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S.",

    "LabBody": "A Midland woman was arrested on Wednesday after allegedly forging dozens of checks worth more than $62,000, according to court documents. Nona LaForge, 46, was charged with a third-degree felony of theft between $20,000 and $100,000 and a state jail felony of forgery of a financial instrument. She was being held on a $30,000 bond, according to the Midland County Sheriff’s Office. According to the affidavit, the alleged victim contacted the Midland Police Department in reference to a forgery on April 29. The alleged victim had found that a person who had access to certain personal documents, later identified as LaForge, had written checks for herself out of the alleged victim’s accounts. The alleged victim had found the discrepancies during a review of accounting books. The alleged victim believed that the amount of money taken was more than $51,000 and involved 79 checks between July 2014 and April of 2015. The detective assigned to the case found that 61 of the 79 checks were forged and that the other checks were legitimate payments. The fraudulent checks had the alleged victim’s forged signature on them and were allegedly made out to LaForge. The affidavit stated that four months of records were unaccounted for, but the detective wanted to contact LaForge before more forgery was committed. The detective and an officer made contact with LaForge on April 30, and she allegedly consented to travel with them to the Midland Police Department to give a statement. During the course of the interview LaForge allegedly asked if the case was about the forged checks, and then stated that “I (LaForge) forged his name.” LaForge allegedly told the detective that she was going to pay the money back, and that it had been used for necessities and for playing bingo. When confronted with the charges, LaForge was apologetic and worked with the detective to create an agreement for her to turn herself in on May 5. Upon further investigation of computer records the detective found that the total amount the LaForge had cashed in forged checks was more than $62,000. If convicted of the third-degree and state jail felonies, LaForge faces up to 12 years in prison.",

    "LabBody": "An enormous blue raindrop is filled with, well, a lot: A bearded wizard grimacing between a spider and its web, an upset cat-face and a finger with exposed bone to name a few. This piece, \"Heartsick,\" will be one of the murals featured by iMOCA. The Droops are a six-artist team comprised of Paul Pelsue, Ashley Windbigler, Brock Forrer, Ally Alsup, Adam Wollenberg and Emily Gable. They work together to create murals that feature each of their artistic talents. \"Long gone\" is a theme dear to their hearts and lives. They devised this theme while visiting Forrer and Alsup, Alaska. They journeyed to a cabin without electricity to brainstorm and visualize their show without any outside influences. The show was inspired in part by the realization that their childhood now exists only as images and memories. This exhibition is their foray into maturity and is the start of more focused style for The Droops. Long Gone will feature 40 of The Droops' pieces. Some of the artwork will be their distinct, collaborative murals and others are individual pieces that demonstrate each group member's style. Paula Katz, iMOCA's executive director, selected The Droops for this show, in part because of Emily Gable. Katz was in conversations with Gable about featuring her work at CityWay, but Gable suggested turning the show into a Droop-led experience. \"The Droops create work that is a strong balance between illustrative and linear drawings associated more with tattoos. The work is humorous while still being subtle,\" Katz said. They take familiar images like animals, boobs and ghosts and draw them in a cartoonish, garish manner. Bright colors complement their bold, graphic style. The Droops utilize humor as their inspiration and much of their work reflects their goofy demeanor. It's silliness juxtaposed with a hint of darkness. Though The Droops met at Herron School of Art, they didn't start producing team art until after they graduated. When they were released from school into the real world, they wanted to keep each other motivated. Their earliest pieces were bar drawings. While out drinking, they passed around a piece of paper and added doodle after doodle built off of the same image. These doodles eventually evolved into united group pieces that showcased each of their talents. Their group was cemented after Wollenberg and Forrer put on a well-received show at the Murphy. They enlisted Pelsue, Windbigler, Gable and Alsup to create the formal group ... formal might not be the right word. The Droops were already collaborating before their group name stuck. They were originally known as the Drops, but it reminded them too much of \"dropping the ball\" and they decided to alter it. Their name stems from them being \"super droopy;\" it epitomizes their light but sad style. When they heard the name out loud, it immediately became their theme and mantra. Each member has a different specialization. At Herron, three were printmakers, two were sculptors and one was a painting major. Since joining together their work has become paint heavy. Though their backgrounds are diverse, the art is cohesive. For instance, when one of them drew an interesting fire hydrant and the rest of the group wanted to draw their own hydrants. Someone's idea radiates outward until the group has filled an entire canvas with iterations. \"When we collaborate, it helps us out personally,\" said Windbigler. \"You see someone do something which influences you, you see someone do something cool and you want to make your own version.\" Gable agreed, \"I feel way more strong as a person and individual artist because I am a part of the group.\"",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "Isaiah Braziel spent Wednesday morning catching fish. The 11-year-old wasn’t outside by a lake or at the ocean on the warm summer day. And instead of using a rod, his tools included tweezers, plastic spoons and chopsticks as he grabbed goldfish crackers inside a classroom at Bethune-Cookman University. It was part of a science lesson about birds and why they need different types of beaks to find food. \"The spoons work the best,\" he determined, picking up about 10 crackers at once. Learning is put on hold for many children during the summer months. Books are abandoned. Math problems don't pop up during playtime. It can make for a pleasant escape for a while, but then August rolls around and some students have a difficult time catching up in their classes. Studies have shown that elementary students' performance falls by about a month during the summer, and the summer slide is far worse for lower-income students, according to the Rand Corp. That’s one reason Bethune-Cookman began offering a four-week summer academy learning program. In its second year, 75 children from four local elementary schools attend for free. They are fed breakfast and lunch and get an hour break for recreation time in the gymnasium. The majority of the 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. time slot is spent brushing up on math, reading and science. “During this time of year when kids are out of school, there’s a chance they are going to lose some of that momentum,\" said Al Bouie, assistant vice president of community affairs and K-16 initiatives. “If we can just close that gap where skills are lost, I believe we are improving a child’s potential to be successful academically.” Teachers at Turie T. Small, Palm Terrace, Westside and Champion elementary schools recommend students in grades three through five for the program. Parents are responsible for transportation to and from the college. It might sound like a tough sell for the children who are being told to go back into a classroom during the summer, but some who came last year were eager to return. “We always get to play,” said Fela Brown, a home schooled 9-year-old, adding that he still has time to ride his bicycle and play outside after he leaves the school at 2 p.m. “It’s not always work, work, work. It’s kind of fun, too.” B-CU President Edison Jackson has a college to run, but he believes part of his role as an educator extends to the neighboring schools as well. “For too long, there’s been a major separation between the university and K-12. You have to look at education on a continuum. And part of our mission is to help make a difference,” he said Wednesday as children inside the School of Education building peered into computer screens during a math class. “There is such a dire need out there. If I don’t do something and partner with the school system, then a lot of children will get lost.” Two years ago, Jackson launched B-CU's K-16 initiative and hired Bouie to lead the effort. The college has formed a partnership with the Volusia school district and programs have been implemented at Campbell Middle School, Turie T. Small and others. For the summer academy, certified educators are hired to teach various subjects. Current students help as well in a paid summer job that also offers an opportunity for hands-on experience. “The school district is very proud to be partnering with Bethune-Cookman University to enhance STEM-related instruction,” said area superintendent Vickie Presley. “The initiatives at the elementary, middle and high school level offer our students enrichment opportunities and expose them to many different careers\" in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. After wrapping up the summer program this week, Bouie will spend less time surrounded by children and more time in front of school principals. He has some catching up to do. Each of the elementary schools near Bethune-Cookman has new leaders this upcoming year, and Bouie has to make sure that nothing will change to the programs going forward. \"It’s just a matter of bringing the new administrators and teachers into what we are planning to do,\" he said. Jackson expects programs to only improve over the years, long after he's gone. \"My hope is that when I retire from here that these programs are so anchored in the life of the university that the next president will see the wisdom and continue this relationship,\" he said.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "Fred Manke has aspired to play baseball professionally since childhood, and the 19-year-old has already proven he’s willing to get out of his comfort zone to pursue his goals. This summer, that means playing for the Battle Creek (Mich.) Bombers of the Northwoods League. The former Lodi athlete, who finished his freshman season at the University of Minnesota in May, is a right-handed reliever for the Bombers, who will play the Madison Mallards today and Sunday at Warner Park. “Northwoods League is a grind — especially for pitchers. We play 70 games in almost as many days,” Manke said. “It’s the closest thing to minor league baseball you can get without being there.” While it would’ve been more convenient to play closer to home in a less competitive league, Manke jumped at the offer to play for Battle Creek. He’s faced a steep learning curve. In his only start for the Bombers, Manke allowed six runs and was pulled after getting only one out. Then there was the no-doubt-about-it home run he surrendered in another game. “I missed with a fastball against La Crosse and immediately knew it was long gone,” said Manke, describing a home run he gave up against the Loggers. “There are a lot of great hitters throughout the league.” In Manke’s first two appearances with Battle Creek, his ERA was 17.36. But since that rough start, Manke has settled in and become a dependable arm out of the bullpen with a 4.76 ERA. “The most difficult thing is finding a routine,” Manke said. “The league is a grind. We have to get our workouts in every day, and still be ready to pitch every day. It’s difficult and I’m still working to figure that out.” Manke has also had to get acclimated to the strenuous travel that comes with being a team from Michigan in the Northwoods League, which consists mostly of Minnesota and Wisconsin teams. “Travel is a lot harder than I expected. Eight-hour bus rides back to Wisconsin to play are really tough,” Manke said. For a variety of reasons, Manke admits he would have loved to spend his summer closer to his family and friends in Madison, but he insists Battle Creek offers a lot of benefits for him personally. “Not much to do, other than play baseball. Being home and around my family every day was really nice,” Manke said. “But playing ball has always been my main focus and Battle Creek makes sure that happens.” Manke said the Northwoods League experience can only help him when he returns to the Gophers. Battle Creek was never really on Manke’s radar before this summer, but in a way, he’s always appreciated the city with a population of 50,000 people. “I have always loved cereal,” Manke said after pointing out that the cereal company Kellogg’s headquarters are in Battle Creek. Cereal may be one of the perks of playing in Battle Creek, but the tougher competition will benefit Manke for what awaits him when he gets back to Minnesota. “We have all three weekend starting spots open,” Manke said of Minnesota’s rotation for next season. “Pitching here puts me in a good position to compete for one of those starting jobs.” Despite the original plan to redshirt for the Gophers, Manke started four games and worked in four others as a reliever. He posted a 1-1 record with a 5.96 ERA in 222/3 innings. Manke said he’s open to playing in the Northwoods League next season, but he’s keeping his options open. “The Cape (Cod League) is known to be the best league and NWL is a close second — depending upon who you ask,” Manke said. “I definitely would love to play on the Cape at some point before the end of college.”",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — The Confederate flag was lowered from the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse on Friday, ending its 54-year presence there and marking a stunning political reversal in a state where many thought the rebel banner would fly indefinitely. The turnabout seemed unthinkable before the June 17 massacre of nine black parishioners — including a state senator — at a Charleston church during a Bible study. Dylann Roof, a white man who was photographed with the Confederate flag, is charged in the shooting deaths, and authorities have called the killings a hate crime. The massacre reignited calls to remove Confederate flags and symbols across the South and around the nation. The crowd of thousands chanted \"USA\" and \"hey, hey, hey, goodbye\" as the flag was lowered by an honor guard of South Carolina troopers. Gov. Nikki Haley stood on the Statehouse steps and did not speak, though she nodded in the direction of the crowd after someone shouted: \"Thank you governor.\" Two troopers rolled the flag and tied it up with a string and handed it to a black trooper who brought it to the Statehouse steps and handed it to a state archivist. The governor clapped when it was handed to the archivist. A van was to take the flag to the nearby Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum. There, it eventually will be housed in a multimillion-dollar shrine lawmakers promised to build as part of a deal to get a bill passed removing the flag. The flag was raised over the South Carolina Capitol dome in 1961 to protest integration. It was moved in 2000 to the 30-foot flagpole in front of the Statehouse. Many thought it would stay there. Now, even that flagpole will be torn down, but no timetable is set on that. People who supported removing the flag chanted \"take it down\" before the ceremony and vastly outnumbered those who were upset about the move. \"It feels so good to be out here and be happy about it,\" said Ronald D. Barton, 52, a pastor who also was at the ceremony in 2000. Haley did not answer questions about the upcoming ceremony, but earlier Friday on NBC's \"Today\" show, she said: \"No one should ever drive by the Statehouse and feel pain. No one should ever drive by the Statehouse and feel like they don't belong.\" South Carolina's leaders first flew the battle flag over the Statehouse dome in 1961 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Civil War. It remained there to represent official opposition to the civil rights movement. Decades later, mass protests against the flag by those who said it was a symbol of racism and white supremacy led to a compromise in 2000 with lawmakers who insisted that it symbolized Southern heritage and states' rights. The two sides came to an agreement to move the flag from the dome to a 30-foot pole next to a Confederate monument in front of the Statehouse. The flag came down 23 days after the massacre of state Sen. Clementa Pinckney and eight others inside Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Haley signed the bill with 13 pens. Nine of them went to the families of the victims. Authorities say they believe the killings were racially motivated. By posing with the Confederate flag before the shootings, Roof, who has not yet entered a plea to nine counts of murder, convinced some that the flag's reputation for white supremacy and racial oppression had trumped its symbolism of Southern heritage and ancestral pride. On Friday, artist Ernest Lee came to the Statehouse with a framed portrait of all nine victims. He said he's been invited to the Charleston church on Sunday to present his artwork. He said he wished more people would turn to art for inspiration. \"If they did, there wouldn't be so much hate and violence,\" he said.",

    "LabBody": "BARTOW | A Bartow group is launching a grassroots effort to raise $25,000 for two monuments, one honoring the community's Purple Heart recipients and a second for those held prisoners of war or missing in action. Bartow resident Myra Glisson said he's thinks it's high time Bartow joined the ranks of other communities, like Lakeland and Auburndale, that have recognized these veterans. \"We are the county seat,\" she said, \"and we should be the ones leading the way.\" The city has agreed to allow the monuments to be erected in Civic Plaza, located along Davidson Street at Central Avenue downtown, she said, so all that remains is funding. \"We've collected a few hundred dollars so far, but we need half the money to order the monuments,\" Glisson said. Each monument will be built of granite, measuring about 5 feet high, 5 feet wide and about 18 inches deep, based on tentative plans, she said. \"We want the wording on the monuments to be at eye level, so it's easy to read,\" she said. Mike Mason, an Army veteran and Polk County's supervisor of veteran services, said he'd like to see monuments like this in every city. \"The Purple Heart is a special medal for those wounded in combat,\" he said, \"and veterans that receive that medal are very proud of it. They are revered, and they should be honored.\" Mason is among those, having received a Purple Heart for injuries he received in fighting along the Cambodian border in 1971. He was 20. \"To me, Bartow is the center of the county and this is the heartland of Florida,\" he said. \"These monuments should be here.\" Mason, who is vice commander for the Military Order of the Purple Heart in Florida, said the Lakeland-based Polk County chapter totals about 150 members, but not all of those still live in the county. \"There's no way of knowing how many recipients there might be in Bartow,\" he said. \"No one tracks that, but I'm sure there are many.\" Larry MacBlane, commander of the American Legion Post 3 in Bartow, said the group supports the monuments honoring Purple Heart recipients and those held prisoner of war or who went missing, and will be donating to the effort. \"We are all veterans, and if somebody is deserving, it's nice to have them recognized so people don't forget about them,\" he said. \"The Purple Heart is a medal that I never wanted because it meant you were hurt or didn't make it.\" The medal is given to those whose wounds require medical care, he said, and to the families of those who die in the line of duty. Glisson said the committee proposed Civic Plaza because of serenity and proximity to the county's History Center, which is housed in the historic courthouse across the street. The park is landscaped and lighted, she said, and already has concrete pads where the monuments can be placed. She said Summerlin Academy has stepped up to maintain the monuments once they've been installed. Glisson said she's hoping to finalize design plans and order the monuments by the end of the year. \"They need six months lead time to build the monuments,\" she said, \"and we'd like to have something put up for a Memorial Day unveiling. If that can't be done, there are other opportunities, like the Fourth of July or Veterans Day.\" The Bartow Area Chamber Foundation, an affiliate of the Greater Bartow Chamber of Commerce, is working with the committee to collect donations and market the fund-raising effort. \"It's a deserving project,\" said Jeff Clark, the chamber's executive director. \"It does fit here, with us being the historical center of the county, and that's certainly a part of our history. And it's appropriate for us to honor these recipients and veterans.\" [ Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070.

    "DiffbotBody": "Hype can be a dangerous thing in fantasy football. Sure, it's great to know who this year's rising stars and hot sleepers are. The problem begins when everyone starts reading the same reports. Writing their own takes based on those reports. Targeting the same players based on what they've read and/or written. That, in turn, drives up the asking price of those sleepers and value plays. A running back who was being drafted close to his fantasy floor rises nearer to his ceiling. That late-round lottery ticket wideout goes from $1 scratcher to one of those big, shiny ones that cost 20 bucks. In 2014, everyone and their mother (hi Mom!) were convinced that San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green was going to take the reins from Antonio Gates. Green's Average Draft Position rose steadily throughout the summer, to the point he was drafted ahead of the future Hall of Famer. Well, Gates caught 12 touchdowns and finished as a top-five tight end in most scoring systems. Green caught 19 passes all season long. With that cautionary tale in mind, here are a handful of players for whom hype levels are redlining in 2015. Begin Slideshow » Average Draft Position: QB4 (37th overall) I will be the first person to admit that I'm an unabashed fan of Seattle Seahawks quarterback . My admiration for him as a player borders on man-crush levels. And Wilson is coming off a phenomenal season, both from an NFL and fantasy football perspective. Wilson set career highs in passing yards (3,475), rushing yards (849) and rushing touchdowns (six) en route to leading the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Wilson also posted the best fantasy finish of his three-year career, finishing fifth at his position in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. With Wilson headed into the final year of his rookie deal, there has been speculation that Wilson could be set to become the highest-paid player in NFL history. Doug Farrar of Sports Illustrated might not be willing to go quite that far, but you'll get no argument from him that Wilson's worth a whole lotta money: Is Russell Wilson a franchise quarterback? I would posit that the answer lies somewhere between “Yes” and “Well, duh... of course he is.” He's accomplished things no other quarterback has accomplished through his first three seasons, and while he's had a lot of help, the Seahawks weren't going to win all those games and reach the Super Bowl twice with Tarvaris Jackson, Charlie Whitehurst or Matt Flynn under center. Wilson's asking price has gone way up in fantasy drafts as well. A player who was barely being drafted as a weekly starter a year ago is now going ahead of Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints. And that's no bueno. As things stand right now, fantasy owners are counting on Wilson bettering last year's career stats just to justify his asking price. Not exceed, mind you—justify. And this is a quarterback for the team that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL in 2014. Yes, much of Wilson's fantasy production is tied to his ability to hurt teams with his legs. But consider this—assuming that the Seahawks and Wilson do agree to an extension, do you think the team that just invested well over $100 million in Wilson is going to want him to carry the ball 118 times in 2015? Wilson's a great young player and a fine fantasy option. But with a top-five sticker price? Pass. Average Draft Position: RB20 (44th overall) You aren't going to get any argument that Todd Gurley is a talented, young running back. You won't get much that he's the best rookie ball-carrier to come down the pipe in some time. Mike Mayock of the NFL Network lauded the Rams' selection of Gurley with the No. 10 overall pick, comparing the 6'1\", 221-pounder to Marshawn Lynch of the Seattle Seahawks: I like the Marshawn Lynch comparison. St. Louis wants to win games the same way that Seattle and San Francisco do in the same division, that is by running the football and playing great defense and special teams. Gurley has Olympic-type speed. I love this pick for St. Louis, which already has a great defense and Gurley will help out Nick Foles. It would appear that fantasy owners agree. Last year, Bishop Sankey of the Tennessee Titans was chosen as the first rookie running back in fantasy drafts, with an average draft position at My Fantasy League of RB25. Gurley is coming off the board a full five slots higher, ahead of veterans like Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina Panthers and Joique Bell of the Detroit Lions. There's just one problem—one huge, glaring problem. Gurley tore his ACL last November while at Georgia. Yes, the recovery time for such an injury isn't what it used to be. And reports from Rams' camp have been almost universally positive. However, even if Gurley is ready to rock for Week 1, as Thomas Emerick of Sporting News points out, we're likely to see a lot of second-year pro Tre Mason, at least early in the season: Fisher's approach to managing Gurley's workload will set the ceiling for September and October, where we'll probably see a snap limit and heavy dose of Mason. Gurley owners will hope this step takes place in August. St. Louis also drafted four desperately needed offensive linemen, and this run offense will depend on a young line jelling together and finding starters by fire. With Mason in the fold, there's no reason for the Rams to rush Gurley. And yet he's being drafted like a Week 1 bell cow. Those who pull that trigger better hope it turns out better than Sankey in 2014. Average Draft Position: WR16 (41st overall) There may not be a more hyped player in all of fantasy football than New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Keith Lipscomb of ESPN was one of any number of pundits who have gushed about Cooks' potential as the new No. 1 receiver in the Big Easy: I think the Saints are going to turn up the volume in Cooks' game in his sophomore season. In his first five games, he averaged just 4.1 yards at the catch (how far downfield he caught the ball), but in his final five games before his injury, that number was 12.0. You know the Saints still want to throw the football but don't have their top-two pass-catchers from last season. Cooks is a dynamic talent, and this season he'll get every opportunity to show the masses, including more chances to make plays down the field. It isn't just fantasy types, either. Chris Wesseling of NFL.com also wrote that Cooks could be on the verge of a breakout in his second NFL season: Now that Jimmy Graham and Kenny Stills have been shipped off to Seattle and Miami, respectively, there could be as many as 175-200 targets up for grabs in the Saints' aerial attack. With only a declining Marques Colston ahead of him in the pecking order, Cooks is sure to be a featured player after dominating offseason practices. And it's possible that breakout could happen. Cooks showed himself to be dangerous in the open field last year before a broken thumb ended his season, and with both Stills and especially Graham gone, someone is going to have to pick up the slack. The problem is that with all the buzz surrounding Cooks, his ADP has been steadily climbing. A player with one season of 550 receiving yards is being taken as a high-end fantasy WR2. And for Lipscomb's colleague Field Yates, that cost is just too high: There's a lot to like about Brandin Cooks' game, as he's shifty, elusive and a menace to tackle in open space. But he plays a position -- slot receiver -- that isn't often conducive to finding the end zone frequently. He's slotted as our 16th wide receiver, but I simply think the lack of touchdowns will be an issue from a fantasy perspective. The issue isn't even Cooks per se. It's the hype that's sucked all the value from a player now being drafted far closer to his fantasy ceiling than the floor. Average Draft Position: TE6 (75th overall) OK, so \"hype\" may not exactly be the best word to describe the buzz surrounding Julius Thomas, especially in fantasy circles. In fact, he needs a hug. Evan Silva's comments about Thomas over at Yahoo Sports more-or-less sum up the fantasy community's feelings about Thomas moving to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency this year: Julius Thomas was easily the biggest fantasy \"loser\" of this year's free agency period, going from a Broncos offense that ranked first and second in the NFL in scoring in 2013 and 2014, to a Jags team that finished 32nd and 32nd in those seasons. While Thomas may prove a useful real-life pickup for Jacksonville, the bottom could fall out on his fantasy production. I told you he needed a hug. Although that $9 million a season the Jaguars forked over probably makes the 27-year-old feel a little bit better. If I need to explain to you why going from the fantasy penthouse that is Peyton Manning in Denver to the fantasy outhouse that is Jacksonville and Blake Bortles, then might I recommend fantasy bowling? I hear fantasy cricket is—whatever happens during a cricket jiminy or whatever it's called. And yet Thomas is still being selected sixth at the tight end spot on average. That's ahead of Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles, who could be set for a big uptick in targets this year. Ahead of Jordan Cameron of the Miami Dolphins, who has the added advantage of an honest-to-goodness NFL quarterback throwing him passes in Ryan Tannehill. And far ahead of veteran Owen Daniels, who replaced Thomas in Denver. Have these people seen Bortles and the Jaguars play? Average Draft Position: D/ST1 (68th overall) From an NFL perspective, there's no arguing that the Seattle Seahawks have one of the NFL's very best defenses. In 2014, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. The year before, the Seahawks led the NFL in total defense. Scoring defense? First in 2014. First in 2013. Two years ago, all was well. The Seahawks also ranked fourth in NFL.com default fantasy scoring. Not great, but nothing to cry about. Last year? Tears galore. The Seahawks free-fell to 23rd. The change was brought about by big plays—or more appropriately, the lack of them. The Seahawks dropped from eighth in the NFL in sacks two seasons ago to 20th in 2014. In 2013, the Seahawks ranked fourth in takeaways. Last year, that number plummeted to 21st. Yes, those numbers could rebound in 2015. Or not. It's not as if the Seahawks made big upgrades to the pass rush in the offseason, and turnovers are a fluky stat. Spending a sixth-round pick (in a 12-team fantasy football league) on any team defense isn't advisable. Spending one on a fantasy defense (that finished outside the top 20 a year ago) because it's a great NFL defense is even worse. It's falling for the hype.

    "LabBody": "TRAVERSE CITY — Smoked pork seasoned with a homemade dry rub, braised in cherry barbecue sauce, topped with coleslaw and served on a griddled butter bun. Toasted goat cheese rolled in sweet and spicy nut mix, served atop spring mix and romaine lettuce with oven-roasted beets and drizzled with homemade cherry honey mustard vinaigrette. They’re just a few of the more than 50 cherry items on the menu at Cherry Republic’s new Traverse City Grand Cafe. But don’t be fooled by the name. “It’s not deli food, it’s not simple café food,” said café manager Renee Builes. “It’s Traverse City foodie food.” That means everything is done with “some finesse and style,” from the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Warm Goat Cheese Salad to the kids’ PB, B \u0026 J made with Cherry Republic’s own White Chocolate Cherry Peanut Butter and Cherry Jelly, plus bananas. “It’s not just adding dried cherries to everything,” Builes said. “For example, the chicken is marinated in cherry wine before it’s grilled. Even our pizza sauce is infused in cherries. \"My husband is from Colombia so he’s particular about Latin food. He thinks our Cuban Sandwich (with thinly sliced homemade pickles and Cherry Republic Cherry Mustard on buttered Cuban bread) is the best he’s ever had,\" she said. The Grand Café opened in May inside Cherry Republic’s remodeled 6,500-square-foot retail store on Front Street and is being discovered as fast as summer visitors flock to town. \"As soon as schools let out, we got busy,\" said Builes, a Leelanau County native and former chef. “When we send people out with samples before lunch, we have a line. We have people here for lunch who are planning what they’re going to have here for dinner.” The café seats 65 and is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. It offers lunch, dinner and \"morning eats\" including bakery items, a quiche of the day, Greek yogurt parfait with Cherry Republic’s Cherry Crunch Maple Granola and toasted bagels topped with cherry cream cheese. Offering an all-cherry menu isn’t as hard as it sounds, said Cherry Republic Corporate Chef Tony Finnestad, a classically trained Culinary Institute of America chef who devised the dishes with help from cafe chef Chris Henry. “When you think of all the products we have as resources, it’s not that difficult,” he said, pointing to the store’s signature cherry jams, honeys, mustards, dressings, sauces and salsas, along with its cherry tortilla chips, nut mixes, cherry summer sausage and other products. “You have to be creative, but it’s a fun way to think outside of the box.” He said the Traverse City café has about half as many seats as Cherry Republic's Glen Arbor café, which offers outdoor patio seating. But its kitchen and menu are larger. And Traverse City café offers pizzas the Glen Arbor café doesn’t, although the Traverse City location doesn’t serve the popular Cherry Bacon Marmalade Burger. Five pizza varieties range from a Traditional Pie starring homemade cherry-roasted San Marzano tomato sauce, provolone and mozzarella cheese, and basil, to Bacon \u0026 Blue Fig Jam Pie featuring homemade blue cheese and cream sauce, cheese, cherrywood-smoked bacon, basil and a few dollops of Cherry Republic Cherry Fig Jam. Even the Healthy Schmealthy Veggie Pie features a touch of cherry. “We deglaze the pan with Cherry White Wine,” Finnestad said. The goal is to balance sweet and savory, cherry and non-cherry flavors in all of the cafe's dishes, he said. “They’re made in a thoughtful, purposeful way. You get all these flavors but you don’t get big bites of cherry,” he added. The café offers its menu to go, including sides like Black Bean \u0026 Corn Salad, Cherry Coleslaw and Cherry Corn Muffin (served with Cherry Republic’s Cherry Crème Honey butter). Diners can wash down or top off their meal with homemade cherry ice creams, sodas, coffee, teas and lemonade. Builes said she has lots of ideas for the future, including box lunches visitors can take to the park or the beach. “We explored that option a little in Glen Arbor,” Finnestad said. “I wanted to do picnic packs or beach baskets. It may be a bottle of wine, our feta dip and a couple of sandwiches or salads, or four sodas and stuff for kids or a couple cookies.” Call 932-9205 for take-out orders or for more information. Cherry Republic Bacon \u0026 Blue Fig Jam Pie. Yield: 1 Pie. 1 pizza dough (recipe below) 4-6 oz. Blue Cream Cheese Sauce (recipe below) 3 oz. mozzarella cheese, shredded. 3 oz. provolone cheese, shredded. 3 stripes cherrywood-smoked bacon, diced. 6-8 large leaves basil. 3 T. Cherry Republic Cherry Fig Jam. Preheat oven to 500° F. After stretching your dough to desired size, place it on a pizza screen or perforated pizza pan. Top with Blue Cream Cheese Sauce (desired sauce amount is up to you), mozzarella, provolone and bacon, and pop it into the oven for 8-12 minutes, depending on desired doneness. After pulling the pizza from the oven, chiffonade your fresh basil and spread evenly. Finish the pizza by dolloping Cherry Fig Jam across it. Blue Cheese Cream Sauce. This fantastically creamy blue cheese sauce is quite versatile. In the past Cherry Republic also used it on sandwiches, as a dip for wings and tossed with pasta. Yield: 2 ½ qt. 1 T. olive oil. 1 c. red onion, rough chopped. 6 cloves garlic, rough chopped. 1/2 c. Cherry Republic Cherry White Wine. 2 qt. heavy cream. 2 c. blue cheese crumbles. 1 T. plus 1 t. Kosher salt. Heat sauté pan over low heat. Add olive oil. Add onion and garlic and sauté, stirring often, until translucent. Remove pan from heat and deglaze with Cherry White Wine. Cook over medium heat until au sec (nearly dry), until almost all of the wine has cooked off. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cream. Bring to a simmer, turn off heat and remove pan from heat. Strain the cream through a china cap into another sauté pan. Add the pan to the burner and bring to a simmer over low heat. Slowly whisk in blue cheese until all has melted or been absorbed into the sauce. Stir in salt. Transfer to appropriate container, cover, label and date. Homemade Pizza Dough. Yield: 4 pizzas, depending on how thin you want them. 3 ¾ c. all-purpose flour (plus a bit more for shaping) 1/4 t. yeast. 1 ½ c. water, room temperature. 2 t. salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt and yeast. Slowly drizzle water in and work with your hands or a rubber spatula to fully incorporate and mix thoroughly until it forms a rough ball. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow to it rise at room temperature for 18-24 hours. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into 4 equal portions. At this point you can either shape them by hand, or roll them out with a rolling pin. To shape by hand, simply stretch the dough slowly on a floured work surface until you’ve reached the desired shape and size. Note: The shaping process is critical to your desired finished product. Using a rolling pin will force out all of the gas that has developed in the fermented dough, resulting in a completely flat, thin crust. Shaping by hand yields an airy, slightly chewy but crisp crust with great texture.",

    "LabBody": "GARY | Headquartered in Chicago, The Boeing Company’s influence and presence stretches from the Gary/Chicago International Airport, around the globe, and even into outer space. And even though Boeing is the world’s largest aerospace enterprise, the company continues to make an impact locally and regionally in Northwest Indiana. Courtney A. Thompson, Boeing’s director of government operations for the Great Lakes Region based in Chicago, delivered that message at Wednesday’s Gary Chamber of Commerce annual membership meeting at Majestic Star Hotel. Between 75 and 80 Boeing employees are based at the Gary/Chicago International Airport, which houses the company's corporate jet fleet. “I’ve had the great good fortune to work with the City of Gary and the Gary airport,\" Thompson said. \"We have a lovely hangar there. Our employees there are mainly pilots and others who take care of the hangar. The pilots shuttle our top leadership around the world.” During the meeting, she also recognized the Gary Jet Center at the Gary/Chicago International Airport for being named a Boeing Supplier of the Year. Boeing is also one of the sponsors of the 2015 Gary Air Show that takes off July 11 and 12, Thompson said. Other Northwest Indiana connections include the celebration of the company’s 100th anniversary in 2016. Lakeshore Public Media, for example, will air movies and newsreel footage celebrating mankind’s journey into the skies as well as Boeing’s history. Thompson also invited those in attendance to visit the History of Flight exhibit that is currently touring around the world and will be at Chicago’s Museum of Science \u0026 Industry in the fall of 2016. In addition to mentoring future generations of workers, Boeing also engages in corporate citizenship “to create positive change in our communities,” Thompson said. “Last year, Boeing donated $188 million with 52 percent given to education,\" she said. \"We have an employees’ community fund and the employees decide where their donations will go.” She added that Boeing partners with community organizations in such areas as education, the environment and veterans’ programs. Boeing employs more than 160,000 people around the world, has an average annual income of $90.8 billion and is the leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems, Thompson said. As a top U.S. exporter, Boeing’s sells 70 percent of its airplanes outside the U.S. “Our future and our markets exist outside the U.S.,” she said. “We have 21,000 suppliers around the world...Three quarters of the world’s flights are global. Global customers are incredibly important to us.” That, Thompson said, is why the U.S. Congress needs to reauthorize the Export/Import Bank by June 30. “The Export/Import Bank provides financing solutions for our customers. It doesn’t compete with banks in this country,” she said. “There are a number of our customers who use the Export/Import Bank in Northwest Indiana. This is not about Boeing. It’s about all our employees and suppliers.”",

    "LabBody": "Without fanfare, the landmark neon Fagiani’s bar sign on Main Street was taken down early Wednesday morning and hauled off for repair and storage. The marker, which dated from the 1940s, had evoked memories of old Napa, before the tourists and chi-chi restaurants, and had marked the spot of one of the city’s most notorious murders. For almost 40 years, following the 1974 homicide, the sign had hung unlit over Main Street, marking an empty building caught in a ghostly time warp while downtown changed all around it. It glowed again in 2012 when AvroKO, a New York-based restaurant firm, reopened the building with an upscale eatery/bar that paid homage to the building’s history: The Thomas and Fagiani’s Bar. Now AvroKO is changing concepts for the restaurant which will briefly close at the end of July, then reopen in early August as Ninebark, the company announced. The Fagiani name is being dropped from the revamped business, thus the decision to strip the sign from the building, said Steve Hasty, the building owner who leases to AvroKO. “It’s a rebranding,” said Hasty. “A new concept for a new chef.” “I’m going to miss that sign front,” Hasty admitted. “It’s a sad feeling.” The sign had gone dark in the mid-1970s, when one of the building’s owners, Anita Andrews, was murdered inside the bar. A year before the reopening in 2012 as The Thomas, there had been an improbable break in the nearly 40-year-old homicide case. A Colorado man, 74-year-old Roy Melanson, was sentenced to life in prison in Napa Superior Court for the Andrews murder. Napa Police had tied Melanson to the 1970s murder using DNA from a cigarette butt left at the crime scene. Only later did DNA technology allow police to analyze the butt for Melanson’s saliva. Hasty said the Fagiani’s sign had been battered several times by trucks over the past three years. The most recent incident occurred during last weekend’s Fourth of July festivities in downtown when it was damaged again to the tune of about $6,000, he said. “The sign has been an expensive proposition,” said Hasty, who noted that AvroKO’s insurance will be paying for the latest repair, before handing the sign back to him. Why this streak of damaging incidents to a sign that had stood unscathed over the Main Street sidewalk for decades? Hasty blames the hump in the middle of Main Street — the result, he thinks, of many coats of asphalt — which causes trucks that park in front of the bar to tilt a foot and a half toward the sign. Hasty said he already had a treasure trove of memorabilia from the old Fagiani’s bar. With the transformation of The Thomas and Fagiani’s Bar into Ninebark, he will get more. He will reclaim bar stools, deer heads and other Fagiani paraphernalia that AvroKO had used to enhance the ambiance of their operation. AvroKO promises an “airy, garden-driven design over Ninebark’s three floors … (including ) a rooftop garden style dining and bar experience with central lounge gliders and banquettes covered in vintage plaids.” The partners at AvroKO announced they had formed a new partnership with lauded chef Matthew Lightner, formerly of the two Michelin-starred Atera in New York City. Lightner is heading up all of AvroKO’s West Coast culinary operations under the banner AvroKO Hospitality Group West, with Ninebark being their first new venture together. The new collaboration is named for a popular California garden plant, commonly called Pacific ninebark. The name comes from the appearance of the bark, which is flaky and peels away in many layers. Under Lightner’s direction, the new restaurant, bar and rooftop lounge will feature California market-driven cuisine utilizing innovative preparation techniques – smoking with local hardwood and shrubs, charcoal grilling and marinating in herbal, fruit and floral broths. The new partnership also has plans to open an eatery in Calistoga next year. The stone building at 813 Main St. was built in 1909, with The Thomas restaurant as its first ground-floor tenant. A boarding house operated above. In 1945, Nick Fagiani bought the property and opened the bar that bears his name. His daughter, Anita Andrews and Muriel Fagiani, were operating it at the time of the 1974 murder. Hasty said he doesn’t know what he will do with his collection of Fagiani’s paraphernalia. It doesn’t seem right to keep it all for himself, away from the public’s view, he said. “If somebody cared about the history of it, I’d probably move some (objects) along,” he said. “If they cared about them for the right reason.” Reporter L.

    "LabBody": "WASHINGTON — We need a pick me up. Amid the vandalizing of Palmyra, the imminent extinction of the northern white rhino, the disarray threatening Europe’s most ambitious attempt ever at peaceful unification — amid plague and pestilence and, by God, in the middle of Shark Week — where can humanity turn for uplift? Meet New Horizons, arriving at Pluto on July 14. Small and light, the fastest spacecraft ever launched, it left Earth with such velocity that it shot past our moon in nine hours. A speeding bullet the size of a Steinway, it has flown 9 1/2 years to the outer edges of the solar system. To Pluto, the now-demoted “dwarf planet” that lives beyond the Original Eight in the far distant “third zone” of the solar system — the Kuiper Belt, an unimaginably huge ring of rocks and ice and sundry debris where the dwarf is king. After 3 billion miles, New Horizons will on Tuesday shoot right through Pluto’s mini-planetary system of five moons, the magnificently named Charon, Styx, Nix, Hydra and Kerberos. Why through? Because, while the other planets lie on roughly the same plane, Pluto and its moon system stick up at an angle to that plane like a giant archery target. New Horizons gets one pass, going straight by the bull’s-eye. No orbiting around, no lingering for months or even years to photograph and study. No mulligans. And no navigating. Can’t do that when it takes 4 1/2 hours for a message from Earth to arrive. This is a preprogrammed, single-take, nine-day deal. For what? First, for the science, the coming avalanche of new knowledge. Remember: We didn’t even know there was a Pluto until 85 years ago when astronomer Clyde Tombaugh found a strange tiny dot moving across the star field. Today, we still know practically nothing. In fact, two of the five moons were not discovered until after New Horizons was launched. And yet next week we will see an entirely new world come to life. “We’re not planning to rewrite any textbooks,” said principal investigator Alan Stern in a splendid New York Times documentary on the mission. “We’re planning to write them from scratch.” Then there’s the romance. The Pluto fly-by caps a half-century of solar system exploration that has yielded staggering new wonders. Such as Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, with its vast subterranean ocean under a crust of surface ice, the most inviting potential habitat for extraterrestrial life that human beings will ever reach. Yes, ever. Promising exoplanets — the ones circling distant stars that we deduce might offer a Goldilocks zone suitable for water-based life — are being discovered by the week. But they are unreachable. The journey to even the nearest would, at New Horizons speed, take 280,000 years. Even mere communication would be absurdly difficult. A single exchange of greetings — “Hi there,” followed by “Back at you, brother” — would take a generation. It’s the galactic version of the old Trappist monastery joke where every seven years one monk at one meal is allowed one remark. A young novice arrives and after seven years a monk stands up at dinner and says: “The soup is cold.” Seven years of silence. Then another monk stands and says: “The bread is stale.” Seven years later, the now-aging novice rises and says: “If you don’t stop this bickering, I’m outta here.” Which is what a conversation with Klingons would be like, except with longer intervals. Which is why we prefer to scour our own solar system. And for more than just the science, more than just the romance. Here we are, upright bipeds with opposable thumbs, barely down from the trees, until yesterday unable to fly, to communicate at a distance, to reproduce a sound or motion or even an image — and even today barely able to manage the elementary decencies of civilization — taking close-up pictures and chemical readings of a mysterious world 9 1/2 years away. One final touch. Every ounce of superfluous weight has been stripped from New Horizons to give it more speed and pack more instruments. Yet there was one concession to poetry. New Horizons is carrying some of Clyde Tombaugh’s ashes. After all, he found the dot. Not only will he fly by his netherworldly discovery, notes Carter Emmart of the American Museum of Natural History, he will become the first human being to have his remains carried beyond the solar system. For the wretched race of beings we surely are, we do, on occasion, manage to soar. Krauthammer writes for The Washington Post; letters@charleskrauthammer.com.",

    "LabBody": "Past the mountains of buried trash at Flagstaff’s Cinder Lake Landfill, 25-foot-high fences stand guard to catch flyaway trash picked up by northern Arizona’s whipping winds. Everything from dog food bags to plastic containers cling to the base of the fences’ nets, but by far the most prevalent items are plastic bags. The city of Flagstaff spent almost $67,000 last year removing windblown trash from the area around the landfill, and project manager Matt Morales estimated that up to 80 percent of the items lofted beyond the landfill’s fences are plastic bags. The possibility of eliminating, or at least greatly reducing, the single-use bags that get caught in trees, coalesce in waterways and blow across streets in and around Flagstaff is motivating a growing coalition of groups hoping to convince the city’s leaders to enact a ban or a fee on them. After sitting on the back burner for almost eight years, the issue of regulating the disposable bags given out at the cash register of Flagstaff’s retail stores will move to the forefront next month. City Council is scheduled to consider plastic bags at a Jan. 13 work session. The city’s sustainability department and its sustainability commission have spent months studying the issue, collecting data and creating a draft ordinance while local community groups have started to mobilize education and outreach efforts in support of such action. Across the country, more than 170 cities or counties having banned or placed fees on one-time-use plastic and even paper bags. Now, it will be Flagstaff’s turn to decide if it will join them. No appetite. City leaders first started tossing around the idea of somehow regulating one-time-use bags in 2007, said Nicole Woodman, the city’s sustainability manager. But there wasn’t the appetite for an ordinance, so the city instead decided to focus on outreach and education. Staffers gave out reusable bags, designed educational games about recycling and waste and helped set up plastic bag recycling drop offs at local grocery stores. The city also completed surveys, one that showed that almost 90 percent of Flagstaff residents thought litter was a problem in the city and associated plastic bags with that issue. Another in 2013 showed 59 percent of residents supported banning plastic bags at stores in Flagstaff and 44 percent supported imposing a per-bag fee. A group of fifth-graders even did research on the issue and calculated that stores around Flagstaff give out more than 9.5 million point-of-sale bags each year. It was after their presentation to city council in May 2012 that council asked for a recommendation on how to address plastic bags in the community, Woodman said. Since then, the city’s sustainability commission has researched disposable bag ordinances in places like Boulder, Colo., whose 10-cent fee on paper and plastic bags resulted in a 68 percent reduction in the use of single-use bags. Eugene, Ore., found that after implementing a plastic bag ban and a 5-cent paper bag fee, 60 percent of retailers said more people were bringing their own bags and Seattle, which implemented the same ban and fee combination, reported that almost half of retailers saw a decrease in the use of single-use bags. After looking at the data, the commission drafted an ordinance that would ban plastic bags given out by retailers at the register, or point-of-sale. Woodman’s recommendation is to place a fee on both paper and plastic bags and use the revenue to provide free reusable bags to the community. The proposed ordinances and other data will be a starting point, but “we want the council to have a philosophical conversation about plastic bags,” Woodman said. Environment and economics. While the city commission’s proposed ordinance focuses on the environmental impacts of plastic bags, this is an issue where environment and economics align, said Moran Henn, programs and development director with Friends of Flagstaff's Future, which supports either a ban or a fee on the disposable bags. Stores save money because they don’t have to purchase as many bags for customers. The Flagstaff Farmers Market on the east side of town stopped offering plastic bags at the cash register this fall. Owner George Yoskovich estimated the move will save the store $12,000 a year in bag costs in the coming year, allowing him to lower prices. He offers to put bigger customer orders in reused cardboard boxes, reducing the number of times he needs to have them hauled away from the store. Inside Norton Environmental’s Materials Recovery Facility on Butler Avenue, which sorts and bales the city’s recycling, plastic bags act like gum in the belts and rollers that carry materials through the building. The facility has to stop its machines several times a day to clean out plastic, which costs the company $200 or more per day in lost work time, said Ray Sellards, the general manager. At the Cinder Lake Landfill, plastic bags tend to fly the farthest beyond the outer fencing. Morales said that if a ban or a fee regulation could reduce the amount of plastic bags delivered there, it would significantly reduce the area landfill employees would have to cover in cleanup efforts. From an environmental standpoint, it’s hard to argue with the litter plastic bags create, Woodman said. Very few are effectively reused, recycled or properly disposed of and they create “unsightly litter on streets, sidewalks and waterways,” according to her documents on the issue. They are a constant sight during waterway cleanups organized by Friends of Flagstaff’s Future, Henn said. As the bags break down they become microlitter that’s almost impossible to collect. Bags and people. Some have brought up the argument that a ban could have a disproportional impact on low or fixed income populations, but Henn pointed out that reusable bags are prolific and cost just a few cents each at thrift stores. If a ban or a fee were to pass, Henn said her organization would ramp up its efforts to make and distribute reusable bags. The city is also working on creating bag banks at places like the public library where people can get reusable bags for free, Woodman said. In the case of a fee on paper or plastic bags, the city would have a revenue stream that it could put to a variety of uses. The advantage of considering bag regulations now is that Flagstaff has dozens of examples to study, Henn said. “We are looking at cultural shifts,” she said of the issue. “We have to start shifting away from the idea of disposables. That something can just be used once and thrown away, from coffee cups to take out containers, and bags are a good first start for Flagstaff.” Emery Cowan can be reached at (928) 556-2250 or ecowan@azdailysun.com.",

    "LabBody": "Seven years ago, after Hurricane Katrina wiped out entire neighborhoods in the Mississippi Delta, Congress had an idea to help local businesses recover from the next big one. Small companies had found they just didn’t have the money to rebuild and keep the lights on until their customers returned. So in 2008, Congress created three new programs to get loans to small businesses quickly. Since the new emergency lending programs were born, American small businesses have been hit by Hurricane Irene, Hurricane Sandy, and other disasters. And here’s how many loans the new programs have secured for small businesses in that time: Zero. “Frankly, they didn’t do squat. They really didn’t do squat,” said William B. Shear, the director of Financial Markets and Community Investment for the GAO, who has written multiple reports on SBA’s preparation for disasters. “They really dropped the ball.” This week the Small Business Administration came under Congressional fire for what appears to be a total failure to execute the mission of issuing emergency loans. A long trail of GAO reports details this record of failure, and the SBA’s perplexing inability to explain why businesses haven’t received a dollar yet, a need that is expected to become only more acute as a changing climate brings more drastic storms. “There’s a lot of work that needs to be done within the agency to get the kinks worked out,” said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.). “With climate change, we’re going to be facing disasters like this in highly populated areas, and they have to be able to be far more efficient and far more transparent.” Behind the seven-year saga appears to be a mixture of bureaucratic inertia, miscommunication and inattention. But it also speaks to the difficulty of launching public-private financial partnerships, especially if they require banks to make risky loans on the government’s terms. Under the 2008 law, the SBA was directed to create three loan guarantee programs, using private-sector lenders to supply quick money to help businesses recover after a disaster, in at most 36 hours. The government would act as a backstop for the small but risky loans, guaranteeing that banks would receive 85 percent of the loan value if it goes bad. It appeared, at first, that the agency was making a legitimate effort to start making loans. It asked for—and received—$3 million for a pilot program of one of the loan programs to determine the interest of lenders and borrowers, and actually published a set of rules in 2010. James Rivera, the associate administrator of the SBA’s Office of Disaster Assistance, appeared before the House Small Business Committee Wednesday to explain why the SBA had decided to pilot just one of the three programs, against the 2008 law which required the agency to publish rules on all three programs. “To be honest with you, I don’t know why the other two regulatory programs were not implemented,” he said. “What I can do is I can check back with the Office of Capital Access and we can get back to you for the record.” According to GAO reports on the loan programs, the agency repeatedly promised the pilot version would commence soon. In May 2010, the SBA said it would happen by September 2010. In June 2012, the deadline had shifted to the end of that year. As of this Wednesday, it still hasn’t happened. Why not? A withering GAO report from last October documents two reasons: the electronic systems used to process the loans didn’t work well together, and – more crucially – lenders weren’t willing to take part. In an interview, Rivera told POLITICO that the SBA’s computer systems are now compatible and capable of dealing with the loans. The problem, he said, is getting banks on board: “Lenders just feel it’s too much risk based on what we get.” Making loans after a disaster is an inherently risky proposition, and Congress set strict standards on the loans: the interest rate is set by the agency, and borrowers must have at least 10 years to pay them back. According to the October GAO report, the SBA found that lenders were understandably hesitant to provide the loans, even with the government guaranteeing 85 percent repayment, unless Congress relaxed some of those conditions. Just one problem, which surfaced in Wednesday’s hearing: the SBA never actually told the House Small Business Committee it was having trouble with lenders. “We haven’t received anything,” Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, said in an interview. “That is basically an excuse.” Asked why it hadn’t mentioned this obstacle to Congress, the SBA provided POLITICO a copy of a letter it sent to two other committees in which it did explain that lenders objected to the rules. A spokesperson said \"the SBA has worked with Congress both formally and informally\" over time. But the agency just sent the letter in December 2014, despite knowing about these problems for years. (“This has been an ongoing conversation we’ve had with the lenders since the statute was passed,” Rivera told the committee Wednesday.) Even in the letter, the SBA didn’t offer any solutions. And when I asked Rivera what Congress might need to change to make the loans more appealing to lenders, he didn’t have much of an answer. “We’ll provide the response that they’re looking for,” he said of the Small Business Committee, “and how they respond to it, I just don’t know.” What happens next with the program? Lawmakers say they’ve run out of patience. “I think it’s taken them too little and too long for them to continue to improve,” Rep. Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.) told POLITICO. No lawmaker called for a change of leadership at the agency, but Velazquez and Steve Chabot, the chair of the House Small Business Committee, asked for a letter from SBA about when the loan programs will be up and running. And what happened to the $3 million that Congress appropriated in 2010? It was spent back then to deal with IT problems, said the SBA’s press secretary—fixing the computer systems for a program that still doesn’t exist.",

    "LabBody": "What's one of the best things about being a professional footballer? The money? The fame? Performing on the world stage? For Matildas defender Steph Catley it may be a little bit different, but it's definitely exciting. Catley has been unveiled as the new face of EA Sports Fifa 16, accompanying Lionel Messi on the cover of the Australian version of the game. The honour came as a shock to Catley, who was more than happy to be representing both the Matildas and women's football, with a woman gracing the cover of the highly anticipated game for the first time. \"I'm just kinda ecstatic that a female and a Matilda gets to be on the cover, it's an amazing thing to get that news in the first place and we were all going to be happy for whoever got it. I'm so excited to be the face, it's awesome,\" she said. Catley, a stalwart of the Australian side at the recent World Cup, saw off fellow Matildas teammates Kyah Simon and Katrina Gorry to claim the coveted honour. More than 9 million fans worldwide voted for the first time for their favourite player to be featured on the 2016 version of the game. Congratulations to @TheMatildas star @stephcatley – winner of the Australian #FIFA16 #CoverVoteAU! pic.twitter.com/cTaRrVHU2i— EA SPORTS FIFA ANZ (@EASPORTSFIFAANZ) July 10, 2015 Despite being one of the younger players in the squad at 21, Catley represented Australia in all five matches at the 2015 World Cup. The stoic defender, a lifelong fan of the Fifa game, was looking forward to playing as the Matildas within the game and hoped the inclusion of female teams would be a large step for women's football in the country. \"It's huge, obviously I played Fifa for a long time with my brother and we always played as the Socceroos a few times but to have the option to play as the Matildas and other [women's] national teams it's just incredible.\" Catley said \"I think women's football has come along way in general but it's just another huge stepping stone adding us to one of the biggest video games in the world that's played all over the world.\" With the World Cup behind her, Catley is firmly focused upon the upcoming season with her National Womens Soccer League Team, the Portland Thorns. Catley also plies her trade with the Melbourne Victory in the Australian W-League, being awarded the Female Footballer of the Year Award for the 2011-12 season. With the game featuring the women's format for the first time, Catley is more than excited at the prospect of controlling her own avatar and testing her out to see what she can do. \"Seeing the snapshots of us in the game, the images of us are so accurate it's kinda scary looking at yourself. I'm not really sure what it's going to be like to play myself as an out of body experience but I'm looking forward to it, it'll be interesting,\" she said. \"I might be able to sort of do things in the game that maybe I can't do in real life, which is really exciting.\" Fifa 16 will be released in Australia in late September this year.",

    "LabBody": "Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are setting much store by the returns on bank deposits in India. NRI deposit inflows in the first two months of the current financial year have nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. In the April-May 2015 period, NRIs deposited $4.60 billion in Indian banks, against $2.50 billion in the corresponding period last year, according to Reserve Bank of India data. NS Venkatesh, Executive Director, IDBI Bank, said the copious inflow into NRI deposits is because interest rates in India are attractive compared to the negative returns in the Euro Zone. Moreover, no tax is applicable on interest earned on Foreign Currency Non Resident (Bank) accounts and Non-Resident (External) Rupee accounts, and this is an added attraction for NRI deposits, he added “India is an oasis of stability in the ocean of turbulence (in the global financial markets). This has imparted a positive momentum to the flows into NRI deposits,” said Venkatesh. As on May 2015, total NRI deposits stood at $118.41 billion against $107.49 billion in May 2014. Rate of return A senior public sector bank treasury official said the rate of return in India for NRIs is positive, net of inflation. “In the backdrop of the cost of living in India going up (requiring more money to be sent back home by overseas Indian for maintenance purposes), more Indians going overseas for jobs and the crisis engulfing the Euro Zone, the NRI deposit inflows are expected to go up further,” he said.",

    "LabBody": "Living in a hot and humid state like Texas means you have probably encountered a few spiders, a trail of ants or an occasional cockroach in your home. Unfortunately, the occasional “home invader” could become more frequent thanks to weeks of constant rainfall and flooding. In the summertime, ants tend to be the biggest problem. The hotter weather causes them to enter homes and businesses in search of water and food. They generally get in through tiny gaps in bricks, around windows and through other holes and cracks. Also, don’t be surprised if you see more spiders and cockroaches than usual — these insects come out of the woodwork after rain. If your home is in or near a wooded area, fleas and ticks could be a problem. If your home is seeing more pests than usual, it may be time to call a pest control service business. In 2014, BBB received more than 4,000 complaints against pest control services nationwide. Many complaints alleged they paid for services that were not provided, extermination attempts were ineffective and companies hid high cancellation fees. To prevent pests, your Better Business Bureau serving Central, Coastal, Southwest Texas and the Permian Basin recommends: - Store food in sealed plastic or glass containers. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), consumers should try to remove sources of food, water and shelter that attract pests. Garbage containing food scraps should be sealed tightly; remove garbage regularly. - Fix leaky plumbing. Don’t let water accumulate in trays under your house, plants or refrigerator. Also, don’t leave pet food and water out overnight, as it could attract rodents and ants. - Get rid of clutter. While this is sometimes hard to avoid, especially in your garage, clutter provides places where pests can enter, hide or even make a home. Cover any holes with wire mesh and caulk cracks and crevices around cabinets or baseboards to keep pests out. - Learn about the pests around you. Research the kind of pests that could enter your home and the options to control them. If it is a persistent problem, your best option might be to hire an exterminator. When looking for a pest control service business or contractor, BBB advises consumers to: - Compare prices. Solicit bids from at least three different pest control companies before making a decision. BBB provides a free Request a Quote service to make it easier to gather estimates from local BBB Accredited Businesses. You can also go to checkbbb.org for a full list of BBB Accredited pest control services in the area. - Get references. Ask family and friends for recommendations from pest control companies they have used. Beware of companies that offer to give your house a free inspection for pests or pressure you for immediate or costly treatments. - Ask about safety. Because pesticides and pest control products can be dangerous to touch or inhale, be sure to ask the company about the safety of the chemicals they use. Let the company know if you have children, pets or sensitive plants as that may impact the products they select for your home. - Check for licensing and insurance. Always hire a qualified pest control company and verify they meet state licensing requirements with the Texas Department of Agriculture. Also, find out if the pest control company has liability insurance to cover any damages to your house or furnishings during treatment. - Carefully review your contract. Be sure you fully understand the nature of the pests to be exterminated, the extent of the infestation and the work necessary to solve the problem. - Get it in writing. Make sure the contract and all guarantees are clearly stated in writing with details about the service agreement. Be sure you understand what the company will do if pests continue or come back after treatment. For consumer information, BBB Business Reviews, to schedule a guest speaker or to file a complaint, visit Better Business Bureau online at bbb.org/central-texas.

    "LabBody": "The Lincoln Independent Business Association took the school board to task Tuesday for its proposed 2015-16 budget, which puts $10 million into its cash reserve rather than taxpayers’ pockets. “LIBA is here tonight to ask for property tax relief,” Wanda Caffrey, chairman of the organization’s school liaison committee, told the Lincoln Board of Education. “If you do not lower your levy you will be taking another $32 million from the citizens of Lincoln. From the $32 million you intend to put $10 million into savings. LIBA thinks that this is just too much.” The proposed $386 million general fund budget keeps the tax levy the same as last year, despite a substantial increase in property valuations and state aid. Total revenue is expected to increase 8.9 percent -- or $32.4 million, $10 million of which district officials want to put in the cash reserve. Caffrey called that an “extreme measure” and proposed that instead the district lower its general fund tax rate by 3 cents, to $1.02 per $100 of valuation. That still would allow the district to put some money in its reserve, she said. “Yes, you can fully fund your needs, you can lower the levy and still add to the reserve,” she said. Not counting the cash reserve, the proposed $386 million general fund budget is 6.05 percent higher than the current budget. Among the increases: $6 million for additional staffing, $10.5 million to pay for salary and benefit increases and $1.4 million for operating costs for the new Career Academy. LPS officials propose keeping the general fund tax levy at $1.05 per $100 of valuation, the cap set by the Legislature, and levies for bond funds and the Education Service Unit that serves the district also would remain unchanged. That means the total tax levy to support LPS would remain at $1.259. Under the proposed budget the owner of a $150,000 home would pay $1,888 to support LPS, assuming no increase in the valuation of the home. Putting money in cash reserve is taking it out of the Lincoln economy that could be used to pay bills and purchase necessities, Caffrey said. She reminded the board that Lincoln residents approved a $153 million bond issue last year. “Now would be a great time to give back through property tax relief,” she said. \"You can offer property tax relief and not have to close one classroom, not have to fire a single employee, and you will not have to cut one program.” Reach the writer at 402-473-7226 or mreist@journalstar.com.",

    "LabBody": "It’s that rosé time of year - and of course usually we just chill our pinks, simply pouring them on their own as refreshing aperitifs, or as partners for seafood, charcuterie, salads, fresh fruit... But in case you get bored of your rosé, you can easily make cocktails with it. Here are some ideas to get you started. Bear in mind that styles of rosé vary a great deal, from crisp and bone-dry to richer, juicy and medium-sweet, and, of course, sparkling. If it matters which style you use in a particular cocktail recipe, I have said so below - otherwise, just pour your favourite pink. But (important, this) always ensure your rosé is fresh and young, as its lovely scent and vivacious, tangy flavour should stand out, even in a cocktail. (Each recipe makes one drink.) (ALAMY) INGREDIENTS 100ml rich fruity rosé ( a bright New World label) 20ml raspberry-flavoured vodka 40ml pink grapefruit juice Chilled cherryade to top up Maraschino cherry to garnish (optional) METHOD Pour the wine, vodka and juice into a tall tumbler half-filled with ice. Stir gently then top up with cherryade, adding as much or as little as you like (bearing in mind the cherryade is sweet). Garnish with the maraschino cherry. Kir Blush A take on the classic white wine kir, this simply replaces the white with pink for a more succulent, more fruity version. INGREDIENTS 125ml dry but fruity rosé wine (try Rhone or Bordeaux rosé), well-chilled 25ml crème de cassis METHOD Pour the cassis into the base of a normal white wine glass, then top up with the rosé. Blackberry Bellini (ALAMY) INGREDIENTS 100ml cold sparkling rosé (preferably pink prosecco) A handful of ripe, juicy blackberries 30ml plain vodka 10ml lemon juice One teaspoon caster sugar METHOD Place the blackberries in a cocktail shaker and muddle - gently squash them - with the back of a long spoon. Add ice cubes, vodka, lemon juice and sugar and shake, then strain into a champagne flute. Top up with cold sparkling rosé. Sangria In The Pink INGREDIENTS 100ml fruity rosé, ideally a Spanish rosado 50ml fresh orange juice 10ml brandy 10ml orange liqueur 75ml lemonade Fresh orange and lemon slices to garnish METHOD Pour all the ingredients, the lemonade last, into a large tumbler with a few ice cubes in it, stir gently and garnish with the fruit slices. Coming up Roses A dry and elegant sip. (ALAMY) INGREDIENTS 100ml pale, delicate rosé, in the Provencal style, very cold 10-30ml rosewater, to taste Dash of lime juice Rose petal to garnish (from an unsprayed rose) METHOD Chill a small wine glass in the fridge for at least an hour. Simply pour the wine and lime juice into the glass, adding the rosewater gradually until you have the right strength for you, then serve straight away, with a rose petal floating on top. The glass should be frosty. Rosy Gimlet INGREDIENTS 75ml rosé wine 25ml gin 25ml lime cordial Thin strip of lime zest METHOD Pour the wine, gin and cordial into cocktail shaker with ice, stir until cold then strain into a martini glass. Twist the lime zest strip to release its citrus oil and float it on the top. West Coast Sunset: INGREDIENTS 100ml fruity, ripe Californian rosé 75ml light syrup from a tin of strawberries Dessertspoon mango sorbet Squeeze of fresh orange juice METHOD Half-fill a tumbler with crushed ice then pour in the wine, strawberry syrup and squeeze in a dash of OJ. Add the mango sorbet and stir gently. Serve with a straw. Peppermint Rosé INGREDIENTS 100ml dry rosé, chilled 3 fresh, top sprigs of mint plus extra leaf or two for garnish 10ml sugar syrup (make simple syrup by stirring equal volumes of caster sugar and water together until sugar is dissolved) Twist of white pepper (optional) Sparkling water, chilled METHOD Wash the 3 sprigs of mint, shake them dry then muddle (ie lightly bruise with the back of a spoon) in a cocktail shaker with a lump of ice, the sugar syrup and a twist of white pepper. Strain into a large wine glass, add the rosé and top up with sparkling water. Garnish with few mint leaves. Cranberry Spritz INGREDIENTS 80-100ml dry sparkling rosé, chilled (pink cava is good here) 40ml cranberry juice, chilled 10ml crème de cassis METHOD Pour the cranberry juice and crème de cassis into a Champagne flute and top up with sparkling rosé. Serve immediately. Pink Glow INGREDIENTS 100ml ripe rosé wine (so Californian or Australian) 40ml bourbon whiskey 20ml smooth orange juice Orange wedge to garnish METHOD Shake the ingredients together in a cocktail shaker with ice then strain into a chunky tumbler with more ice cubes, perch the orange wedge on the edge of the glass and serve.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Strike up the band! The resistance band that is. Whether you are on the road, or barricaded in your home recovering from the death of your favorite Game of Thrones character, a total body workout is always accessible due to the portability and convenience of the resistance band. These flexible flab fighters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making them perfect for your daily exercise routine or assisted stretching (or to sling shot water balloons at that noisy neighbor). Here’s how to make the most of this one-man resistance band show: Chest to Impress. Find a sturdy support beam or column and evenly wrap your band around it at shoulder height. With your back turned away from the supporting structure, grab each handle and take a large step forward. The beauty of the band is that you can adjust its resistance simply by removing slack from the tube. The further you step away from the column, the harder the exercise becomes. With palms at shoulder height, push through your chest until your arms are completely extended. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions. Reverse Gears. The next exercise requires a similar setup, however you will be facing your support column rather than having your back to it. With a handle in each hand, take a big step backwards while pulling your hands in towards either side of your ribcage. Bring your feet back to center, and perform the same exercise with the opposite foot. The reverse lunge row is a powerful movement in that it targets major muscle groups and aids in bettering your balance. Balancing exercises should be incorporated into every workout routine, as they are crucial in strengthening your core, improving the integrity of your spine and preventing injuries from falls. Complete 15 repetitions per side. Squat What You Got. The squat shoulder press is a triple threat exercise in that it hits several major muscle groups in a single motion. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and secure the resistance band evenly beneath the midline of each foot. While holding each handle close to the shoulder, squat down until the back of your thighs are parallel with the floor. While keeping your core muscles activated, push through your heels and drive your hands linearly towards the ceiling. That is one repetition. Repeat this movement twenty times to torch those hamstrings, quads, glutes and arms. Bi’s and Tri’s. When working the bicep muscle don’t forget to include its counterpart - the tricep. An overworked bicep and neglected tricep muscle will cause what I refer to as, “The Dinosaur Arm.” If you’d like an example of what this condition looks like, scan the fitness floor for the grunting guy in the ripped Gold’s Gym t-shirt who is curling three hundred pounds of dumbbell in each hand. (He tends to linger at close proximity to the mirror.) To avoid becoming “That Guy,” stand with feet shoulder width apart, with a resistance band handle in both hands. Focusing on your bicep, squeeze your hands up to your shoulders. Following this motion, extend your arms back down to either side of your hips. After completing 12-15 repetitions, adjust your feet so the resistance band handle is secure under your heel. Grab the other hand from behind and extend your arm up over your head. Crank out 12-15 repetitions. Repeat each exercise 3-5 times to guarantee a good burn, baby burn. Sometimes the best cure in the fight against fat is to apply a little resistance band-aid. Earn it.

    "DiffbotBody": "It’s been a rough few weeks for Sarah Palin… Last month, the country was shocked when her daughter Bristol Palin called off her wedding to Sgt. Dakota Meyer just days before it was set to take place amidst claims he had been married to a “secret wife” years before. Weeks later, it was revealed that Bristol is currently pregnant with her second child out of wedlock, and she has no plans to get married anytime soon. In the middle of those scandals, Fox News parted ways with Palin when they decided not to renew her million dollar contract last month. Now, Palin has just quietly announced that she will be shutting down the subscription-based sarahpalinchannel.com just a year after it debuted. According to Mediaite, the site offered exclusive Palin content for an annual subscription fee of $99.95, and they will now be giving a refund for the remainder of the year to all customers. Here’s the full statement the Palins put on the website: Effective August 1st, the Governor will be making all of her content free on her Facebook page and at SarahPac.com. • If you are a monthly subscriber here on SarahPalinChannel.com, you will not be charged anything after this month. There’s nothing that you need to do. • If you are an annual subscriber, you can have the balance of your subscription refunded to your credit card or you can roll your subscription into one of the other channels on our network. If you choose this option, you’ll get an EXTRA month absolutely FREE. Our networks include: – New Life TV – Recharge your relationships and grow closer to God – Alive with Joan Lunden – A vibrant community for women’s wellness and breast cancer patients and survivors – K-Love TV – Christian Rock, Inspiration, and Family Values Palin also issued a video message in which she did her best to make the change look like a positive thing. “It’s starting August 1st, everything’s free, and just to let you know, that it is an honor to have you subscribe, really it’s been so illuminating and still is so illuminating to read and to respond to many of your insightful comments about current events, about so many things going on in our world today,” Palin said in her video message. She went on to claim that this decision to make all content free stems from a desire to, “make sure that your voices and mine are heard by the widest possible audience across this great land of ours” during the next election. While this sounds nice, it also reveals that Palin was not getting the amount of subscribers she was looking for. She would not be making all the content free if she was making a good amount of money with subscribers, so this change reveals that Palin is not doing as well business-wise as she might have thought. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the entire Palin family. We need to keep them in our prayers!",

    "LabBody": "Kim Kardashian has become more private after she got married to Kanye West. West is a very private person on social media and rarely shares anything from his private life. In fact, he is rarely on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. As for Kim, she used to share every single thing from her life, including selfies from her bathroom and pictures from photo shoots. And while that attitude has changed, she got personal and shared several pictures of her daughter this week. According to a new tweet, Kim Kardashian is now sharing lots of pictures of her daughter North West to celebrate Kourtney’s daughter’s birthday, which was yesterday. Kardashian has been a bit protective of little North, but yesterday Kim went all out with pictures of the Kardashian children. “Happy Birthday P! Your bday was yest \u0026we were celebrating! Thx 4 being the best big cousin North always looks up to!” Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter while sharing plenty of pictures of North with her cousin Penelope. Happy Birthday P! Your bday was yest \u0026we were celebrating! Thx 4 being the best big cousin North always looks up to! pic.twitter.com/C6Qm3SZvup — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 9, 2015.

Of course, Kim’s sister Kourtney is dealing with a very public breakup these days. Even though Kourtney hasn’t confirmed anything, it seems like her sisters are rallying around her. In addition, none of them have posted anything directed at Scott Disick in an obvious manner. Kim’s strategy appears to be focusing on the children. In all of these birthday posts, Kim is focusing on Penelope and North. Penelope is Kourtney and Scott’s second child of three. Penelope has been featured on Keeping Up with the Kardashians a few times, but North has not. In other words, these celebratory pictures are a bit out of the ordinary. What do you think of Kim Kardashian posting pictures of the children to celebrate Penelope’s birthday? Do you think Kim is trying to divert attention away from Kourtney by posting pictures of the children?",

    "LabBody": "VATICAN CITY, Holy See – The first ever trial of a former Vatican official accused of pedophile crimes opens Saturday at the Holy See in what is viewed as belated Church efforts to battle child abusers among the clergy. The unprecedented trial will hear the case of former Polish archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, who is accused of possessing child pornography in Rome in 2013-14, and the sexual abuse of minors during his 2008-13 stint as the Vatican nuncio, or ambassador, in the Dominican Republic. Wesolowski, 66, was secretly recalled from his posting in 2012 after the Church hierarchy was informed that he was regularly paying young Dominican boys for sexual services. He was defrocked by a Church court in June 2014 but remained free until September of that year, when he was placed under house arrest -- reportedly for reasons of failing health -- under an order the Vatican said came directly from Pope Francis. His trial marks the first legal proceedings against a church official under a Vatican justice system redesigned by Francis in response to accusations of sexual abuse of children by priests that have multiplied as thousands of victims have spoken out around the world. If Wesolowski is convicted in the trial, in which the judge, defense lawyer and prosecutors are all Italian lay people, he could face a six-year prison sentence -- more if aggravated circumstances are found -- which he could serve in Vatican detention facilities. Test case He is seen as a test case in Francis's push to take a more active role in prosecuting predators in the face of accusations from abuse victims, their families and supporters that the Catholic Church has not done enough to identify and punish pedophiles in its midst. \"The (pornography) case is based on an offence introduced to Vatican legislation by Francis in 2013. The other involves sexual abuse of minors prosecuted on the case assembled by legal authorities of Santo Domingo,\" the Vatican said in a statement ahead of the trial. \"These serious allegations will be scrutinized by the competent judicial body, which will be assisted by both technical appraisals of the IT systems used by the defendant and, if necessary, international legal cooperation for the evaluation of testimonial evidence from the competent authorities in Santo Domingo,\" it said. According to the Italian-language weekly Panorama, the tribunal may request testimony from Dominican deacon Francisco Javier Occi Reyes, who was arrested in Santo Domingo accused of having put Wesolowski in contact with minors. The first day of the proceedings will be open to the public, and the trial is then expected to recess before reconvening in September. At that time Wesolowski's lawyers may motion for it to continue in closed session. While the case marks the first time a Vatican court will hear child sexual abuse charges against a former Church official, it is not the first time its legal process has been used to hear charges of alleged wrong-doing. In 2012 the Vatican tribunal drew world-wide attention when it heard a case against Paolo Gabriele, Pope Benedict's former personal butler, for accusations he leaked secret documents to the press.",

    "LabBody": "(BPT) - From wall stains to washing machines, indoor stains and smells can be a challenge to tackle. Luckily, there are surprisingly simple methods to erase them for good. Here are a few tips to freshen up the most stubborn spots in your home. Conceal wall stains with primer. Have your kids made artwork of your walls, or has your leaky roof caused a water-damaged mess? Tough wall stains like these can be hard to get rid of, but are easily sealed by applying a high-quality, stain-blocking primer. For example, KILZ Hide-All Primer Sealer covers problem areas on surfaces from drywall and woodwork to concrete and brick. It even masks over dark stains without allowing color to bleed through. With only a one-hour drying time before applying a topcoat, this is the perfect one-weekend project to cross off your list. KILZ primer can also seal off odors caused by pets or smoke. Eliminate refrigerator odors. Refrigerators are subject to a variety of spills and odors. Making time for fridge maintenance can help prevent unusual odors and keep your food fresh longer. To cleanse and polish your fridge, begin by emptying the contents of your fridge and throwing out, recycling or composting any food that is expired or beginning to smell. Next, pull out any removable drawers or shelving and place them in the sink. Using a damp, soft cloth or non-abrasive sponge, wipe down these pieces, the interior of your fridge and the door with a multi-purpose cleaner. Or, mix two tablespoons of baking soda with one quart of hot water for a natural soap alternative. Don’t forget the seams of the shelves and rubber door seal. If your fridge requires an extra-deep cleaning, unplug it while you work to avoid wasting energy. Before putting all of your food back into the fridge, wipe down the exterior of each jar or container with a damp cloth. Repeat this process every two or three months for the best results. Make grout lines shine. Tile surfaces are prone to dirt and debris, especially in bathrooms or high-traffic areas. To keep tile looking fresh and new, grab an old toothbrush or electric toothbrush for a deeper scrub. Before you start, wash the surface with water then mix two parts baking soda with one part water. Scrub the resulting paste into the cracks and crevices, then douse with water again. If the grout lines are stained, spray a mixture of equal parts vinegar and warm water onto the area and brush. After a final rinse, the grime will be gone. Prevent a moldy washing machine. If you own a front-loading washing machine, you’ve probably noticed the unpleasant smell that can linger after completing a load of laundry. Despite being more energy-efficient, these machines have a tendency to hold odors and harbor mold. To clean and prevent grimy buildup, try this: instead of detergent, cycle two cups of vinegar and a quarter-cup of baking soda on a hot setting. When it’s done, use a clean sponge to scrub down the inside. Finally, rinse with a plain-water cycle, and you’ll see (and smell) the results. Whether in the kitchen, bathroom or laundry room, tricky stains and odors in your home can be a tough job, but with these four tips you’ll be able to eliminate a few messy tasks in no time.",

    "DiffbotBody": "Habitat Loss, White Nose Syndrome and Bats in the South Believe it or not, there are some people in the South who love watching bats the way others love watching birds. If that’s you, and you’ve noticed fewer bats in recent years, know you aren’t imagining things. Even if you find bats kind of creepy, experts say you might change your tune once the bugs they eat become pests in greater numbers in the Summer. That’s because bats in the South are under pressure. The first ever survey of bats at the Ocmulgee National Monument is part of the larger effort by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to establish a baseline for bat numbers before pressures do them in. The DNR only started looking hard at bats around six years ago when a disease started wiping out whole caves worth of them in the Northeast. “You know, we knew that White Nose Syndrome was coming. It was sad, you could watch it spreading south,” said Jaclyn Beck, the DNR research coordinator leading the Ocmulgee survey. On a recent evening, the sun was setting on Walnut Creek in the Ocmulgee National monument as Beck and another researcher, Rebekah Tuck, were stringing a huge net — 9 yards wide and 20 feet high, across the creek. It was a bat trap. Mist netting like this, paired with acoustic surveys and cave searches, are the methods Beck and others use in North Georgia to get a good look at bat populations there. What they’ve seen isn’t good. “Our populations have gone down 82% since we found white nose in Georgia,” Beck said. Trina Morris is a non-game biologist with DNR. She says that 82% drop only started in 2013. But, it was mostly confined to one animal, the Tri-Colored bat. “We haven’t really focused on that species in the past, because it was really common,” Morris said. White Nose Syndrome is changing that. The Tri-Colored bat ranges from the caves of North Georgia down to Florida. Morris says Middle Georgia Tri-Coloreds may live here year-round or migrate north in the winter. That could make Middle Georgia an important Tri-Colored refuge. “It could be that we end up with only good populations of Tri-Colored bats in the coastal plain of Georgia,” Morris said. Part of writing up the measurements of bats that get caught in a study or survey includes a map of the area in which they were caught., left. Researchers often use a batting glove, right, on one hand to protect themselves while untangling bats from mist nets. They also as a rule have already been inoculated against Rabies, though research coordinator Jaclyn Beck says the idea that Rabies is widespread in bats is largely a myth. Photos by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting At the net site, a hooting owl was making the researchers antsy. “Owls are bad news for bat,” Jaclyn Beck said. Turns out an owl can catch a bat on the wing. So the researchers waited. The owl hooted again. “No one’s impressed, owl,” said Sarah Sherburne, another one of the researchers. Jaclyn Beck and Sarah Sherburne use a high powered spotlight to check the creek net for a bat. “Not even a bug,” Beck said as they walked back to their work station So they waited some more. There’s another bat Jaclyn Beck would have loved to have seen here, the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat. “It’s ears are about the length of its body,” she said. “It looks like no other bat we have in Georgia.” It’s rare, too, though that has nothing to do with White Nose Syndrome. Instead it’s the natural nesting sites for the Rafinesque Long Ear Bat that are the problem. It needs mature cypress or tupelo trees in deep swamps. There aren’t many of those left. Sarah Sherburne and the third researchers, Rebekah Tuck, looked during the day for roosts that could be used for Rafinesque Long Ears. After a few more checks, the researchers had success. There was a bat in the net across the creek. Sherburne and Tuck quickly got in the water to untangle the bat. “It’s going to take me a little bit, he’s pretty bad,” Sherburne said. As badly as the animal was tangled, Tuck said they had to be careful. “Their toes are so tiny you could dislocate them or like mess up a wing, so you have to be really gentle,” Tuck said. They finally worked it loose. Back at their work stations they recorded the bat’s measurements. It was neither a Tri-Colored nor a Rafinesque Long Ear, but an Evening Bat. It made a constant, ratcheting noise as they got started. “So you can hear him, chirping away,” Beck said. Turned out “he” was a “she”. “So there’s a nipple in there pretty extended,” Beck said. “And she’s lactating right now.” Which meant there were pups in a tree roost somewhere. “Her wings are lovely,” Beck said. “She doesn’t have any scars or tears.” Which meant she was in good health, too. By the time they were done, it was time to check the nets again. They found another Evening Bat, another adult female. This one was more squirmy. “Hey now, this is not how this is going to go down,” Rebekah Tuck said as she handled it. Rebekah Tuck blows gently into the face of a female evening bat while handling it for scientific measurements. That’s a trick that often makes bats quit gnawing on researchers hands. Photo by Grant Blankenship/Georgia Public Broadcasting She was lactating, too. So there was another set of pups somewhere. By the end of the month of netting and searching, these two evening bats, plus a big brown bat the night after, were all the researchers caught. There were no Tri-Coloreds. The researchers had wanted to extend the day time searches for the Rafinesque Long Ear to private property adjacent to the monument. But that might have to wait until the land in question gets folded into the Ocmulgee Monument property. That could be years away if it happens at all. There’s one more source of data that could change the picture. The researchers have been recording bat calls with a device called an Anabat during the survey. Comparing those sounds of bats they never saw to the netting and daytime survey numbers will give the ultimate context. Still, as Jaclyn Beck helped finish up with the second Evening Bat, she saw a bright side. “Babies are coming!” she exclaimed. Despite knowing the pressures on bats elsewhere, these researchers were happy knowing there were new born bats out in the woods.",

It’s not just in Georgia where bat numbers are declining. And it’s not just due to White-Nose Syndrome. Laura Ellison, a bat expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, says there’s been a sense that bats have been in trouble across North America for decades. “Back in the ‘70s bat biologists were concerned about places they were going to that they’d been to for long periods of time,” Ellison said. Ellison said that gut feeling that something has been wrong with bats for a while has never been fully explored. “Because in the past they haven’t really been on people’s radar. Unless you’re a bat researcher or had them roosting in your house or saw a bat in the daytime.” Ellison said, “But now they’re more in the public eye.” That might be the only upshot to White-Nose Syndrome. Taking advantage of that new visibility, Ellison is coordinating the North American Bat Monitoring Program. Ellison and others have authored guidelines for scientists and wildlife agencies to collect data uniformly. “And now we’re trying to figure out a way to quantify that and make it so we can say something about bat populations across a large scale like the continent,” she said. The idea is that going forward, numbers from, say, Kentucky will make sense in Canada. This has never been attempted before. This summer is the pilot project.

    "LabBody": "NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Stock Exchange said an outage of more than three hours was caused by problems associated with a software upgrade on the exchange's computers. The NYSE said in a statement Thursday that the upgrade caused communication problems between its trading software and other systems, causing customers' orders to not go through. The problem became severe enough by late morning Wednesday that the exchange decided to suspend trading at 11:32 a.m. Eastern time so the problem could be addressed. Orders were cancelled, trading software was restarted and backup units were brought online, the exchange said. The exchange restarted trading at 3:10 p.m. Eastern. Wednesday's shutdown was a black eye for the NYSE, but ultimately it did not broadly impact Wednesday's trading. The Nasdaq still operated normally and several other exchanges were also available for investors to execute trades while the NYSE worked through its problems. While the exchange was only open for 50 minutes in the afternoon, it was enough time for investors to close out their positions for the day. The outage came at a time when traders had plenty of other things to worry about. There have been concerns about China's plunging stock market and a logjam in talks between Greece and its creditors that has weighed on investors' mood all week. • Check us out and like Yourwestvalley.com on Facebook and YourWVNews on Twitter.",

    "LabBody": "By BETTY MONTGOMERYFor the Herald-Journal Gardening with summer flowering bulbs can electrify the garden with spectacular colors. Even if you have an established garden, a few bulbs tucked in among perennials or shrubs can add an exotic touch. Some of these bulbs are tropical and will not winter over while other ones will settle in quite nicely and liven up your landscape. Here are just a few of the many bulbs that are available. Agapanthus, or Lily of the Nile. Agapanthus, or Lily of the Nile, is an exquisite and dramatic looking blue or white flower that grows on a slender stem above green foliage that resembles amaryllis foliage. Up until fairly recently, agapanthus has not been hardy in zone 7 — our climate zone. It could be grown successfully in pots that would winter over in a warmer place but agapanthus would not winter over in the garden. Work has been done to make this bulb more cold tolerant and now there are several varieties that perform great year after year planted in the garden. Storm Cloud and Summer Skies have both returned for some years now in our garden. Storm Cloud has a larger flower and Summer Skies is more cold hardy. u Crinum lily (Crinum spp.), sometimes called Swamp Lilies, are members of the amaryllis family. These bulbs are newer to my garden. They bloom on top of a tall stem with wide foliage. Because of its height, it is best tucked in the back of the perennial border or behind low growing shrubs. u Dahlias are one of the most versatile bulbs (tubers) for the summer garden. They come in all sizes and shapes. You can find plants that are about 24-inches to 6-feet tall. The flowers can be small, daisy-like or double ones the size of a dinner plant. I happen to grow one variety that is single and medium height but there are others that are much more dramatic in appearance. Dahlia blooms come in nearly every color of the rainbow. u Eucomis or Pineapple Lily looks exotic with its blooms being crowned by a tuft of leaves similar to a pineapple. It is a fairly short plant, growing to about 18 inches. The flower can be white, greenish or have purple highlights. I have had them for years and it is always a conservation piece. u Gladiolus murielae are prized because they are easy to grow and have a lovely fragrance in the evening. They have tall, upright foliage that can get between 2- and 3-feet tall and can fill a blank space in the back of the border. Plant the corms 2- to 3-inches deep in well-drained soil in a sunny location. u Lilies have different varieties that bloom from early June until August. I plant all the Easter I get during the holiday and the flowers usually bloom the following year in June. Asiatic lilies bloom in early to mid June and come in an array of colors. Next come the Tiger lilies, which come in white, yellow and orange, and they bloom in that order. Starting in July, Oriental lilies open up and they are fragrant and are strikingly beautiful. There are many varieties with Casa Blanca, a pure white, being the most sought after. The species lily, Rubrum is the last one to flower in my garden and it grows quite tall, about 5 to 6 feet. It is possibly my favorite. u Zantedeschia, also called Calla Lily is another that is hardy in zone 7. You have to look carefully because the ones in the florist are not cold hardy. They love full sun and water, and if you have a ditch or damp spot, they will thrive and multiply and give you a wonderful show of white flowers. u Zephyranthes, often called Rain Lilies, often open up after a rain, giving them the common name of rain lilies. I first came across Rain Lilies at Montrose Garden in Hillsboro, N.C., where Nancy Goodwin had them growing in her garden. I was taken by them and bought a few to plant in our garden. They multiply easily and if the winter is not too cold, the narrow, grass-like foliage stays green through the winter season. They are only about 10- to 12-inches tall, but look lovely in a spot where they get extra water after it rains. I have them near a low spot that catches some rain. There are many more bulbs available that are striking and dramatic. This is just a sampling of what is available to you. I have had great luck with these and I hope you will try some, too. Remember, not all of these are cold hardy unless you seek to find the ones that have more cold hardiness. There are bulb companies that specialize in a wide range of exotic bulbs for our zone 7 gardens. Betty Montgomery, author and master gardener, can be reached at bmontgomery40@gmail.com.",

In 1996, the store was bought and started expanding. There are now close to 300 locations today. HEADQUARTERS: Chicago, Illinois TRADEMARK SANDWICH: \"A Wreck;\" includes Black Angus roast beef, old world salami, oven roasted turkey breast, hickory smoked ham and Swiss cheese. - Information from www.potbelly.com. Potbelly Sandwich Shop, a fast-casual restaurant chain, is looking to open up a location in Cayuga County. The sandwich chain has more than 300 locations nationwide and is known for its toasted sandwiches and hand-dipped milkshakes. The company announced in a press release Wednesday that it is reviewing potential franchisees in Auburn, Weedsport and Melrose Park. The company currently has a handful of locations in the New York City area but none upstate. That appears that is likely to change. Along with the Auburn announcement, the company has also expressed interest in finding franchisees for locations in Syracuse, Buffalo, Rochester, Albany and Schenectady. Auburn and Weedsport are the smallest markets in New York out of those that Potbelly has publicly targeted. Rick Fossali, senior director of domestic franchising for Potbelly Sandwich Shops, said that while the company often focuses growth on more populated areas, the demographics of Auburn and Weedsport could also be a good fit. \"The surrounding areas that support cities, Syracuse or otherwise, where people live and where they are on weekends are good places for us to be,\" Fossali said. Fossali said part of the goal is to be in areas that can draw a large lunch crowd. Potbelly's promise is \"fresh, fast and friendly.\" That promise includes a guarantee that a customer will get through the line and have their food in eight minutes or fewer.

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday on Obama's appointment of acting Highway Administrator Greg Nadeau to a full term atop the nation's road agency. Nadeau has been holding the highway administrator position on an interim basis since 2013, when the agency's former chief, Victor Mendez, was appointed to the deputy Transportation secretary position by Obama. If he is confirmed, Nadeau will likely serve out the remainder of Obama's term in office. Prior to Nadeau's permanent appointment, Republicans criticized the president for allowing a number of transportation-related regulatory positions to remain vacant. Lawmakers have recently approved appointments from Obama for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), but there are still interim chiefs in place at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHSMA).

    "LabBody": "Four years ago, an Apple patent surfaced that outlined how the consumer electronics company might become something called an MVNO. Rumors to that effect have persisted for years, most recently resurfacing this week at Business Insider. Apple swatted the latest aside, telling CNBC that it hasn’t discussed and isn’t planning anything of the sort. And that’s a shame, because it absolutely should. MVNO may sound like an obscure pharmaceutical stock ticker symbol, but it stands for “mobile virtual network operator,” which is admittedly still pretty inscrutable. In practice, though, it’s very straightforward, explains telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan. “An MVNO is simply a reseller,” says Kagan. “It’s a company who strikes up an agreement with a wireless network to sell wireless service without owning their own networks.” Think of it as Costco, but for wireless service. In the same way that your favorite bulk toilet paper provider repackages name-brand cereal for its Kirkland Signature private label, MVNOs like Republic Wireless (Sprint) and MetroPCS (T-Mobile) are simply selling you access to a larger carrier’s network, often for less than their affiliated providers charge. Take, for instance, Straight Talk, an MVNO owned by TracFone and available in Walmart retail locations. Straight Talk piggybacks on both GSM (T-Mobile, AT\u0026T) and DCMA (Verizon, Sprint) networks, while offering an unlimited talk, text, and data plan for $45 per month, a significant discount compared to any of the big four carriers supplying the bandwidth. It’s able to do so in part because it’s bought up wholesale access to those networks on the cheap, and in part because the scale enabled by its Walmart partnership makes thin margins more feasible. The other way MVNOs make money? No overhead. “They have no network to invest in, so there’s very little capital expense” explains Iain Gillott, president of iGR, a research firm that specializes in the wireless and mobile industry. That freedom from having to build and maintain massive networks also enables MVNOs to seek out very specific audiences. “Since they do not have to invest in networks, they can afford to target niches,” Gillott goes on. “Prices are usually better, or at least they offer more value for similar dollars, but often MVNOs will not offer the same range of services.” Republic Wireless and Straight Talk and MetroPC may be the best-known MVNOs (TracFone alone has around 30 million subscribers), but the one that may be most relevant to Apple-oriented speculation is one of the smallest, and most recent: Google’s Project Fi. High-Fi. Google launched Project Fi this past April. Next to more established MVNOs, it operates on an infinitesimal scale, available only on the company’s flagship Nexus 6 smartphone. What Project Fi lacks in breadth, though, it makes up for in innovation. More importantly, it provides a blueprint for any similar ambitions Apple might have. Project Fi offers a few features that are hard to come by among traditional carriers. Chief among those, and most common to MVNO, is a more competitive pricing scheme. In this case, you pay $20 per month for unlimited talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage, and then an additional $10 per month for each GB of data you use. Crucially, though, you only pay for what you actually consume; chew through 1.5GB in a month you paid for 2GB, and you get $5 credited back to your account. The real key to Project Fi, though, is that Google bought up network access from both T-Mobile and Sprint. Whichever network is more reliable where you are in that moment, that’s the one to which your phone will connect. “Not all carriers are good in all places,” explains Gillott, “but in each market, a few carriers are very good. The problem is that they vary.” By hedging its network bets—and offering a seamless Wi-Fi to cellular handoff—Project Fi phones are better steeled against dropped calls and fuzzy connections than phones that rely on a single network. Sounds good! But why so small? In part because it’s an entirely new business for Google, and a small pilot program helps determine whether it’s worth a more aggressive push. It also, though, doesn’t necessarily need huge scale to be effective. “I look at Google Fi in the same way as Google Fiber,” says Gillott, referencing Google’s equally disruptive, small-scale broadband play. “Has it had any operating impact on AT\u0026T, Verizon, and the cable companies? No, but the fear of Google Fiber did make all the broadband folks sit up and invest in their networks. I get 100 Mbps from TWC for the same price I used to pay for 15 Mbps.” Similarly, the mere threat of an expanding Project Fi could potentially effect change among the big four U.S. carriers. It’s worth spending so much time on Project Fi because this is the exact lens through which Apple would be looking at an MVNO of its own: A chance to reshape the unpopular industry on which its most important product relies. Apple the MVNO. “Apple has been playing with the MVNO idea for years,” says Forrester Research analyst Dan Bieler. “Ultimately, it is about a power struggle with the telcos.” The impetus for that kind of grappling should be apparent to anyone who’s ever spent time on hold with Verizon, or waded through fine print mined with early termination fees. Apple is popular. Carriers are not. So why cede so much of your customer’s iPhone experience to the latter? It’s not a small gap, either. In the 2014 American Consumer Satisfaction Index, Apple ranked 15th overall, and just narrowly second (behind Amazon) among technology companies. AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint all sit near the bottom, while Verizon managed to split the difference, likely thanks to its perennially reliable coverage. Selling iPhones, then, must often feel like serving filet mignon in an Arby’s. No wonder Apple has been rumored to seek a way out. Especially one with such a relatively low barrier to entry. “You can get into the wireless business overnight at low cost by being an MVNO and seeing if it works,” says Kagan. If and when Apple changes its mind, you could expect it to follow the Project Fi model with a few improvements. It could tap into all four major U.S. network providers, providing even more comprehensive coverage than Google’s two-network MVNO. Apple could leverage its existing customer service chops to ease those common carrier pain points. It already has your credit card on file, which would streamline the billing process. Most important, though, it would have the opportunity to reshape the arcane pricing labyrinth that makes negotiating the current cellular landscape such a pain. “The more Apple can control the customer relationships, data collection, and revenue generation, the greater its influence will be… the emerging digital ecosystems,” explains Bieler. “I think Apple’s real intention is to force the traditional telcos to offer more competitive data and voice plans.” And as counterintuitive as it may sound, the entrenched carriers may very well let it. “They’re frenemies,” says Kagan. “It’s the way the industry operates. On the one hand you’re partners, on the other hand you’re competitors. It’s been that way forever.” It’s safe to assume that the maker of the world’s most popular high-end smartphone has plenty of leverage. You don’t even really need to assume, though; Apple’s already introduced a carrier-rankling iPad SIM card that lets you switch between AT\u0026T, T-Mobile, and Sprint data plans at will. There’s been some blowback (if you purchase an iPad direct from the carrier, the SIM will likely come locked down), but clearly not enough to dissuade Apple from pushing forward. Apple may be waving off the idea of an MVNO for now. It shouldn’t. Not if it wants what’s best for Apple, for its customers, and for anyone with a data plan. Go Back to Top.

    "DiffbotBody": "This past holiday weekend, American pop star Ariana Grande was filmed licking some donuts in a California bakery and then casually expressing her hatred for America. Grande has since apologized for the comments, but failed to acknowledge the donut-licking incident. While her actions were undeniably gross, we can’t help but wonder if licking someone else’s food is actually a public health concern. Saliva gets a bad rap for being gross, and rightfully so; it’s literally filled with bacteria and viruses. “The mouth is a perfect environment for growing bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It’s warm and dark, food goes in there several times a day, and there are lots of little nooks and crannies where food can get caught,” said dentist and oral microbiologist Donna Mager, of the Forsyth Institute, a nonprofit group that focuses on oral and craniofacial research, as reported by Discover Magazine. Some of the most common diseases which can spread through saliva are strep throat, the common cold, mumps, meningitis, herpes, mononucleosis, and more rare conditions such as foot-and-mouth disease, The Huffington Post reported. With that being said, just because saliva is filled with germs does not necessarily mean it’s particularly dangerous. Ever wonder why animals instinctively lick their wounds? It could be that Fido is onto something that we’ve overlooked. Along with germs and pathogens, saliva is also filled with unique antibodies and antimicrobial compounds that help to disable these germs and viruses. Even HIV can be destroyed by oral antibodies, which is why it’s nearly impossible to pass on the virus through saliva. Most of the bacteria in the mouth are anaerobic, meaning they cannot survive long in the presence of oxygen, or in the case of obligate anaerobes, cannot survive at all once they hit air. Some common examples of anaerobic bacteria include E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and C. botulinum. While each of these bacteria have different lifespans once they leave a body, one thing is for sure: Once they hit the air, the clock starts ticking. This means that, depending on the amount of time between Grande’s infamous donut licks and when that donut was eaten by an unsuspecting customer, the large majority of bacteria could have quite possibly died off quite soon after the moisture from her saliva dried up. Now while bacteria may be sensitive to the outside world, viruses, on the other hand, are quite resilient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hepatitis B can survive outside the body for at least seven days and still be capable of causing infection. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service reports that cold viruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for more than a week. Flu viruses have a shorter outside lifespan of only around a day, and stomach bugs, such as the norovirus, can last for weeks. With that being said, however, the effectiveness of the virus starts to decrease after about 24 hours of being outside of a host, so not too much cause for concern. Regardless of the public health risk licking donuts may be, health authorities aren’t taking any chances. The bakery, Wolfee Donuts in California has reportedly received a docked health grade a day after the incidence was released to the public, and according to Perez Hilton, the Riverside Department of Environmental Health is currently investigating the incident and reviewing whether or not it is in violation of health codes. Considering that everything from diarrhea-inducing listeria to glass was found in food this year, a pint-sized pop star’s saliva is probably the very least of our concerns.",

The 35-year-old Johnson has spent parts or all of the last 12 seasons in Class AAA and has been with seven different organizations. This year, the first baseman was released at Louisville by the Cincinnati Reds but signed on with the Cardinals' Memphis club where he noticed something radically different. Johnson, who was purchased by the Cardinals this week and had two hits and two runs batted in in his first game, said, \"If you have to play in the minor leagues, Memphis was awesome. \"It was the best I've seen. It was unbelievable what the attitudes and the work ethic were. The way the Cardinal Way is taught is just awesome to see. \"The first thing I saw was some of the guys yelling at the TV, screaming and cheering for (the Cardinals). I've seen it different in lots of places. \"Everybody was pulling for everybody. No wonder they're perennial winners every year. If you have that many guys pulling for each other. . . the chemistry is just amazing. Everyone is all about picking the next guy up. \"Guys truly believe they're part of (the Cardinals' team). That's the way the Cardinals run it. Everybody who's been up and back down has carried the same attitude.\" There is some postseason money to be made if you play at least a few days for a playoff team. \"But that's a bonus,\" said Johnson, who also has been in the majors long enough to hit 57 home runs, most of them with Oakland. \"We're all competitors, whether you're paid $1 or $1 million. We're wired that way,\" he said. \"I said that when I got (to Memphis), it was a breath of fresh air. I really enjoyed my time there.\" Even if he would have to go back.",

    "DiffbotBody": "",
    "LabBody": "He was the ultimate outlaw, the wily quarterback from Alabama, the guy who made a career out of throwing caution to the wind. Ken Stabler was the guy who butted heads with Bear Bryant, the non-conformist who threw passes into the night and all the way to last call in Oakland’s most notorious watering holes. Stabler was an American original, and he did it, of course, while studying the game plan “by the light of the juke box.” Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs needed Miami drug dealers. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid would eventually run into the Bolivian Army. And Stabler, try as he might, would eventually see his career take a nosedive in New Orleans. But what a career it was. Stabler, 69, died on Thursday, and he was one of the great originals on the national sports scene over the last 50 years. Terry Bradshaw won more. Dan Fouts had a better arm, a much quicker release. But Stabler was the crafty guy from Foley, Ala., the dude who was the Oilers’ quarterback when the late, great Bum Phillips was shown the door by the AFL’s ultimate carpetbagger, former Titans/Oilers owner Bud Adams. Stabler was the catalyst for those great Oakland Raiders teams of the 1970s, a team best captured in a book entitled “Badasses” by New York writer Peter Richmond. The Pittsburgh Steelers had to survive their free-for-alls with the Raiders to win those four Super Bowls in six seasons. Steelers defensive backs Mel Blount, Mike Wagner and Donnie Shell were great players, but I’d argue the Raiders’ Gene Atkinson, Willie Brown and the late, cheap-shot great Jack Tatum were every bit as effective. Just a little different. Perhaps a little wayward. That’s how John Madden coached. Show up on time, be accountable, do whatever you wanted when the game’s over. As Al Davis told us when he was still with the living (although could we really be sure), the Raiders’ creed was “Just win, baby. Just win.” In 1976, The Snake, as Stabler was known, beat everyone in sight. The Raiders thumped the Steelers in the AFC championship game. They ran the ball behind Art Shell the late Gene Upshaw, and they ran it right down opponents’ collective throat. Stabler was a left-handed quarterback, and the Raid-ahs were a left-handed team. (Some might say underhanded, but it’s a fine line.) No one in their right mind thought the Minnesota Vikings had a chance in Super Bowl XI, and they didn’t. Stabler got the ball to Freddie Biletnikoff in the open field, the Raiders dominated time of possession and Otis Sistrunk, from the “University of Mars,” as NBC’s Al DeRogotis put it, joined forces with the late, narcotic-addled John Matuszak, “The Mad Stork,” Ted Hendricks, and the always colorful Phil Villiapiano to become pro football’s baddest defense. Stabler just called the plays and made the plays in the nightclub when it was over. His numbers were solid, not great. He threw a lot of interceptions. He was willing to run the ball even though he wasn’t particularly fast. He wanted to win. Kenny Stabler ran with some shady characters, too, and legend has it once framed a sportswriter from Sport Magazine who followed him to the notorious Flora-Bama — full disclosure, I was there, three weeks ago — by planting drugs in the well-known scribbler’s rental car. Hey, former Houston Chronicle sports columnist Ed Fowler used to call him “The Serpent”. But Stabler was having too much fun to care. He had a few scrapes with the law along the way, lived to tell about it, and married (and divorced) a cute weather girl from WDSU-TV in New Orleans now known as Rose Stabler. It was Kenny’s life. It’s how he chose to lead it. Still, during my 17 years of covering the SEC for the Biloxi/Gulfport newspaper, Mr. Stabler was always quick with a handshake and a smile at Bryant-Denny Stadium, or Mississippi State’s Scott Field/Davis Wade Stadium. He knew I covered some Oilers games, that I became an NFL beat writer with the Saints back in the ’80s, during my time in Baton Rouge. The Alabama radio color man liked to play the game — of football, of broadcasting, of life — on his own terms. He was nobody’s phony. Gotta respect a man for that. Godspeed, Kenny.

Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton star as villains in their own right. The good news for Universal's bottom line is that the series is already pretty popular. Both \"Despicable Me\" movies did well at the box office, making a combined $619 million in the states. But can they carry a movie on their own? Comingsoon.net says probably, explaining the yellow guys are marketing gold because \"they are cute and their humor is simple enough for even the youngest kids to understand.\" But it's not all good news. That same article points out that animated spin-offs tend not to do as well at the box office. But as Variety reports, the movie has already made more than $141 million in less than three weeks overseas. So it looks like the little guys will probably be just fine.

    "LabBody": "A new flesh-eating culprit has been found on the east coast of the U.S., and this one could be really bad. It all started when Chris Hickey who works with American Medical Response in New Hampshire, was called to revive a man who was literally “rotting away.” Hickey and his crew managed to bring the man back to life, and when he started talking, he revealed to them what he thinks happened to him. It turns out that the anonymous man is a heroin addict, and he is one of the first people in New Hampshire to fall victim to a particularly dangerous form of the drug. According to Mad World News, this drug originated in Russia and was first spotted in the U.S. in the southwest states. Apparently, it has now spread to the east coast. The drug is called Krokodil, and it has already wreaked havoc in Russia. It’s cut with cheap and obscure products in order to maximize the profits for drug dealers. Instead of using pricey painkiller fentanyl to cut the heroin, these dealers use gasoline, paint thinner, drain cleaner, or even ground-up red phosphorus from matchstick tips. When users inject this, it destroys their internal tissue and causes their skin to become green and scaly. If these users manage to survive heroin overdoses, they will likely die from their body being eaten away by this flesh eating concoction.",

    "LabBody": "ELLWOOD CITY -- Police are reviewing public surveillance video in an attempt to determine who damaged a tree in the 400 block of Lawrence Avenue on Thursday morning. A limb was torn from the tree during what Ellwood City police believe was a vehicle accident. Workers from the borough electric department cleared the limb. Although the accident's exact time isn't known, Borough Manager Robert Villella called 911 around 8 a.m. to report the incident. Villella had been checking out road paving work on Fourth Street and the nearly completed demolition of a building for a parking lot at the Ellwood City Public Library when he saw the limb on the ground. A parking meter post also was damaged. \"The limb appears to have been ripped right off,\" he said. Randy Gatto, the borough's public works director, said the tree was among those planted along Lawrence Avenue about 15 years ago. Neither he nor Villella was certain Thursday whether the tree might have been irreparably damaged in the accident.",

    "LabBody": "The third leg of the Hawaii Triple Crown of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, the Kauai Open, will take place Saturday, July 25 at the Island School gym in Puhi. “The Hawaii Triple Crown is the longest-running and the only local (jiu jitsu) event in the state of Hawaii,” said event founder and promoter Romolo Barros on Tuesday. “We’ll probably have about 200 competitors between kids and adults.” Divisions are determined by belt and weight for adults, and belt, weight and age for children. Those who take part will compete for medals and cumulative points. Barros, who is a Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt under Rickson Gracie, added he’s planning to do something different for next year’s event. “I’m doing something for Kauai. We’re going to have belts for Kauai,” he said. “The competitors from Kauai would be able to be Hawaii/Kauai champion. I will make belts for the Kauai leg of the Triple Crown.” Tickets cost $10 for adults and $5 for children, and can be purchased at the door the day of the event. Those who want to enter the competition can register at www.hawaiitriplecrown.com. Deadline to sign up is Wednesday, July 22 at midnight. Following the Kauai event will be the Maui Open in August and Aloha State Championship in November in Honolulu where this year’s champions will be crowned.",
